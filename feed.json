      "Allan Ahlberg, author of over 150 children's books including the classic \u201cEat Peach Pear Plum,\u201d has died at 87",
      "LONDON -- British writer Allan Ahlberg, author of more than 150 children\u2019s books including classics like \u201cEat Peach Pear Plum\u201d and \u201cThe Jolly Postman,\u201d has died, his publisher said Friday. He was 87.",
      "Penguin Random House said Ahlberg died on Tuesday. It did not give a cause of death.",
      "Ahlberg\u2019s books introduced generations of young children to reading through simple rhymes, sharp observation and gentle humor. Many were co-created with his illustrator wife Janet Ahlberg, who died in 1994.",
      "\u201cPeepo!\u201d (1981) gave a baby\u2019s-eye-view of the world and was interactive in a delightfully analogue way, with peep-holes in the pages to spy the next scenes.",
      "\u201cThe Jolly Postman\u201d (1986) was even more inventive, incorporating postcards and letters in envelopes for children to engage with while they followed a letter-carrier delivering mail to fairy tale characters. Penguin Random House said it \u201cpushed at the boundaries of what it is possible for a book to be.\u201d",
      "Ahlberg also wrote books of jokes, including \u201cThe Ha Ha Bonk Book,\u201d and poetry for primary school-age children, including \u201cPlease Mrs. Butler\u201d and \u201cHeard it in the Playground.\u201d",
      "Born in 1938 and raised by adoptive parents in a working-class home in OIdbury, central England, Ahlberg worked as a \u201cpostman, plumber\u2019s mate and grave digger,\u201d according to his publisher, before becoming a teacher. He met Janet at teacher training college and the couple\u2019s first book, \u201cHere are the Brick Street Boys,\u201d was published in 1975.",

      "Prosecutors say they will seek a prison sentence for music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs that is substantially higher than the four to five years they initially expected he might face under federal sentencing guidelines",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors said they now expect music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs could face a prison sentence \u201csubstantially higher\u201d than the four to five years they once thought he was likely to face after his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.",
      "They made the observation late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court written submission in which they also opposed Combs' request this week to be released on $50 million bail while he awaits an Oct. 3 sentencing.",
      "In early July, Combs, 55, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges carrying potential life prison terms but was convicted of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for arranging for girlfriends and male sex workers to travel to engage in sexual encounters that he filmed.",
      "Each prostitution-related charge carries a potential maximum 10 years in prison.",
      "Prosecutors said after the verdict that they thought federal sentencing guidelines meant to prevent wide disparities in sentencings for the same crimes would likely call for a prison term of four to five years. But they said Thursday they believe the guidelines range \u201cwill be substantially higher,\u201d raising the risk Combs will flee.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian will have wide latitude in determining a sentence and can choose to ignore the guidelines, which are not mandatory. Combs' lawyers have said they believe the guidelines, if properly calculated, will call for 21 to 27 months in prison.",
      "On the day of the verdict, prosecutors won a bail fight after defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo argued Combs should be freed immediately on bail.",
      "Subramanian denied the defense request, saying Combs had not met the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence a \u201clack of danger to any person or the community.\u201d But he said Agnifilo could renew the request.",
      "In doing so Tuesday, Agnifilo cited other cases he said were comparable to Combs' conviction in which defendants were granted bail. And he cited severe conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where Combs has been held since his September arrest at a New York hotel.",

As we said in court, this jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life, nor would he do anything to further jeopardize his seven children not having a father, and four of his children not having a parent at all,\u201d Agnifilo wrote earlier this week.",
      "Prosecutors also said conditions at the federal lockup had improved considerably before Combs was arrested. A federal judge in January 2024 had blasted conditions at the jail, including its extensive lockdowns and inadequate medical care.",
      "Prosecutors said cases cited by Agnifilo in which other defendants received bail were not comparable to the crimes Combs was convicted of carrying out, particularly because of his propensity for violence.",
      "\u201cThe defendant's extensive history of violence \u2014 and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct \u2014 demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe defendant utterly fails to establish by clear and convincing evidence, as required, that he does not pose a danger to the community.\u201d",

Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \u201cDon\u2019t Touch Me,\u201d the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",

Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones, and Little Jimmy Dickens.",

      "Harrington Street, which is one block long, will also be called \u201cJerry Garcia Street.\" He died in 1995, but the band's popularity has only grown as younger generations discover the Dead's improvisational music, which blended rock, blues, folk and other styles.",

      "The \u201cSexyBack\u201d singer, who described himself as a private person, wrote he considered ending the tour when diagnosed, but wrote that he \u201cdecided the joy that performing brings me far out weight the fleeting stress my body was feeling. I'm so glad I kept going.\u201d",
      "Lyme disease is transmitted by Ixodes ticks, also known as deer ticks. It can cause flu-like conditions, neurological problems, joint paint and other symptoms. In the vast majority of cases, Lyme disease is successfully treated with antibiotics.",
      "\u201cI honestly don't know what my future is onstage, but I'll always cherish this run! And all of them before! It's been the stuff of legend for me,\u201d Timberlake wrote.",
      "Timberlake canceled and postponed multiple shows throughout the tour's run, citing health issues including bronchitis and laryngitis. Six of his U.S. shows were postponed from October and November to February, the singer announced on Instagram. Timberlake ultimately canceled the last show of the U.S. leg of the tour in Ohio due to the flu in February.",
      "Representatives for Timberlake did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",

      "\u201cFiguring out what makes K-pop tick in a way that resonates with musical fans was really important to this movie,\u201d said Herman.",
      "For Kang, that was always at the heart of the project. \u201cFandom plays a huge part in the world being saved at the end of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we were really confident that we were doing that justice.\u201d",

      "Blues legend Buddy Guy will release a new album on Wednesday, his 89th birthday",
      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

      "\"The Bad Guys 2\" hits theaters, and it's a wild ride",
      "The good news for fans of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d is the new sequel is stellar. But that's because a good portion is actually set in \u2014 are you kidding us? \u2014 outer space. \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d has clearly lost its moorings.",
      "Returning director Pierre Perifel, writers Yoni Brenner and Etan Cohen and the same voice cast have done what all sequels do these days \u2014 amp it all up like everyone is on molly, try to hit the same emotional notes and layer an insane plot with the fate of the world at stake. It's hard to watch a franchise drift so expensively and pointlessly in Earth's orbit.",
      "The gang is all back: Sam Rockwell as Mr. Wolf,Marc Maron as safe-cracker Mr. Snake, Craig Robinson as master-of disguise Mr. Shark, Anthony Ramos as Mr. Piranha and Awkwafina as hacker Ms. Tarantula. We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants to change has to start somewhere,\u201d Mr. Wolf, pushing the George Clooney-like charm offensive, begs one dubious interviewer. \u201cI'm just asking for a chance.\u201d",
      "A life on the straight-and-narrow is hard for four of the former baddies, but not Maron \u2014 so perfectly cast as the grouchy, self-loathing snake. Now he spends his days doing Vinyasa yoga, listening to Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cEspresso,\u201d telling people \"namaste\" and sips wheatgrass kombucha with dandelion. He's even more irritating.",
      "Soon all five are caught in a series of traps and double-crosses by a new robbery crew \u2014 Danielle Brooks\u2019 lollipop-licking venomous snow leopard, Maria Bakalova\u2019s Bulgarian wild boar engineer and Natasha Lyonne\u2019s wry raven, using her same vocal tick as on \u201cPoker Face.\u201d These dames have a plan to get very rich using a substance known as MacGuffinite, a clever \u2014 or lazy \u2014 joke on the object that everyone wants in a movie like this, which drives the plot.",
      "There's soon a trip to a Mexican wrestling festival and then a wedding needs crashing in order to gain control over a rocket owned by an Elon Musk-like billionaire \u2014 voice acted by Colin Jost \u2014 who runs the MoonX company. Then the rocket has to be stopped before a gadget aboard creates a \u201c24-carat catastrophe.\u201d",
      "The animation is amazingly kinetic and with no corners cut, from tiny bugs illuminated in a light beam at night to the bumpy way a truck moves on the highway. The franchise's love of vroooming and fishtailing Looney Tunes-like car chases stays intact, as does the wavy green air farts that emanate from Piranha.",

It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it. We're all over the place.\u201d Left unexplored is the concept of doing wrong for a greater good, and can being bad be excused if it stops a worse badness? \u201cWhat if the bad life was your best life?\u201d asks one of the newcomers. (Another thing to chew on: If \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d is a worse sequel, does that make \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d good?)",
      "When we say the gang is all here, they're all here without any editing: Zazie Beetz returns as Gov. Diane Foxington, Alex Borstein comes back as the top cop and even the kitten from the first film meows in the second.

He threatens again to steal the show and may if there's a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d (There's going to be a \u201cThe Bad Guys 3.\u201d)",
      "The joy of \u201cThe Bad Guys\u201d was that it was a respectful send-up of the movies of Quentin Tarantino and caper flicks like \u201cOcean\u2019s 11.\u201d This time, the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d series gets mocked, as does \u201cSilence of the Lambs,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and maybe \u201cMoonraker,\u201d which is now 46 years old. But the subversion is painfully flat now: The first film in the franchise would have laughed at one climactic line in the second: \u201cWe've got one shot to save the world. Let's make it count!\u201d",
      "The three new villains may be a touch too much for younger viewers \u2014 the violence seems darker and more volcanic this time \u2014 but there's a very loud soundtrack that includes Busta Rhymes, Sofi Tukker and Rag\u2019n\u2019Bone Man.",
      "So what does it all mean? It means the folks behind \u201cThe Bad Guys 2\u201d reunited for a shot to push the franchise into exciting areas, but \u2014 c'mon, everyone \u2014 they didn't make it count.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG for \u201caction/mild violence, rude humor, and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "Rene\u00e9 Rapp's second album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d gave the 25-year-old multi-hyphenate an outlet to work through the whirlwind that has been her career so far",
      "NEW YORK -- Rene\u00e9 Rapp was clear on her intentions for her sophomore album, \u201cBite Me,\u201d from the start.",
      "\u201cI wanted to love this,\u201d Rapp says. \u201cI wanted to be able to walk away from this and be so proud of myself and impressed, no matter what anybody else thought.\u201d Her first album, 2023's \u201cSnow Angel, \u201d  had been an experiment in figuring out her sound (a mix of pop, R&B and heart-wrenching ballads), and assembling a collection of songs that worked together. This album, out Friday, offered the chance to do it again, with an eye toward the way her life had changed in the intervening years.",
      "\u201cThat intention, and also wanting to prove it to myself, was really grueling,\u201d Rapp told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd also really fun.\u201d",
      "The writing process gave Rapp, 25, an outlet to work through the burnout-inducing whirlwind that was her career in those two years. Uncharacteristically restrained in its vocal styling, the album's lead single, \u201cLeave Me Alone,\u201d is strikingly open \u2014 clever zingers allude to her departure from HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d the media frenzy that surrounded her turn as Regina in the 2024 remake of \u201cMean Girls,\u201d and the external pressure she felt to put out more music after the positive reception of \u201cSnow Angel.\u201d Basically, anything that's been said about her in the last few years? She reframes it, poking fun at her reputation and the industry.",
      "\u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d felt like a proper introduction to the album, Rapp says, and \u201cBite Me\u201d \u2014 both a warning and a tease \u2014 the appropriate title. Paris Hilton and Monica Lewinsky were among the famous faces that teased the album upon its announcement, donning merch emblazoned with the title in bold print. Rapp herself posed in front of a newsstand filled with mock tabloids depicting her as a diva, concealed behind big sunglasses and a fur coat, to promote the second single, \u201cMad.\u201d (\u201cThat's a Rapp!\u201d the headline read.)",
      "\u201cIt really feels just like a time capsule of those two years of my life, a lot having to do with the business and the industry and people\u2019s expectations of me,\u201d Rapp says of the album. \u201cAnd then also me wanting things for myself and being confused where those two roads diverge.\u201d",
      "Rapp's confidence and humor is evident across the album, just as it is on stage \u2014 \u201cI write lyrics in the way that I talk,\u201d she says. Many of the tracks tackle the destabilizing emotions that accompany the beginning and end of relationships, whether platonic or romantic, and how her now-very public career has amplified the challenges of creating, and maintaining, those connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so surrounded all the time, but I feel so lonely, and it feels really heavy and isolating. And I think a lot of that is just being an artist. And I also think a lot of that is just like the nature of like the business, for better or for worse,\" she says. The can't-be-bothered attitude heard on \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d is countered by the ache of \u201cThat's So Funny,\u201d which recounts the end of a deeply affecting, but ultimately toxic friendship in Rapp's signature soaring vocals.",

      "In June, Rapp served as a grand marshal of the World Pride parade in Washington, D.C., alongside Laverne Cox and Deacon Maccubbin. \u201cIt can be difficult to feel resilient and empowered as a queer person,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cBecause World Pride was in D.C., I was like, well, I can\u2019t not be there.\u201d She recalled a conversation with Cox, who dispelled some of Rapp's fears of coming off as self-important in the role by emphasizing the power of showing up, and showing face. \u201cRight now, when everything is so under attack, which it pretty much always is, it feels like that\u2019s the time to be really loud.\u201d",
      "Rapp will launch the North American leg of her \u201cBite Me\u201d tour at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheater in September before making stops at New York's Madison Square Garden and as a headliner at the Toronto stop of the All Things Go Festival. She'll tour Europe in March.",
      "As she readies for fans to hear the album, she hopes it offers them some reprieve. \u201cI hope that the weight of the world doesn\u2019t feel as massive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to obsess over everything and be constantly lost in your head.\u201d",
      "Giving them a glimpse into hers, she hopes, is empowering \u2014 and fun: \u201cIt\u2019s just, it feels like a big party that like everybody wants in on.\u201d",

      "He won a following in the 1950s and \u201960s lampooning marriage, politics, racism.",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tom Lehrer, the popular song satirist who lampooned marriage, politics, racism and the Cold War, then largely abandoned his music career to return to teaching math at Harvard and other universities, has died. He was 97.",
      "Longtime friend David Herder said Lehrer died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did not specify a cause of death.",
      "Lehrer had remained on the math faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz well into his late 70s. In 2020, he even turned away from his own copyright, granting the public permission to use his lyrics in any format without any fee in return.",
      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: \u201cGet down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.\u201d)",
      "Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colorful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

      "The FBI will arrange for their return to Reeves, best known for his roles in action franchises like \u201c The Matrix \u201d and \u201c John Wick.\" Chilean prosecutors told reporters that Reeves had identified the watches as those stolen from his Los Angeles home during a string of high-profile burglaries in December 2023.",

      "Noem was also the victim of a robbery attributed to a Chilean national residing illegally in the U.S., when her purse was stolen last April at a Washington restaurant.",

      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d is topping the domestic box office charts in its first weekend in theaters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Marvel\u2019s first family has finally found box office gold. \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d the first film about the superheroes made under the guidance of Kevin Feige and the Walt Disney Co., earned $118 million in its first weekend in 4,125 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "That makes it the fourth biggest opening of the year, behind \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cSuperman,\u201d and the biggest Marvel opening since \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d grossed $211 million out of the gate last summer. Internationally, \u201cFantastic Four\u201d made $100 million from 52 territories, adding up to a $218 million worldwide debut. The numbers were within the range the studio was expecting.",
      "The film arrived in the wake of another big superhero reboot, James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened three weekends ago and has already crossed $500 million globally. That film, from the other main player in comic book films, DC Studios, took second place with $24.9 million domestically.",
      "The box office success of \u201cFirst Steps\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d means \u201cthe whole notion of superhero fatigue, which has been talked about a lot, can I think be put to rest. I always say it\u2019s bad movie fatigue, not superhero fatigue,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the latest attempt at bringing the superhuman family to the big screen, following lackluster performances for other versions. The film, based on the original Marvel comics, is set during the 1960s in a retro-futuristic world led by the Fantastic Four, a family of astronauts-turned-superhuman from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission.",
      "The family is made up of Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), who can stretch his body to incredible lengths; Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), who can render herself invisible; Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), who transforms into a fiery human torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who possesses tremendous superhuman strength with his stone-like flesh.",
      "The movie takes place four years after the family gained powers, during which Reed\u2019s inventions have transformed technology, and Sue\u2019s diplomacy has led to global peace.",
      "Both audiences and critics responded positively to the film, which currently has an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and promising exit poll responses from opening weekend ticket buyers. An estimated 46% of audiences chose to see it on premium screens, including IMAX and other large formats.",
      "The once towering Marvel is working to rebuild audience enthusiasm for its films and characters. Its two previous offerings this year did not reach the cosmic box office heights of \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\" which made over $1.3 billion, or those of the \u201cAvengers\u201d-era. But critically, the films have been on an upswing since the poorly reviewed \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which ultimately grossed $415 million worldwide. \u201cThunderbolts,\" which jumpstarted the summer movie season, was better received critically but financially is capping out at just over $382 million globally.",
      "Like Deadpool and Wolverine, the Fantastic Four characters had been under the banner of 20th Century Fox for years. The studio produced two critically loathed, but decently profitable attempts in the mid-2000s with future Captain America Chris Evans as the Human Torch. In 2015, it tried again (unsuccessfully) with Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. They got another chance after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets in 2019.",
      "The \u201cFantastic Four's\u201d opening weekend results were a little less than some rival studio projections, Dergarabedian said. Nonetheless, the film is expected to carry movie theater earnings well into August.",
      "Holdovers dominated the top 10, but one other newcomer managed to make the chart. The dark romantic comedy \u201cOh, Hi!\u201d earned $1.1 million from 866 screens.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d landed in third place in its fourth weekend with $13 million, followed by \u201cF1\u201d with $6.2 million. The Brad Pitt racing movie also passed $500 million globally. \u201cSmurfs\u201d rounded out the top five with $5.4 million in its second weekend.",

This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",

      "American Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.",
      "In a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d",

The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",

      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",

The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",

      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",

      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",

      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",
      "\u201cFor so long moms have been vilified and not supported,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",

      "A group of more than 20 states are suing the Trump administration over efforts to cut Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",

      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts.

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",

But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",

      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don\u2019t reach that mark, the report said.",
      "The annual report, produced by five U.N. agencies, analyzes trends in efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger around the world by 2030. Those agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.",
      "An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that \u201ccontrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa\u201d and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said.",
      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe must urgently reverse this trajectory,\u201d said M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist with the FAO.",
      "A major mark of distress is the number of Africans unable to afford a healthy diet. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period.",

      "Dr. Vinay Prasad is stepping down as the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s top vaccine regulator after a brief tenure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s polarizing vaccine chief is leaving the agency after a brief tenure that drew the ire of biotech companies, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad \u201cdid not want to be a distraction\u201d and was stepping down from his role as the FDA\u2019s top vaccine regulator \u201cto spend more time with his family,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday.",
      "Two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Prasad was ousted following several recent controversies. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.",
      "Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA\u2019s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "His contrarian approach appeared to match FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who repeatedly praised Prasad\u2019s work and intellect.",
      "But in recent weeks Prasad became a target of conservative activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged Prasad\u2019s past statements criticizing Trump and praising liberal independent Senator Bernie Sanders.",
      "\u201cHow did this Trump-hating Bernie Bro get into the Trump admin???\u201d Loomer posted on X last week.",
      "Prasad also attracted scrutiny for his handling of a recent safety issue surrounding the only approved gene therapy for Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy.",
      "Under his direction, shipments of the therapy were briefly halted after a series of patient deaths, then resumed late Monday following vocal pushback from families of boys with the fatal muscle-wasting disorder.",
      "Prasad has long been skeptical of the therapy and other muscular dystrophy drugs sold by the drugmaker, Sarepta Therapeutics. As an academic, Prasad gained prominence by attacking the FDA for being too lenient in its standards for approving cancer drugs and other new therapies.",
      "That approach is at odds with Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, who generally favor speedier approvals and unfettered access to experimental treatments. During Trump\u2019s first term he signed the \u201c Right to Try \u201d law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "Seventeen experts ousted from a U.S. vaccine committee are expressing little faith in what the panel has become",
      "NEW YORK -- The 17 experts who were ousted from a government vaccine committee last month say they have little faith in what the panel has become, and have outlined possible alternative ways to make U.S. vaccine policy.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly fired the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, accusing them of being too closely aligned with manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. He handpicked replacements that include several vaccine skeptics.",
      "In a commentary published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former panel members wrote that Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official \u2014 and his new panel are abandoning rigorous scientific review and open deliberation.",
      "That was clear, they said, during the new panel's first meeting, in June. It featured a presentation by an anti-vaccine advocate that warned of dangers about a preservative used in a few flu vaccines, but the committee members didn't hear from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staffers about an analysis that concluded there was no link between the preservative and neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The new panel recommended that the preservative, thimerosal, be removed even as some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "\u201cThat meeting was a travesty, honestly,\u201d said former ACIP member Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Stanford University.",
      "The 17 discharged experts last month published a shorter essay in the Journal of the American Medical Association that decried Kennedy's \u201cdestabilizing decisions.\" The focus was largely on their termination and on Kennedy\u2019s decision in May to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "In the new commentary, the ousted committee members took it one step further and prescribed some steps that could be taken to maintain scientifically sound vaccine recommendations.",
      "\u201cAn alternative to the Committee should be established quickly and \u2014 if necessary \u2014 independently from the federal government,\" they wrote. \u201cNo viable pathway exists to fully replace the prior trusted and unbiased ACIP structure and process. Instead, the alternatives must focus on limiting the damage to vaccination policy in the United States.\u201d",
      "Options included having professional organizations working together to harmonize vaccine recommendations or establishing an external auditor of ACIP recommendations. There are huge challenges to the ideas, including having access to the best data, the authors acknowledged.",
      "There's also the question of whether health insurers would pay for vaccinations that are recommended by alternative groups but not ACIP.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV urged hundreds of thousands of young people on Saturday to have the courage to make radical choices to do good, as he presided over his first big encounter with the next generation of Catholics during the highlight of the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year.",
      "Leo encountered a sea of people as he arrived by helicopter at the Tor Vergata field on Rome\u2019s outskirts for a vigil service of the Jubilee of Youth. Hailing from early 150 countries, the pilgrims had set up campsites on the field for the night, as misting trucks and water cannons spritzed them to cool them down from the 30C (85F) temperatures.",
      "Leo displayed his fluency in speaking to the kids in Spanish, Italian and English about the dangers of social media, the value of true friendship and the need to have courage to make radical choices like marriage or religious vows.",
      "\u201cFriendship can really change the world. Friendship is a path to peace,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much the world needs missionaries of the Gospel who are witnesses of justice and peace!\u201d",
      "But history's first American pope also alerted them to some tragic news: Two young people who had made the pilgrimage to Rome had died, one reportedly of cardiac arrest, while a third was hospitalized, Leo told the crowd during the vigil service.",
      "Leo was to return to the field for an early morning Mass on Sunday morning to close out the celebration.",
      "For the past week, these bands of young Catholics from around the world have poured into Rome for their special Jubilee celebration, in a Holy Year in which 32 million people are expected to descend on the Vatican to participate in a centuries-old pilgrimage to the seat of Catholicism.",
      "The young people have been traipsing down cobblestoned streets in color-coordinated T-shirts, praying the Rosary and singing hymns with guitars, bongo drums and tambourines shimmying alongside. Using their flags as tarps to shield them from the sun, they have taken over entire piazzas for Christian rock concerts and inspirational talks, and stood for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to 1,000 priests offering the sacrament in a dozen different languages.",
      "\u201cIt is something spiritual, that you can experience only every 25 years,\u201d said Francisco Michel, a pilgrim from Mexico. \u201cAs a young person, having the chance to live this meting with the pope I feel it is a spiritual growth.\u201d",
      "It all has the vibe of a World Youth Day, the Catholic Woodstock festival that St. John Paul II inaugurated and made famous in Rome in 2000 at the very same Tor Vergata field. Then, before an estimated 2 million people, John Paul told the young pilgrims they were the \u201csentinels of the morning\u201d at the dawn of the third millennium.",
      "Officials had initially expected 500,000 youngsters this weekend, but Leo and organizers from the stage said the number could reach 1 million. The Vatican didn't immediately provide a final estimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit messed up, but this is what is nice about the Jubilee,\u201d said Chloe Jobbour, a 19-year-old Lebanese Catholic who was in Rome with a group of more than 200 young members of the Community of the Beatitudes, a France-based charismatic group.",

But Jobbour, like many in Rome this week, didn\u2019t mind the discomfort: It\u2019s all part of the experience.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect it to be better than that. I expected it this way,\u201d she said, as members of her group gathered on church steps near the Vatican to sing and pray Saturday morning before heading out to Tor Vergata.",
      "Those Romans who didn't flee the onslaught have been inconvenienced by the additional strain on the city's notoriously insufficient public transport system. Residents are sharing social media posts of outbursts by Romans at kids flooding subway platforms and crowding bus stops that have delayed and complicated their commutes to work.",
      "But other Romans have welcomed the enthusiasm the youngsters have brought. Premier Giorgia Meloni offered a video welcome, marveling at the \u201cextraordinary festival of faith, joy and hope\u201d that the young people had created.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s marvelous,\u201d said Rome hairdresser Rina Verdone, who lives near the Tor Vergata field and woke up Saturday to find a gaggle of police outside her home as part of the massive, 4,000-strong operation mounted to keep the peace. \u201cYou think the faith, the religion is in difficulty, but this is proof that it\u2019s not so.\u201d",
      "Verdone had already made plans to take an alternate route home Saturday afternoon, that would require an extra kilometer (half-mile) walk, because she feared the \u201cinvasion\u201d of kids in her neighborhood would disrupt her usual bus route. But she said she was more than happy to make the sacrifice.",

It asked residents to be vigilant about heavy rainfall that could trigger lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano.",

      "\u201cWeddings in America can be a little too grand and a little bit too big and it ends up not really being about the couple,\u201d said Fortino, 28, a neonatal nurse from Skaneateles, New York. \u201cWe both just really wanted something intimate and meaningful.\u201d",
      "Over 15,000 foreign couples wed in Italy last year, up 64% from 2019, the year before the pandemic, according to market research from the Center of Tourist Studies of Florence. Growth was led by U.S couples, who account for almost one-third of that total.",
      "Italy was the top international destination for American couples after Mexico, according to Maryland-based wedding planning website The Knot.",
      "For many Americans, Italy embodies the simple, beautiful romance of a bygone era. Weather is balmy and its varied landscapes, from the sea to the mountains, stunning. The food is familiar and crowd-pleasing. But perhaps the biggest driver of the recent uptick is ample opportunity for a range of outings, which together with the wedding event are alluring for those on a quest for unique, memorable moments \u2014 part of a consumer trend termed \u201cthe experience economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the United States, everything is just more expensive for one night and we wanted to make an experience, so we did two nights here,\" said Atkinson, 31, who owns a concrete company. \u201cIt just seemed like way more worth it to us to do that and make a trip out of it with our family, our loved ones.\u201d",
      "One guest who had never visited Italy was ecstatic about the invite, and took advantage to tack on side trips, first to Venice and then with the wedding crew to Cinque Terre. Another, Gary Prochna, nearly didn\u2019t attend because of work piling up at his paving company. He eventually came around and was floored by the venue \u2014 a 15th-century villa with a sweeping view over Florence and its famous Duomo.",
      "\u201cI got married in the United States and our venue was very nice. I thought \u2014 until this moment \u2014 we had the best wedding,\u201d said Prochna, 68, adding that he now hopes his daughters will get hitched abroad.",
      "Marcy Blum, a prominent luxury event planner based in Manhattan, said almost 90% of the weddings she plans are in Italy.",
      "\u201cThe reason Italy is so popular is because that\u2019s where your guests want to go,\u201d she said. \"You send an invitation that you\u2019re getting married in Capri or Positano and everybody comes. Everybody. They want to come. Nobody cancels.\u201d",

      "The threat of tariffs under President Donald Trump has given destination weddings a boost. Ezon has moved six events from the U.S. to Europe this year, because people were afraid tariffs on alcohol would cause their bar bill to explode.",
      "The shift to destinations has benefited planners with networks across Italy and local vendors.

      "Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathawa...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprise shareholders by selling off a huge chunk of its Apple stake which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft\u2019s core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",

Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of student borrowers could begin having their wages garnished as soon as this summer, according to estimates from credit bureau TransUnion.",
      "The company predicts that by August roughly 3 million borrowers could move into default, meaning they're 270 days past due on payments. At that point, loan holders are at risk of having 15% of their pay docked by the government, with the money going toward the outstanding debt. There has been no clear indication of when wage garnishment will start.",
      "After the pandemic-era pause on student loan payments ended in May, borrowers have had to reassess the state of their loans and budgets. According to TransUnion, another 2 million borrowers are on course to default in September.",
      "A Biden-administration grace period, during which late or missed payments were not counted against credit scores, ended in the fall.",
      "Since then, millions of borrowers have seen hits to their credit ratings.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "\u201cThe most important thing borrowers can do before administrative wage garnishment restarts is to log into studentaid.gov to check whether their federal student loans are in default and take steps now to remove them from default,\u201d said Kyra Taylor, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.",
      "Taylor said it's not uncommon for borrowers to be unaware that their loans are in default. If borrowers attended college or graduate school during different periods of time, or if they have different federal loan types, they may also have multiple student loan servicers.",
      "If that's the case, you should act now to get your loans out of default and back into good standing by either entering a rehabilitation agreement, where you must make nine consecutive payments based on their income, or by consolidating your loans into a new federal Direct Loan.",
      "\u201cBecause this hasn\u2019t happened for so long, there are many people who have no idea they\u2019re at risk,\" said Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "Wait times for student borrowers attempting to contact their loan servicers have been long, with many dropped calls, in part due to layoffs at the Education Department. Ba\u00f1ez recommends contacting your congressperson, using a casework tool that can guide you through submitting a constituent request.",
      "\u201cThese offices have entire teams dedicated to constituent casework for when you have an issue with a federal agency, such as the Department of Education,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you can request assistance from your member of congress \u2014 your representative or senator.\u201d",
      "Until past due payments are paid or the loan's default status is resolved, borrowers are at risk of having up to 15% of their wages deducted directly from their paychecks.",

      "Richelle Brooks, 37, an education administrator based in Los Angeles, said she's received warnings and notices about the resumption of collection of her loans. For several degrees, she still has $239,000 in outstanding debt, and she was informed her monthly payments on those loans will be roughly $3,000.",
      "\u201cI can't afford it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just came out of the moratorium \u2014 not paying for five years. People getting these notices \u2014 they're terrified. I'm uneasy, too.\"",
      "Brooks said she's an informed borrower who stays up to date on each development and who knows her options. She plans to enroll in coding classes, at least half-time, which could place her loans in deferment, so she wouldn't be required to make monthly payments, while she makes a financial plan.",
      "There's still time to take action.",
      "According to Taylor, the Department of Education must provide 30 days notice before it sends a garnishment order to your employer. During that time, you can request a hearing to object by telling the department that the garnishment would cause you financial hardship. You can also request that the department reduce the amount being garnished and submit documentation about your income and expenses.",
      "To do this, you must make your hearing request in writing, postmarked no later than 30 days after the garnishment order. Your loan holder will then arrange the hearing. If you're unsure who your loan holder is, you can contact the Education Department's Default Resolution Group.",
      "If you were laid off from your last job, you can also object to garnishment if you have not been in your current job for 12 consecutive months. You can further request a hearing and object if you submitted an application for certain kinds of statutory discharges and those have not yet been decided. Some common reasons for statutory discharge of student loans include: if the school you attended closed before you could complete your degree, if your school owes you a refund but fails to pay it, if you're experiencing total disability, or if you're experiencing bankruptcy.",
      "\u201cIf the borrower requests a hearing within 30 days after receiving the garnishment notice, the department cannot start garnishment until it issues a decision on the borrower\u2019s objections and financial hardship request,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "You can request a hearing after the 30 day period is up, but in those cases the department will generally not stop garnishing your wages while the hearing request is pending.",

      "MIAMI -- A Miami jury decided that Elon Musk\u2019s car company Tesla was partly responsible for a deadly crash in Florida involving its Autopilot driver assist technology and must pay the victims more than $200 million in punitive damages.",
      "The federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility because its technology failed and that not all the blame can be put on a reckless driver, even one who admitted he was distracted by his cell phone before hitting a young couple out gazing at the stars. The decision comes as Musk seeks to convince Americans his cars are safe enough to drive on their own as he plans to roll out a driverless taxi service in several cities in the coming months.",
      "The decision ends a four-year long case remarkable not just in its outcome but that it even made it to trial. Many similar cases against Tesla have been dismissed and, when that didn't happen, settled by the company to avoid the spotlight of a trial.",
      "\u201cThis will open the floodgates,\u201d said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \u201cIt will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\u201d",
      "The case also included startling charges by lawyers for the family of the deceased, 22-year-old, Naibel Benavides Leon, and for her injured boyfriend, Dillon Angulo. They claimed Tesla either hid or lost key evidence, including data and video recorded seconds before the accident.",
      "Tesla has previously faced criticism that it is slow to cough up crucial data by relatives of other victims in Tesla crashes, accusations that the car company has denied. In this case, the plaintiffs showed Tesla had the evidence all along, despite its repeated denials, by hiring a forensic data expert who dug it up. Tesla said it made a mistake after being shown the evidence and honestly hadn\u2019t thought it was there.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong,\" Tesla said in a statement, \u201cand only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\u201d They said the plaintiffs concocted a story \u201dblaming the car when the driver \u2013 from day one \u2013 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d",
      "In addition to the punitive award, the jury said Tesla must also pay $49 million in compensatory damages, bringing the total borne by the company to $249 million.",

      "It\u2019s not clear how much of a hit to Tesla\u2019s reputation for safety the verdict in the Miami case will make. Tesla has vastly improved its technology since the crash on a dark, rural road in Key Largo, Florida, in 2019.",
      "But the issue of trust generally in the company came up several times in the case, including in closing arguments Thursday. The plaintiffs\u2019 lead lawyer, Brett Schreiber, said Tesla\u2019s decision to even use the term Autopilot showed it was willing to mislead people and take big risks with their lives because the system only helps drivers with lane changes, slowing a car and other tasks, falling far short of driving the car itself.",
      "Schreiber said other automakers use terms like \u201cdriver assist\u201d and \u201ccopilot\u201d to make sure drivers don\u2019t rely too much on the technology.",

      "The Tahoe spun around so hard it was able to launch Benavides 75 feet through the air into nearby woods where her body was later found. It also left Angulo, who walked into the courtroom Friday with a limp and cushion to sit on, with broken bones and a traumatic brain injury.",
      "But Schreiber said Tesla was at fault nonetheless. He said Tesla allowed drivers to act recklessly by not disengaging the Autopilot as soon as they begin to show signs of distraction and by allowing them to use the system on smaller roads that it was not designed for, like the one McGee was driving on.",
      "\u201cI trusted the technology too much,\u201d said McGee at one point in his testimony. \u201cI believed that if the car saw something in front of it, it would provide a warning and apply the brakes.\u201d",
      "The lead defense lawyer in the Miami case, Joel Smith, countered that Tesla warns drivers that they must keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel yet McGee chose not to do that while he looked for a dropped cell phone, adding to the danger by speeding. Noting that McGee had gone through the same intersection 30 or 40 times previously and hadn\u2019t crashed during any of those trips, Smith said that this isolates the cause to one thing alone: \u201cThe cause is that he dropped his cell phone.\u201d",

      "Williams and her husband, Tate, raise about 70 cow-calf pairs near Letcher in southeastern South Dakota, roughly 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Mitchell. They own about 80 acres (32 hectares) and rent additional pasture.",
      "Between the drought that hit cattle country hard over the last few years, still being maxed out on the grass available to feed their animals, and with land prices rising, she said, they simply can\u2019t yet make the financial investments that they\u2019d need to raise production.",
      "\u201cIt is a goal of ours to expand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure if that will be in the 10-year plan or even longer.\u201d",
      "Farmers and ranchers across the U.S. would love to take greater advantage of the high prices, but with the U.S. herd at record lows, they can\u2019t meet the demand quickly. It's basic biology.",
      "\u201cIt takes three years to get more cows \u2014 between making a decision, having that gestation period, having the calf born, raising the calf until it, too, can have a calf,\" said Michael Swanson, chief agricultural economist for the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute in Minneapolis.",
      "The Williamses' county was hard hit by drought over the previous few seasons. Because of the lack of their grass and uneconomically high hay prices, they had to sell all their young females last year that could have produced more calves for them this year, she said.",
      "Their area has caught some rain lately, though. It has improved to just \u201cabnormally dry\u201d in recent U.S. Drought Monitor reports. But Williams said they\u2019re simply playing catch-up.",
      "Swanson said some of the main cattle areas in North America \u2014 from Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada down to Texas in the U.S. \u2014 are just naturally prone to drought. It's often boom or bust.",
      "Colin Woodall, CEO of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association, said a lot of cattle country has had good rain this summer, but it's a cyclical business.",
      "\u201cSometimes we have good times, and sometimes we don\u2019t,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cAnd we are just coming off what was a pretty significant negative hit to the cattle industry in \u201919, \u201920 and \u201921, with the height of the pandemic. So we have a lot of producers who are still trying to pay off bills from those times.\"",
      "And Woodall said his members are still leery. They're asking how long the better weather will last.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting some good moisture now. But will it be that way in the fall? Will it be that way next year?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the last thing you want to do is pay to rebuild your herd and then just have to liquidate them again in six months to a year.\u201d",
      "Although it\u2019s difficult to attribute any single weather event, such as a drought, directly to climate change, scientists say that rising temperatures stoked by climate change are increasing the odds of both severe droughts and heavier precipitation, which wreak havoc on people and the environment.",
      "When extreme weather collides with tight margins, farmers and ranchers feel the squeeze.",
      "Retail beef prices have hit record highs with no relief for consumers in sight. Ground beef rose to an average of $6.12 per pound in June, up nearly 12% from 2024. The average price of all steaks rose 8% to $11.49 per pound.",

      "LONDON -- On a charming cobblestone street tucked away in London\u2019s East End, a pub proudly hangs out a sign that reads \u201cOldest riverside pub in London.\u201d Across the Thames River, a pub with a different name makes the same bold claim.",
      "The unofficial title of the oldest riverside pub in the city has long been disputed, with both the Mayflower and the Prospect of Whitby laying claim to the title.",
      "The two contenders can be found along a quiet stretch of the Thames, far from the city\u2019s crowded souvenir shops and tourist sites, serving up traditional British dishes \u2014 from steak and ale pie to sticky toffee pudding \u2014 with a side of history.",
      "The Mayflower is named after the Pilgrim Mayflower ship, which set sail from the site in 1620 to begin its journey to America. Though it only got its name in 1957, it is said to have some of the ship\u2019s original timbers incorporated into its structure.",
      "Today, pubgoers who can prove direct descent from one of the Mayflower passengers can sign its \u201cDescendants Book.\u201d",
      "Every night, tourists step out of black cabs at the doors of the two pubs, trading the capital\u2019s modern skyscrapers for the storied streets of London\u2019s East End, lined with quaint terraced houses and red brick warehouses.",
      "In both pubs they enter spaces where old paintings hanging on dark paneled walls and other mementos of their histories seem to leave the contemporary world behind.",
      "\u201cThere really is a feeling that you might have stepped back in time and could be drinking beer with sailors or pirates or anybody from any Dickens novels really,\" said Emily Godwin, a Londoner who has been to both. She spoke while sipping a pint of lager with friends at the Prospect on a recent summer evening.",
      "The Prospect boasts a pewter bar \u2013 the longest of its kind in Britain \u2014 where the infamous \u201cHanging Judge Jeffreys\u201d is said to have watched the many hangings that took place at the nearby \u201cExecution Dock.\u201d Early on, the pub was known as the Devil\u2019s Tavern due to its association with thieves and smugglers. A hanging noose outside serves as a reminder of the pub\u2019s grisly history.",
      "It \u201cfeels like such a pocket of history in London,\u201d Godwin said. \u201cSo much of London\u2019s East End feels very new and trendy, and the Prospect feels like it\u2019s barely changed.\u201d",
      "British pubs have always been at the center of social life, with locals coming together over a pint, even in times of war and economic hardship. But the last five years have been challenging for the industry as pubs contended with the COVID-19 pandemic and rising costs.",
      "This year an estimated 378 venues are set to shutter across England, Wales, and Scotland, according to the British Beer and Pub Association.",
      "\u201cWhen a pub closes, it puts people out of a job, deprives communities of their heart and soul and hurts the local economy,\u201d said Emma McClarkin, head of the BBPA.",

      "The Prospect claims it was established in 1520, with its original flagstone surviving an arson attack in 1666 \u2014 the same year as the Great Fire of London. The pub was outside of the city limits at that time and was not affected by the conflagration that gutted the medieval city.",
      "Justin Billington, assistant manager at the Prospect, said some people date the pub to its full reconstruction in 1774 after the 1666 fire. But he doesn't see it that way, noting that it operated continuously. The day after the fire, the workers rolled out a barrel of beer that had survived the flames and locals showed up with their tankards, drinking vessels, and enjoyed a drink on the spot.",
      "There were several reconstructions in the pub's subsequent history, but none withstood the salt water and shifting foundations of the Thames, Billington explained. Not, that is, until 1774 when the retired captain of a merchant ship called \u201cThe Prospect\u201d rebuilt it using the ship.",
      "\u201cThis rebuild held and continues to hold on for dear life,\" he said.",
      "If the pub was actually established in 1774, that would make the Mayflower \u2014 established in the 16th century \u2014 older.",
      "But there are no hard feelings between the pubs as Billington described their competition as a \u201cloving rivalry.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe compete against each other to be the oldest, and to serve the best food and drink,\u201d he said.",
      "But the question remains: How can either pub definitively claim the title?",
      "Unlike the title of the \u201cOldest pub in England,\u201d held by the Porch House in southern England, which is said to date to the 10th century, there is no official certification for the oldest pub in London.",
      "Guinness World Records said it has not formally awarded the title because of the complexities created by numerous name changes, relocations and reconstructions.",
      "\u201cThere are lots of very old pubs that might make a claim to being oldest, but it could be contested because it could be argued they weren\u2019t always in \u2018London,\u2019\u201d English historian and author Jacob Field said. \u201cMany pubs have changed name over time, making it hard to claim they are the oldest.\"",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariff rates of up to 41% on U.S. imports from dozens of countries drew expressions of relief Friday from some countries that negotiated a deal or managed to whittle them down from rates announced in April. Others expressed disappointment or frustration over running out of time after hitting Trump's Aug. 1 deadline for striking deals with America\u2019s trading partners.",
      "The new rates are due to take effect on Aug. 7, but uncertainty over what Trump might do next remains. The way ahead for China, which runs the largest trade surplus with the U.S., is unclear after talks earlier this week in Stockholm produced no deal. Trump has yet to say if he'll extend an Aug. 12 pause on painfully high import duties on Chinese products.",
      "The reaction from financial markets was muted. Benchmarks fell in Asia, with South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropping nearly 4% after the tariff rate for the U.S. ally was set at 15%. The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, trading at more than 150 yen per dollar.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government was disappointed by Trump's move to raise the U.S. tariff on goods from America's northern neighbor to 35% from 25%, effective Friday. Goods transshipped from unspecified other countries face a 40% import duty.",
      "Trump cited what he said was a lack of cooperation in stemming trafficking in illicit drugs across the northern border. He also slammed Canada's plan to recognize a Palestinian state and has expressed frustration with a trade deficit largely fueled by U.S. oil purchases.",

      "Switzerland was reeling after Trump ordered a 39% tariff rate for the land of luxury watches, pharmaceuticals and financial services. That was up from his original proposal of a 31% duty.",
      "\u201cThe Federal Council notes with great regret that, despite the progress made in bilateral talks and Switzerland\u2019s very constructive stance from the outset, the U.S. intends to impose unilateral additional tariffs on imports from Switzerland,\u201d the government said in a post on X. It said it would continue to seek a negotiated solution.",
      "New Zealand officials said Friday they would keep lobbying Trump to cut the 15% tariff he announced for their country\u2019s exports to the U.S., up from the original 10% baseline set in April.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a good thing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s warranted,\u201d Trade Minister Todd McClay told Radio New Zealand. The exporter of meat, dairy, wine and farm machinery ran a $1.1 billion trade surplus with the U.S. in 2024, according to U.S. Trade Representative data.",
      "McClay said New Zealand exporters had reported they could absorb a 10% tariff or pass it on to U.S. consumers through increased costs. A further increase would \u201cchange the equation,\u201d he said.",

      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",

Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",

Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",

      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher. The figures are above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.",
      "The uptick in prices helps explain the central bank\u2019s reluctance to cut its key interest rate this week, despite repeated demands from Trump that it do so. On Wednesday, the Fed left its key rate unchanged at 4.3%, and Chair Fed Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the import duties will cause just a one-time rise in prices or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than consistent with the 2% target.",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",

      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags. Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government\u2019s calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",

      "\u201cNot the case at all,\u201d Hawley said on \u201cJesse Watters Primetime.\u201d",
      "It was the second time in many days that Trump laid into senators in his own party as the president tries, sometimes without success, to publicly pressure them to fall in line. Earlier, Trump tore into veteran GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa over an obscure Senate procedure regarding nominations.",
      "In a social media post, Trump called Hawley a \u201csecond-tier Senator\u201d who was playing into the hands of Democrats.",
      "Trump added: \u201cI don\u2019t think real Republicans want to see their President, who has had unprecedented success, TARGETED, because of the \u2018whims\u2019 of a second-tier Senator named Josh Hawley!\u201d",
      "Stock trading by members of Congress has long been an issue that both parties have tried to tackle, especially as some elected officials have become wealthy while in elected office. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, it was disclosed that lawmakers were trading as information about the health crisis before it became public. Insider trading laws don\u2019t always apply to the types of information lawmakers receive.",
      "Hawley\u2019s legislation with the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, sailed out of the Senate\u2019s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, after his support delivered a bipartisan vote over the objections of the other Republicans, who have majority control.",
      "GOP senators had been working with the White House on the stock trade bill, and some supported a broad carve-out to exclude the president from the ban, but it failed, with Hawley joining Democrats to block it.",
      "Trump also complained that Hawley joined with Democrats to block another amendment that would have investigated the stock trades of Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emerita, and her spouse. Paul Pelosi has been a much-watched trader, but the California lawmaker's office said she personally does not own stock.",
      "Hawley said after his conversation with Trump that the president \u201creiterated to me he wants to see a ban on stock trading by people like Nancy Pelosi and members of Congress, which is what we passed.\u201d The senator also suggested the Democratic leader should be prosecuted, but it\u2019s not clear on what grounds.",
      "Pelosi has said repeatedly that she\u2019s not involved in her husband\u2019s work on investments, strongly supports the bill and looks forward to voting for it in the House.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve confidence that their elected leaders are serving the public interest \u2014 not their personal portfolios,\u201d she said.",

An earlier proposal from Hawley, named after Pelosi, had focused more narrowly on lawmakers.",
      "If the bill were to become law, it would immediately prohibit elected officials, including the president, from buying stocks and would ban them from selling stocks for 90 days after enactment. It also requires the elected officials to divest from all covered investments, but not until the beginning of their next term in office \u2014 shielding the term-limited president from that requirement.",

Rick Scott of Florida proposed one amendment that would exempt the president, the vice president, their spouses and dependent children from the legislation, and the other one that would have required a report on the Pelosi family\u2019s trades.

The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.",
      "It has. The question now is whether some of the public reaction the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.",
      "Titled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "Marcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism for the American Eagle ad could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.",
      "\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d",
      "Other commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign's message.",
      "\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.",

      "A day after Sweeney was announced as the company's latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle's stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.",
      "Like many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.",
      "Adamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields' age.",

      "And he didn't hold back in an interview with The Associated Press over the shaky state of American swimming. He's calling for big-time changes as the Americans struggle at the world championships in Singapore.",
      "The American team isn't winning as much as expected or dominating, it's battling a case of \u201cacute gastroenteritis\u201d picked up at training camp in Thailand before arriving in Singapore, and the governing body \u2014 USA Swimming \u2014 has been without a CEO for a year.",
      "Gaines called the body \u201drudderless.\"",
      "\u201cCan you imagine any corporation going for a year without a CEO?\u201d Gaines asked.",
      "The Americans were also underwhelming a year ago at the Paris Olympics. They led the medal table, but won only eight gold medals, the lowest total since the 1988 Seoul Olympics.",
      "\u201cWe're far from killing it,\" said Gaines in a telephone interview from the United States. \"It\u2019s a major struggle and we can\u2019t hide our heads in the sand and say this is just a blip.\u201d",

      "The American haven't said how many swimmers have fallen ill, but in an interview Meehan said \u201cthe overwhelming majority of the team has gone through something\u201d at the championship.\"",
      "\u201cGreg and I have been going back and forth in a very good way, very positive,\" Gaines said.",
      "He called Meehan a good choice and said he's had too little time to turn things around. Gaines also pointed out that the focus is the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. These world championships, less so.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s (Meehan) going to be great,\" Gaines said. \"He\u2019s got that calm reserve. He had great success at Stanford. He\u2019s coached some of the best swimmers ever. I think he\u2019s a good choice, he\u2019s just walking into a bit of a landmine.\u201d",
      "Like many, Gaines questioned why the Americans picked Thailand as a training camp site and noted that global swimming now has dozens of countries that can beat the Americans, and many of their elite athletes train in the States.",
      "Those include the two stars in Singapore: Frenchman L\u00e9on Marchand and Canadian Summer McIntosh. Marchand trains at the University of Texas at Austin, and McIntosh will be there this fall and join Bob Bowman's training group.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Department of Defense will now continue sharing key data collected by three weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes. Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",
      "Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",
      "In a notice on Wednesday, officials said there would be no interruption at all.",
      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",
      "The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. It gives crucial information about storms that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional visible or infrared satellites.",
      "\u201cThis satellite data enables hurricane forecasters and their computer models to peer inside a hurricane\u2019s structure, offering vital insight,\" said Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi. \"Make no mistake: this data not only improves hurricane forecasting accuracy, but could make the difference between whether communities evacuate or not ahead of an approaching hurricane.\u201d",
      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program\u2019s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set \u201cin a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to \u201censure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Fireflies are lighting up summer evenings across the U.S. Northeast, putting on dazzling shows in backyards and city parks.",
      "There's no official count, but experts say a particularly wet spring may have created the ideal conditions for young fireflies to grow into adults to set summer nights aglow.",
      "Fireflies light the night everywhere: There are over 2,000 known species across the globe. They use their characteristic flashes to communicate and find the perfect mate.",

      "While northeastern nights may seem brighter this summer, the bugs are still on the decline and they're waning at a faster rate than ever before.",
      "\u201cIt would be a mistake to say firefly populations are high this year, therefore there's no decline,\u201d said Matt Schlesinger with the New York Natural Heritage Program, who is part of an effort to count fireflies in state parks.",
      "Some firefly species could be doing well this year, Schlesinger said, while others are still on the decline.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticide use and light pollution are responsible. In cities, blaring lights from billboards, cars and storefronts can drown out the bugs' glow, making it harder for them to find their kin and pass their genes onto the next generation.",
      "Fireflies are part of the story of summer, said entomologist Jessica Ware with the American Museum of Natural History. Her children grew up seeing them flash in her backyard, but the bugs started to disappear once her kids hit their teenage years.",

      "After recording more than 600 audiobooks, Julia Whelan has become a go-to narrator for books by popular authors including Emily Henry and Taylor Jenkins Reid",
      "Chances are, you've heard Julia Whelan's voice. She's the award-winning narrator behind more than 600 audiobooks by a long list of bestselling authors including Taylor Jenkins Reid,Emily Henry, Michael Crichton, V.E. Schwab and Kristin Hannah. She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",
      "You may have even seen Whelan on TV \u2014 she began her career as a child actor, with roles in \u201cFifteen and Pregnant\u201d and on the series \u201cOnce and Again.\u201d Despite her various pursuits, though, she has no plans to leave narration behind. \u201cI feel like I was born to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I love and that I\u2019m good at and everything I want to be doing.\u201d",
      "That's a good thing, because the audiobook industry is growing. Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask. Despite the appetite for audiobooks, for narrators, \u201cthe financial aspect makes zero sense,\u201d says Whelan. She's founded her own publishing company, Audiobrary, to help narrators get paid more fairly.",
      "Whelan, who has narrated as many as 70 books in one year, spoke to The Associated Press about the audiobook industry, Audiobrary and her own writing. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

      "WHELAN: I very much think we could. I have said no up to this point because, this time around, I want to be very creatively involved. There\u2019s just too many things about audiobooks that someone could get wrong not knowing anything about the industry.

      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

      "Computer software is widely used in music production, and artificial intelligence is just the latest tool that disc jockeys, music producers and others have added to their production pipeline. But the rise of AI song generators such as Suno and Udio is set to transform the industry because they allow anyone to create songs with just a few prompts.",
      "While some people do not care whether they're listening to AI-generated music, others might be curious to know.",
      "If you encounter a new song that leaves you wondering whether it's 100% made with AI, there are some methods that could reveal how it was created.",
      "If you're wondering who's behind a song, try some old-fashioned detective work.",
      "The \u201cmost obvious cues\u201d come from \u201cexternal factors,\u201d said Manuel Mousallam, head of research and development at streaming service Deezer.",
      "Does the band or artist have social media accounts? Lack of a social presence might indicate there's no one there. If they do exist online, examine the kind of content they post, and how long it goes back.",
      "Is there any sign that the artist or band exists in real life? Are there any upcoming concerts and can you buy a ticket for a gig? Is there footage of past concerts on YouTube? Has an established record label released their singles or albums?",
      "Try going to the source. Song creators often \u2014 but not always \u2014 publish their generated tunes on the Suno or Udio platforms, where they can be found by other users.",
      "The catch is that you'll have to sign up for an account to get access. Users can look up songs by track name or the creator's handle, and browse genres and playlists. But it can still be difficult to spot a song, especially if you don't know the name of the song or creator.",

      "As a cross-check, I also uploaded some old MP3s from my song library, which got a very low AI probability score.",

      "Casual users, though, might prefer to just let the machine write them. So bad rhyming schemes or repetitive lyrical structures might be a clue that a song is not man-made. But it's subjective.",

      "Elon Musk is a kingmaker on X",
      "ROME -- Hard-right commentators, politicians and activists in Europe have uncovered a secret to expanding their influence: engaging with Elon Musk.",
      "Take the German politician from a party whose own domestic intelligence agency has designated as extremist. Her daily audience on X surged from 230,000 to 2.2 million on days Musk interacted with her posts. She went on to lead her party to its best-ever electoral showing.",
      "Or the anti-immigration activist in Britain, who was banned from Twitter and sentenced to 18 months in prison for contempt of court. Since Musk let him back on the platform in late 2023, he\u2019s mentioned, reposted or replied to the billionaire more than 120 times on X \u2014 and gained nearly a million followers.",
      "Even a little-known social-media influencer turned politician from Cyprus has benefited from the Musk effect. Before winning a surprise seat in the European Parliament, where he\u2019s advocated for Musk, the influencer seemed to have one ambition: to hug the world\u2019s richest man. He got his hug \u2014 and political endorsements. On days Musk has interacted with his account on X, the man\u2019s audience exploded from just over 300,000 to nearly 10 million views.",
      "Elon Musk may have tumbled from political grace in Washington -- he stepped down as an adviser to President Donald Trump in May and has since traded insults with the president -- but as he works to build his own political party, his power on X his power remains unchecked.",
      "Musk\u2019s influence on the platform he bought for $44 billion has made him a kingmaker at home and abroad. Among those he has chosen to cultivate are hard-right politicians and insurgent influencers across Europe, according to an Associated Press analysis of public data. His dominance, which has real-world financial and political impacts, is fueling concerns in Europe about foreign meddling -- not from Russia or China this time, but from the United States.",
      "\u201cEvery alarm bell needs to ring,\u201d said Christel Schaldemose, a vice president of the European Parliament who works on electoral interference and digital regulation. \u201cWe need to make sure that power is not unbalanced.\u201d",
      "In seeking to quantify Musk\u2019s effect on European politics, The Associated Press analyzed more than 20,000 posts over a three-year period from 11 far-right European figures across six countries who frequently promote a hard-right political or social agenda and had significant interactions with Elon Musk since he purchased Twitter. Tens of thousands of posts by Musk on Twitter, now known as X, were also collected.",
      "The AP used the records, obtained from data provider Bright Data, to analyze how Musk\u2019s account interacted with the European influencers, and vice versa, and the extent to which Musk\u2019s engagement boosted their reach.",
      "These case studies are not meant to be representative of a broad universe; rather, they showcase the ways in which Musk\u2019s engagement can have an impact on local influencers who share his views.",
      "Due to limitations on data collection, the dataset is not a complete record of all posts made by these accounts. Even so, it captured at least 920 instances in which one of the European accounts tagged, replied or otherwise attempted to interact with Musk\u2019s account, and at nearly 190 instances where Musk\u2019s own posts interacted with the Europeans.",
      "The AP also analyzed records of daily follower counts, using data from Social Blade, to measure any growth in the European accounts\u2019 audience that occurred in the wake of Musk\u2019s online interactions. This kind of analysis is no longer possible. In March, Social Blade removed X from its analytics, saying that X had increased its data access fees to prohibitive levels, making the platform harder to research.",
      "Among those included in AP\u2019s analysis are several people who have run into legal trouble in their own countries. An anti-immigrant agitator in the U.K., for example, was sentenced in October to 18 months in prison for violating a court order blocking him from making libelous allegations against a Syrian refugee. A German politician was convicted last year of knowingly using a Nazi slogan in a speech. An Italian vice premier was acquitted in December of illegally detaining 100 migrants aboard a humanitarian rescue ship.",
      "Others examined by AP were an influencer known as the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right;\u201d a German activist dubbed the \u201canti-Greta Thunberg\u201d now living in what amounts to political exile in Washington, D.C.; and two politicians who have advocated for the interests of Musk\u2019s companies as those firms seek to expand in Europe.",
      "AP\u2019s analysis shows how Musk is helping unite nationalists across borders in common cause to halt migration, overturn progressive policies and promote an absolutist vision of free speech. While his efforts have sparked backlash in some countries, Musk\u2019s promotion of a growing alliance of hard-right parties and individuals has helped rattle the foundation of a transatlantic bond that has guided U.S. and European relations for over eight decades.",
      "Engagement from Musk does not guarantee a surge in followers or page views. But AP found it can have a huge impact, especially on up-and-coming influencers. One account that began with around 120,000 followers when Musk took over Twitter in October 2022 topped 1.2 million by January of this year. Seven other European accounts saw six-figure increases in their follower counts over the same period.",
      "Most of the 11 accounts examined saw triple-digit percentage increases in their followers. Even some that grew more steadily on their own before Musk interacted with them saw their follower counts rise sharply after he began engaging with their posts. Similarly, on days Musk interacted with a post, its account saw its views soar \u2014 in most cases, accruing two to four times as many views, with a few seeing boosts 30 or 40 times their normal daily viewership.",
      "Musk is not the only factor influencing the growth of these accounts, of course, but their rising fortunes are a measure of how the platform has evolved under his leadership. When Musk acquired X, he pledged to turn it into a haven for free speech, declaring himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist.\u201d AP\u2019s analysis adds to growing evidence that instead of serving as a neutral forum for free speech, X amplifies Musk\u2019s speech.",
      "This shift has given him sweeping power to direct people\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme asymmetry in the way Musk is able to leverage and shape the platform,\u201d said Timothy Graham, an associate professor in digital media at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, who has studied data anomalies on X. \u201cThere\u2019s an unequivocal sense when you go onto the site that you\u2019re entering Musk\u2019s kingdom.\u201d",
      "Since he acquired Twitter in 2022, Musk has come to dominate the platform. His followers have more than doubled, to more than 220 million \u2014 growth so tremendous that it easily outpaced the other Top 10 accounts. Not even Taylor Swift has been able to keep up.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose followers grew by 21 million \u2014 or 25% \u2014 from October 2022 through January, clocked a distant second. Donald Trump\u2019s followers grew by 14%, or around 12 million, while Taylor Swift mustered a mere 3% growth, or 3 million new followers.",
      "None of the other Top 10 accounts have shown such consistent follower growth, month after month, AP found. The result is a further concentration of power for the world\u2019s richest man, who now commands the most popular account on a social media platform used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.",
      "Given the opacity of the algorithms that power X, it\u2019s hard to determine with certainty what array of factors might be driving such unusual \u2014 and unusually consistent \u2014 growth in Musk\u2019s account. But researchers who have analyzed data patterns on X argue that the platform\u2019s algorithm has, at times, been altered to amplify Musk\u2019s voice.",
      "How X promotes content is a growing point of contention in Europe. In January, the European Union expanded its investigation of X to assess how the platform pushes content to users and why some material goes viral. In February, French prosecutors opened a separate investigation into X over allegations that Musk changed the platform\u2019s algorithms to promote biased content.",
      "Musk\u2019s public attacks on left-leaning politicians, support for hard-right policies and loose handling of facts have prompted rebukes from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re.",
      "X did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk\u2019s dominance creates a strong incentive for people seeking to increase their clout \u2014 or their revenues, through the platform\u2019s monetization options \u2014 to exploit these network effects and try to get Musk to engage with their content.",
      "\u201cPeople know that he\u2019s gearing everything towards him,\u201d said Graham, the digital media scholar in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to get close to this person because he is the moneymaker.\u201d",
      "Germany\u2019s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, for example, has benefited from the Musk effect. AfD coleader Alice Weidel helped lead the party, which advocates for nationalist and anti-immigrant policies, to second place in German parliamentary elections in February.",
      "When Musk interacted with her account in the run-up to those elections, the average number of daily views she got rose from about 230,000 to 2.2 million.",
      "Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in May classified Weidel\u2019s party as a right-wing extremist organization, which would subject the AfD to greater surveillance. The party, which maintains that it\u2019s a victim of politically motivated defamation, promptly filed a lawsuit against the move, which Musk, along with top U.S. officials blasted as an attack on free speech. The designation has been suspended pending judicial review.",

      "The chat has gotten 16 million views. Musk also appeared at AfD rallies and endorsed the party in a German newspaper.",
      "AfD officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Naomi Seibt, a German climate skeptic, pinged Musk nearly 600 times between October 2022 and Jan. 2025. Musk finally engaged in June 2024, when he asked her to explain why the AfD is so controversial in Germany.",
      "Since then, Musk has replied to, quoted or tagged Seibt more than 50 times, and her followers have grown by more than 320,000 since Musk took over the platform. On days Musk interacted with Seibt, her posts, on average, got 2.6 times as many views.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally \u2018invade\u2019 Elon\u2019s algorithm,\u201d Seibt told AP. \u201cObviously Elon has a lot of influence and can help share a message even with those who are usually glued to the legacy media, particularly in Germany.\u201d",
      "Seibt said she\u2019s now living in the United States because she fears political persecution in Europe. \u201cWashington DC is the political heart of America and thus also the safest place for me to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI fear the German state wants me locked up.\u201d",
      "Musk has also boosted the influence of political insurgents in the U.K. Days before British national elections last July, Musk took to X to ask Nigel Farage, the leader of the populist Reform U.K. party: \u201cWhy does the media keep calling you far-right? What are your policies?\u201d",
      "Farage replied eagerly: \u201cBecause we believe in family, country and strong borders. Call me!\u201d",
      "Such interactions from Musk helped Farage more than triple his daily audience. Farage did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "In Spain, Rub\u00e9n Pulido, a columnist for a newspaper published by the populist Vox party\u2019s think tank, hit the jackpot in August, when Musk responded to two posts in which he argued that rescue boats operated by nongovernmental organizations effectively help smugglers move migrants to Europe. Pulido\u2019s visibility soared. On days Musk engaged with him, his account got nearly 300,000 views \u2014 roughly three times more than usual.",
      "When Musk didn\u2019t interact with Pulido\u2019s account, the results were just as clear. In January, he again inveighed against migrant rescues and sought to get Musk\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cHi @elonmusk! Speak up,\u201d he urged.",
      "Three weeks later, he tweeted: \u201cPerhaps @elonmusk might find this interesting.\u201d",
      "That post garnered just 5,128 views.",
      "Pulido did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "While Musk helped boost the accounts of such fringe parties and rising influencers, his interactions did not provide as stark a benefit to more established politicians, AP found. That was true for both Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose ruling Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders, an anti-Islamic firebrand who has been called the Dutch Donald Trump.",
      "Musk\u2019s interactions online have spilled into political endorsements, policy advocacy -- and money.",
      "X helps users monetize their accounts, through ad revenue sharing and paid subscription programs as well as direct fundraising links. That means a surge in attention on X can bring a surge in revenue.",
      "Tommy Robinson, a British anti-immigration agitator who was released from prison in May, after serving a reduced sentence of seven months for contempt of court, has a link to his fundraising page on his X profile. Interactions from Musk more than doubled Robinson\u2019s daily views, from around 380,000 to nearly 850,000. Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 could not be reached for comment",
      "Radio Genoa, an account reportedly investigated by Italian authorities last year for allegedly spreading hate speech about migrants, used X to publicize a call for a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for legal defense. Radio Genoa has pinged Musk dozens of times over the last three years, and for good reason: On days Musk engaged with him, the views on his account doubled. Radio Genoa\u2019s followers surged from less than 200,000 before Musk\u2019s engagement to over 1.2 million. Radio Genoa could not be reached for comment.",
      "Eva Vlaardingerbroek -- a conservative Dutch political commentator dubbed the \u201cshieldmaiden of the far-right\u201d whose account Musk has engaged with three dozen times -- uses X to solicit tips and has creator status, which allows her to charge subscription fees. So does Seibt, the German activist -- though she told AP her earnings from X aren\u2019t enough to sustain herself. Vlaardingerbroek did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Musk has also advocated for Matteo Salvini, vice premier of Italy and the leader of the hard-right, anti-migrant League party. On X, Musk\u2019s interactions boosted Salvini\u2019s daily visibility more than fourfold. Offline, Salvini has urged Italy to move ahead with controversial contracts for Starlink and pushed back against EU efforts to regulate content on X.",
      "Before Fidias Panayiotou \u2014 a 25-year-old social media influencer from Cyprus with no political experience \u2014 won a surprise seat as an independent in the European Parliament last year, he spent weeks camped outside Twitter and Space X headquarters in a highly publicized quest to hug the world\u2019s richest man. In January 2023, his wish came true. Their embrace went viral.",
      "Soon, Musk was interacting with Panayiotou\u2019s posts on a variety of subjects, expanding his typical audience on X by more than 3,000%.",
      "Since taking his seat, Panayiotou -- whose positions often also reflect the views of Cyprus\u2019 traditional leftist establishment -- has praised X on the floor of the European Parliament, pushed back against regulations that impact the platform, and credited Musk with sparking his call to fire 80% of EU bureaucrats.",
      "Musk, evidently, was pleased. \u201cVote for Fidias,\u201d he posted on X, an endorsement that was viewed more than 11.5 million times. \u201cHe is smart, super high energy and genuinely cares about you!\u201d",
      "In July, after AP asked for comment, Panayiotou posted a video to dispel any impression that he was Musk\u2019s puppet. \u201cI don\u2019t have any relationship with Elon Musk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken at all since we hugged, neither through messages, nor by phone, and I\u2019ve never invited him anywhere.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple shook off a thicket of tariffs and a botched entry into artificial intelligence to accelerate its revenue growth during its springtime quarter, but the trendsetting tech company still faces a bumpy road ahead that could lead to higher iPhone prices.",
      "The April-June results released Thursday came against a backdrop of adversity that has been raising worries about the trajectory of a longtime tech kingpin that expects to absorb a setback of nearly $2 billion from the tariffs that President Donald Trump has already imposed and others in the pipeline.",
      "Despite the doubts, Apple remains a moneymaking machine.",
      "The Cupertino, California, company earned $23.4 billion, or $1.57 per share, during its fiscal third quarter, a 9% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 10% from a year ago to $94 billion. The company\u2019s iPhone sales surged 13% from a year ago to $44.6 billion. In another positive development, Apple's business in China showed signs of snapping out of a prolonged malaise with a 4% bump in revenue from the same time last year.",
      "All those numbers were well above the analyst projections that steer investors, helping to boost Apple\u2019s recently slumping stock price by about 3% in extended trading. But the unexpectedly solid performance doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s smooth sailing ahead for Apple.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war targeting foreign-made products such as the iPhone and Apple\u2019s stumbling start in the pivotal transition to AI is causing investors to question if the company will remain at the tech forefront as the industry moves into a new era.",
      "Before Thursday\u2019s report came out, Apple\u2019s stock price had plunged by 17% so far this year to wipe out more than $600 billion in shareholder wealth and knock the company off its perch as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Meanwhile, the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia have surged 32% this year and the shares of AI pacesetter Microsoft have gained 27%, propelling the market value to $4 trillion.",
      "Even though Apple remains highly profitable, the tariffs that Trump has already imposed on China and other countries cost the company $800 million during the past quarter, and CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a conference call that the fees would exact an additional toll of $1.1 billion during the July-September period. The company also predicted its revenue for July-September period would increase at a slightly slower pace than the past quarter.",

      "Cook indicated the financial damage from the tariffs could have been much higher, telling analysts most of the components in iPhones and other Apple products are still shielded by temporary exemptions that the Trump administration granted most electronics in mid-April.",
      "Apple softened the blow of Trump\u2019s tariffs on products made outside the U.S. during the past quarter by shifting its production of iPhones from China to India. But the administration intends to impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, a move that could intensify the pressure on Apple to raise the prices on the next generation of iPhones expected to be released in September. Cook wasn't asked about the possibility of an iPhone increase during his Thursday remarks to analysts.",
      "Consumer fears about the tariffs driving up iPhone prices spurred an unusual buying spree of iPhones and Mac computers in the U.S. during early April, according to Cook. Apple estimated that spike accounted for roughly one percentage point of its 10% revenue increase in the past quarter, which translates into about $82 million in sales. Cook also credited an uptick in consumers upgrading to the latest model for helping Apple sell its 3 billionth iPhone since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "Trump has been pressuring Apple to make all its iPhones in the U.S., a move that analysts believe would take years to pull off and ultimately double or triple the roughly $1,000 average price of the device. But Cook told analysts Thursday that the company is pushing to increase its computer chip production in the U.S. as one way of avoiding tariffs. \u201cWe ultimately will do more in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Apple is still trying to fulfill the AI promises it made last year when it unveiled an array of new iPhone features built on the revolutionary technology, raising expectations that the shift would spur millions of people to upgrade their old devices. But Apple still hasn\u2019t delivered on an AI upgrade that was supposed to smarten up its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri, one of the main reasons underlying the lackluster growth of iPhone sales.",
      "\u201cWhile these numbers certainly buy Apple time, the fact is that investors \u2014 and consumers \u2014 remain laser-focused on AI innovation. And Apple still has a long way to go in this game,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court has upheld a jury verdict condemning Google's Android app store as an illegal monopoly, clearing the way for a federal judge to enforce a potentially disruptive shakeup that's designed to give consumers more choices.",
      "The unanimous ruling issued Thursday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals delivers a double-barreled legal blow for Google, which has been waylaid in three separate antitrust trials that resulted in different pillars of its internet empire being declared as domineering scofflaws monopolies since late 2023.",
      "The unsuccessful appeal represents a major victory for video game maker Epic Games, which launched a legal crusade targeting Google\u2019s Play Store for Android apps and Apple\u2019s iPhone app store nearly five years ago in an attempt to bypass exclusive payment processing systems that charged 15% to 30% commissions on in-app transactions.",
      "The jury's December 2023 rebuke of Google's app store for Android-powered smartphones began a cascade of setbacks that includes monopoly judgements against the company's ubiquitous search engine last year and the technology underlying its digital ad network earlier this year.",
      "Although not as lucrative as Google's search engine or ad system, the Play Store for Android apps has long been a gold mine that generated billions of dollars in annual revenue by taking a 15% to 30% cut from in-app transactions funneled through the company's own payment processing system.",
      "Following a month-long trial, a nine-person jury determined that Google had rigged its system to thwart alternative app stores from offering better deals to consumers and software developers. That verdict resulted in U.S. District Judge James Donato ordering Google to tear down digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition, triggering the company's appeal to overturn the jury's finding and void the judge's mandated shakeup.",
      "But a three-judge panel that heard Google's appeal in February rejected its lawyers' contention that Donato erred by allowing the case to be determined by a jury that deviated from the market definition outlined by another federal judge who mostly sided with Apple in Epic's case against the iPhone maker's app store.",
      "Epic's lawsuit \"was replete with evidence that Google\u2019s anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance, causing the Play Store to benefit from network effects,\" the judges wrote in the decision.",

      "Unless Google can extend the enforcement delay placed on Donato's order issued last October, the company will have to begin an overhaul that includes making the Play Store's entire library of more than 2 million Android apps available to would-be rivals and also help distribute the alternative options. Google has argued that the required revisions will raise privacy and security risks by exposing consumers to scam artists and hackers masquerading as legitimate app stores.",
      "But Epic's lawyers have ridiculed Google's warnings about the changes as scare tactics in a desperate attempt to protect the fortunes of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc.",
      "Although Epic fell short in its attempt to have the iPhone's app store declared a monopoly, that case resulted in a judge issuing an order that required Apple to surrender exclusive control over the payment processing of in-app transactions and allow links to alternative systems without collecting a commission.",
      "Besides being hit with Donato's order, Google still faces further trouble ahead that could leave an even bigger dent in its finances.",
      "As part of the effort to address Google\u2019s illegal monopoly in search, a federal judge is weighing a proposal by the U.S. Justice Department that would require the sale of its Chrome web browser and ban the multibillion dollar deals that company has been making with Apple and others to lock-in its search engine as the main gateway to the internet.",
      "Google is also facing a proposed breakup of its advertising technology as part of the countermeasures to its monopoly in that business. A trial on that proposal is scheduled to begin in September.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A 12-year-old boy died from a brain-eating amoeba two weeks after a holiday weekend on a popular South Carolina lake.",
      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",
      "It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue. Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but almost all are fatal.",
      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "He got sick several days later and died on July 18.",
      "His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.",
      "Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn\u2019t closed and no water testing was performed.",

      "Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.",
      "\u201cMy son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,\u201d Carr said.",
      "Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies",
      "The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That\u2019s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.",
      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",

Yes, you read right, your passwords will be DELETED this Friday.",
      "Why? Because Microsoft is moving its signature sign-in app to a digital authentication method touted by security experts as an easier and more secure way to log in: passkeys.",
      "\u201cLast year (2024), we observed a staggering 7,000 password attacks per second (more than double the rate from 2023),\" Microsoft wrote in a blog post. \"Although passwords have been around for centuries, we hope their reign over our online world is ending.\u201d",
      "Authenticator has been a staple in providing multi-factor authentication, one-time passwords and biometric logins for services and some websites.

      "Note that not all websites and applications have adopted passkeys yet, so many places still rely on passwords.",
      "If you haven't yet moved to a different password manager system or set up your passkeys, we're here to help.",
      "Passkeys do away with complex 14 character passwords because you never need to see them. Instead you are using existing biometrics like your face or fingerprints, digital patterns or PINs to access your accounts.",
      "Passkeys are made up of two parts of a code that only makes sense when they\u2019re combined, kind of like a digital key and padlock. You keep half of the encrypted code, typically stored either in the cloud with a compatible verification app \u2014 including Authenticator \u2014 or on a physical security dongle. The other half is stored on the participating apps, services or accounts you want to access.",
      "The bad news? You do have to set up individual passkeys for each service or application that accepts them. Keeping track of where you can use them versus traditional passwords can be challenging.",
      "If you've opened Authenticator in the last few months, you likely were prompted to set up a passkey through a guided experience.",
      "If you didn't receive such a prompt, you can set up a new passkey by opening the authenticator app on your device. Find and tap on your account, then select \u201cset up a passkey\u201d option. Follow the app's instructions.",

      "When big infrastructure projects spring up, one crucial law \u2014 the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 has for decades been a key way the government has required powerful industry interests to consider the environment and the public\u2019s voice",
      "When President Donald Trump rolled out a plan to boost artificial intelligence and data centers, a key goal was wiping away barriers to rapid growth.",
      "And that meant taking aim at the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 a 55-year-old, bedrock law aimed at protecting the environment through a process that requires agencies to consider a project's possible impacts and allows the public to be heard before a project is approved. Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",
      "The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, as it's commonly known, to streamline environmental reviews and permitting for data centers and related infrastructure. Republicans and business interests have long criticized NEPA for what they see as unreasonable slowing of development, and Trump\u2019s plan would give \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d to data centers for \u201cmaximum efficiency\u201d in permitting.",
      "A spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said the administration is \u201cfocused on driving meaningful NEPA reform to reduce the delays in federal permitting, unleashing the ability for America to strengthen its AI and manufacturing leadership.\"",
      "Trump's administration has been weakening the law for months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,\u201d said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.",
      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "\"It's been a rough eight months for NEPA,\u201d said Dinah Bear, a former general counsel at the Council on Environmental Quality under both Democratic and Republican presidents.",
      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "O\u2019Brien, who later worked at the Grand Canyon Trust, also co-chaired a working group that weighed in on a 2012 Forest Service proposal, finalized in 2016, for aspen restoration on Monroe Mountain in Utah. Hunters, landowners, loggers and ranchers all had different opinions on how the restoration should be handled. She said NEPA\u2019s requirement to get the public involved made for better research and a better plan.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the laws that\u2019s the most often used by the public without the public being aware,\u201d said Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice. \u201cNEPA has long been the one opportunity for communities and impacted stakeholders and local governments to weigh in.\u201d",
      "Schima said rolling back the power of NEPA threatens the scientific integrity of examining projects' full impacts.",
      "\u201cDecisions are going to be less informed by scientific studies, and that is one of the major concerns here,'' he said.",
      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",

      "A shooting at a Montana bar Friday left four people dead, and law enforcement officers were searching for a suspect described by his niece as a former U.S. soldier who struggled to get help for mental health problems.",
      "Officers searched a mountainous area west of the small town of Anaconda for the 45-year-old suspect, Michael Paul Brown. He lived next door to the site of the 10:30 a.m. shooting at the Owl Bar, according to public records and bar owner David Gwerder.",
      "The bartender and three patrons were killed, said Gwerder, who was not there at the time. He believed the four victims were the only ones present during the shooting, and was not aware of any prior conflicts between them and Brown.",
      "\"He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,\u201d Gwerder said. \u201cHe didn't have any running dispute with any of them. I just think he snapped.\u201d",
      "Brown's home was cleared by a SWAT team and he was last seen in the Stump Town area, just west of Anaconda, authorities said.",
      "More than a dozen officers from local and state police converged on that area, locking it down so no one was allowed in or out. A helicopter also hovered over a nearby mountainside as officers moved among the trees, said Randy Clark, a retired police officer who lives there.",
      "Brown was believed to be armed, the Montana Highway Patrol said in a statement.",
      "Brown served in the U.S. Army as an armor crewman from 2001 to 2005 and deployed to Iraq from early 2004 until March 2005, according to Lt. Col. Ruth Castro, an Army spokesperson. Brown was in the Montana National Guard from 2006 to March 2009, Castro said. He left military service in the rank of sergeant.",

      "PHILADELPHIA, Miss. -- Each summer, hundreds of brightly colored cabins come to life with the sound of children playing and smells of Southern comfort food in what's known as Mississippi's \u201cgiant house party,\u201d the Neshoba County Fair.",
      "The fair touts itself as the largest campground fair in the country, where attendees cram into more than 500 two-and-three story wood cabins for eight days every year. The larger cabins can sleep upwards of 30 people, sometimes in the same room.",
      "\u201cIt's like having two Christmases a year,\u201d said Mike Hardy, who attends the fair just about every year and shared a cabin this year with 20 members of his family, from infants to grandparents.",
      "For Hardy, who lives more than 300 miles (500 kilometers) away in Nashville, Tennessee, the fair is one of the only times he visits his hometown. He calls it a high school, college and family reunion all wrapped into one.",
      "\u201cI wouldn't miss it for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just always been a big part of our lives.\u201d",
      "Hardy inherited the cabin from his father, who bought it in the late 1960s. It's located in what's known as \u2018watermelon alley,' one of several neighborhoods that divide up the community, which feels like a mix between a candy-colored frontier town and an amusement park. His children grew up going there. The pictures they drew on hot summer days still hang on the walls, joined now by their own children's artwork.",

      "Horse-race watching at the nearby race track and card playing are among Hardy family's favorite activities during the fair. They take their kids to the carnival rides and cook large family meals. On their way to the track, they walk through Founders Square, the oldest section of cabins with a pavilion used for dances and political speeches. It's where Ronald Reagan gave his famous states' rights speech in 1980 while running for president.",

      "The communal atmosphere extends to mealtime. Although only about 20 people stay in their cabin, Salter's family often feeds 50 or 60 people a day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an inexpensive hobby,\u201d he joked, \u201cbut it\u2019s a great time with people you only see, you know, during the fair.\"",
      "The fair, Salter said, also feels like a reunion with loved ones who are no longer living. He imagines that the spirits of his twin sister, first wife and parents like to \u201cknock around\u201d the campground where they made so many memories.",
      "\u201cIt may be a figment of a fertile imagination \u2014 I\u2019m sure it is \u2014 but I feel it,\u201d he said.",

      "And the number of executions is expected to keep climbing. Nine more people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025.",
      "After the Supreme Court lifted its ban on capital punishment in the \u201970s, executions steadily increased, peaking in 1999 at 98 deaths. Since then, they had been dropping \u2014 in part due to legal battles, a shortage of lethal injection drugs, and declining public support for capital punishment, which has prompted a majority of states to either pause or abolish it altogether.",
      "The ratcheting up after this yearslong decline comes as Republican President Donald Trump has urged prosecutors to aggressively seek the death penalty and as some GOP-controlled state legislatures have pushed to expand the category of crimes punishable by death and the methods used to carry out executions.",
      "John Blume, director of the Cornell Death Penalty Project, says the uptick in executions doesn\u2019t appear to be linked to a change in public support for the death penalty or an increase in the rate of death sentences, but is rather a function of the discretion of state governors.",

      "In 2024, DeSantis signed one death warrant. From 2020-2022, Florida didn\u2019t carry out a single execution. In 2023, DeSantis oversaw six \u2014 the highest number during his time in office until this year. 2023 was also the year the governor challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.",
      "There are a number of reasons why the rate of executions may vary from one administration to the next, said Mark Schlakman, an attorney and Florida State University professor who advised then-governor Lawton Chiles on the death penalty.",
      "The availability of staff resources, the tempo of lengthy legal appeals, and court challenges against the death penalty itself can all play a role, Schlakman said, as well as a governor\u2019s \u201csensibilities.\u201d",
      "One execution after another, opponents of the death penalty hold vigils in the Florida capitol, outside the governor's mansion, and near the state prison that houses the death chamber, as people of faith across the state pray for mercy, healing and justice.",
      "Suzanne Printy, a volunteer with the group Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty, has hand-delivered thousands of petitions to DeSantis' office, but says they seem to have no effect.",
      "Recently, DeSantis signed death warrants for two more men scheduled to die later this month.",
      "Still, Printy keeps praying.",

      "A video showing the violent arrest of a Black college student in Florida has sparked calls for drivers to use cameras that show a view from inside their car",
      "A video that captured the brutal arrest of a Black college student pulled from his car and beaten by officers in Florida has led to an investigation and calls for motorists to consider protecting themselves by placing a camera inside their vehicles.",
      "William McNeil Jr. captured his February traffic stop on his cellphone camera, which was mounted above his dashboard. It offered a unique view, providing the only clear footage of the violence by officers, including punches to his head that can't clearly be seen in officer body camera footage released by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.",
      "Since McNeil had the foresight to record the encounter from inside the vehicle, \u201cwe got to see firsthand and hear firsthand and put it all in context what driving while Black is in America,\u201d said civil rights attorney Ben Crump, one of several lawyers advising McNeil.",
      "\u201cAll the young people should be recording these interactions with law enforcement,\" Crump said. Because what it tells us, just like with George Floyd, if we don\u2019t record the video, we can see what they put in the police report with George Floyd before they realized the video existed.\u201d",
      "McNeil was pulled over that day because officers said his headlights should have been on due to bad weather, his lawyers said. His camera shows him asking the officers what he did wrong. Seconds later, an officer smashes his window, strikes him as he sat in the driver\u2019s seat and then pulls him from the car and punches him in the head. After being knocked to the ground, McNeil was punched six more times in his right thigh, a police report states.",
      "The incident reports don't describe the officer punching McNeil in the head. The officer, who pulled McNeil over and then struck him, described the force this way in his report: \u201cPhysical force was applied to the suspect and he was taken to the ground.\u201d",
      "But after McNeil posted his video online last month and it went viral, the sheriff's office launched an internal investigation, which is ongoing. A sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson declined to comment about the case this week, citing pending litigation, though no lawsuit has been filed over the arrest.",
      "McNeil said the ordeal left him traumatized, with a brain injury, a broken tooth and several stiches in his lip. His attorneys accused the sheriff's office of trying to cover up what really happened.",
      "\u201cOn Feb. 19, 2025, Americans saw what America is,\u201d said another of McNeil\u2019s lawyers, Harry Daniels. \u201cWe saw injustice. You saw abuse of police power. But most importantly we saw a young man that had a temperament to control himself in the face of brutality.\u201d",
      "The traffic stop, he said, was not only racially motivated but \u201cit was unlawful, and everything that stemmed from that stop was unlawful.\"",
      "McNeil is hardly the first Black motorist to record video during a traffic stop that turned violent \u2014 Philando Castile's girlfriend livestreamed the bloody aftermath of his death during a 2016 traffic stop near Minneapolis. But McNeil's arrest serves as a reminder of how cellphone video can show a different version of events than what is described in police reports, his lawyers said.",
      "Christopher Mercado, who retired as a lieutenant from the New York Police Department, agreed with McNeil's legal team's suggestion that drivers should record their police interactions and that a camera mounted inside a driver's car could offer a unique point of view.",
      "\"Use technology to your advantage,\" said Mercado, an adjunct assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious about it. It's actually a smart thing in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Rod Brunson, chairman of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, said he thinks it's a good idea for citizens to film encounters with police \u2014 as long as doing so doesn't make the situation worse.",

      "\u201cI think that's a form of protection \u2014 it's safeguarding them against false claims of criminal behavior or interfering with officers, etc.,\u201d Brunson said.",
      "Although the sheriff's office declined to speak to The Associated Press this week, Sheriff T.K. Waters has spoken publicly about McNeil's arrest since video of the encounter went viral. He pushed back against some of the allegations made by McNeil's lawyers, noting that McNeil was told more than a half-dozen times to exit the vehicle.",
      "At a news conference last month, Waters also highlighted images of a knife in McNeil's car. The officer who punched him claimed in his police report that McNeil reached toward the floor of the car, where deputies later found the knife.",
      "Crump, though, said McNeil's video shows that he \u201cnever reaches for anything,\u201d and a second officer wrote in his report that McNeil kept his hands up as the other officer smashed the car window.",
      "A camera inside a motorist's vehicle could make up for some shortcomings of police bodycams, which can have a narrow field of view that becomes more limited the closer an officer gets to the person being filmed, Mercado said.",
      "However, after the police murder of Floyd, some states and cities debated how and when citizens should be able to capture video of police. The Constitution guarantees the right to record police in public, but a point of contention in some states has been whether a civilian's recording might interfere with the ability of officers to do their job. In Louisiana, for example, a new law makes it a crime to approach within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of a police officer in certain situations.",
      "Waters acknowledged those limitations at a news conference last year, as he narrated video of a wild brawl between officers and a fan in the stands at EverBank Stadium during a football game last year between the universities of Georgia and Florida.",
      "The sheriff showed the officers' bodycam videos during the start of the confrontation near the top of the stadium. But when the officers subdued the suspect and were pressing against him, the bodycam footage didn't capture much, so the sheriff switched to stadium security video shot from a longer distance away.",
      "In McNeil's case, the bodycam video didn't clearly capture the punches thrown. If it had, the case would have been investigated right away, the sheriff said.",
      "For the past 20 years, Brunson has been interviewing young Black men in several U.S. cities about their encounters with law enforcement. When he first began submitting research papers for academic review, many readers didn't believe the men's stories of being brutalized by officers.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in a civil society don't expect to be treated this way by the police. For them, their police interactions are mostly pleasant, mostly cordial,\" Brunson said.",
      "\u201cSo it's hard for people who don\u2019t have a tenuous relationship with the police to fathom that something like this happens,\u201d he said. \"And that\u2019s where video does play a big part because people can't deny what they see.\u201d",

Meanwhile, many asylum-seekers who have regular check-in appointments are being arrested in the hallways outside courtrooms as the White House works toward its promise of mass deportations.",

      "PERRY, N.Y. -- As a student in western New York's rural Wyoming County, Briar Townes honed an artistic streak that he hopes to make a living from one day. In high school, he clicked with a college-level drawing and painting class.",
      "But despite the college credits he earned, college isn't part of his plan.",
      "Since graduating from high school in June, he has been overseeing an art camp at the county's Arts Council. If that doesn't turn into a permanent job, there is work at Creative Food Ingredients, known as the \u201ccookie factory\u201d for the way it makes the town smell like baking cookies, or at local factories like American Classic Outfitters, which designs and sews athletic uniforms.",
      "\u201cMy stress is picking an option, not finding an option,\u201d he said.",
      "Even though rural students graduate from high school at higher rates than their peers in cities and suburbs, fewer of them go on to college.",
      "Many rural school districts, including the one in Perry that Townes attends, have begun offering college-level courses and working to remove academic and financial obstacles to higher education, with some success. But college doesn't hold the same appeal for students in rural areas where they often would need to travel farther for school, parents have less college experience themselves, and some of the loudest political voices are skeptical of the need for higher education.",
      "College enrollment for rural students has remained largely flat in recent years, despite the district-level efforts and stepped-up recruitment by many universities. About 55% of rural U.S. high school students who graduated in 2023 enrolled in college, according to National Clearinghouse Research Center data. That's compared to 64% of suburban graduates and 59% of urban graduates.",
      "College can make a huge difference in earning potential. An American man with a bachelor\u2019s degree earns an estimated $900,000 more over his lifetime than a peer with a high school diploma, research by the Social Security Administration has found. For women, the difference is about $630,000.",
      "A lack of a college degree is no obstacle to opportunity in places such as Wyoming County, where people like to say there are more cows than people. The dairy farms, potato fields and maple sugar houses are a source of identity and jobs for the county just east of Buffalo.",
      "\u201cCollege has never really been, I don\u2019t know, a necessity or problem in my family,\u201d said Townes, the middle of three children whose father has a tattoo shop in Perry.",
      "At Perry High School, Superintendent Daryl McLaughlin said the district takes cues from students like Townes, their families and the community, supplementing college offerings with programs geared toward career and technical fields such as the building trades. He said he is as happy to provide reference checks for employers and the military as he is to write recommendations for college applications.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re letting our students know these institutions, whether it is a college or whether employers, they\u2019re competing for you,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is now setting them up for success so that they can take the greatest advantage of that competition, ultimately, to improve their quality of life.\u201d",
      "Still, college enrollment in the district has exceeded the national average in recent years, going from 60% of the class of 2022\u2019s 55 graduates to 67% of 2024's and 56% of 2025's graduates. The district points to a decision to direct federal pandemic relief money toward covering tuition for students in its Accelerated College Enrollment program \u2014 a partnership with Genesee Community College. When the federal money ran out, the district paid to keep it going.",
      "\u201cThis is a program that\u2019s been in our community for quite some time, and it\u2019s a program our community supports,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "About 15% of rural U.S. high school students were enrolled in college classes in January 2025 through such dual enrollment arrangements, a slightly lower rate than urban and suburban students, an Education Department survey found.",
      "Rural access to dual enrollment is a growing area of focus as advocates seek to close gaps in access to higher education. The College in High School Alliance this year announced funding for seven states to develop policy to expand programs for rural students.",

      "Paper mills and power plants provide opportunities for a middle class life in the county, where the cost of living is low. But Theobold tells students the goal of higher education \u201cis to go off and learn more about not only the world, but also about yourself.\u201d",

Many students visit college campuses through Camp Osprey, a University of North Florida program that helps students experience college dorms and dining halls.",
      "In upstate New York, high school junior Devon Wells grew up on his family farm in Perry but doesn't see his future there.

      "The fallout from a failed Georgia lender doesn't just include small investors but goes right to the top of Republican politics in Georgia and Alabama",
      "CEDARTOWN, Ga. -- A federal receiver is on the hunt to recover $140 million lost in an alleged Ponzi scheme that benefited some Republicans in the top ranks of their party in Georgia and Alabama. He's looking to claw back funds, including almost 1,000 political donations totaling more than $1 million, that often backed far-right Republican insurgents.",
      "Some of these same politicians say they too lost money, but others left holding the bag for First Liberty Building & Loan are rank-and-file conservatives, swayed by talk show pundits who promoted it as an opportunity for Christians and \u201cAmerica First MAGA patriots.\u201d",
      "\u201cI worked my whole life to build up savings and have a little bit of retirement so I could just live comfortably,\u201d said Michael Tinney, a 59-year-old real estate broker from Cedartown, Georgia. Tinney said he deposited $600,000 after hearing First Liberty pitched on shows hosted by conservatives including Erick Erickson, Hugh Hewitt and Charlie Kirk.",
      "First Liberty had promised returns up to 16% by making high-interest loans to businesses. Brant Frost IV, an evangelical powerbroker, touted \u201cWall Street returns for Main Street investors.\u201d But he skimmed $17 million for himself, his relatives and their affiliated companies, and loaned millions more that borrowers never repaid, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit claims.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got retired teachers, we\u2019ve got retired businessmen, we\u2019ve got retired ministers who have been part of this program as well as doctors, lawyers, everyone else you can imagine,\u201d his son, Brant Frost V, said in 2024. Tinney said the younger Frost drove to his office to secure his investment.",
      "According to a July 21 report from court-appointed receiver S. Gregory Hays, assets now include just $1.2 million in cash along with some Frost family real estate.",
      "Hays told The Associated Press it's too early to estimate how much money is recoverable, but he's moving to foreclose on collateral pledged by borrowers who defaulted, including a failed South Carolina factory. Hays also seized and plans to auction Brant Frost IV's Aston Martin sports car. A social media post celebrating that 2022 purchase is particularly scorned by angry investors.",
      "But Hays doubts he can get everything back.",
      "\u201cThe investors are going to have substantial losses here,\u201d he said.",
      "Georgia and Alabama also are investigating. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urged politicians to return campaign cash. Hays said he's already received $110,000, plus a returned $20,000 charitable donation.",
      "Frost said on July 11 that he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d and would \u201cspend the rest of my life trying to repay as much as I can to the many people I misled and let down.\u201d",
      "But no criminal charges have been announced, and some Frost relatives retain influential positions in the Georgia Republican Party, whose chairman, Josh McKoon, has had the Frosts' political and financial support. McKoon said the party returned nearly $37,000 in Frost donations and he\u2019s \u201cprofoundly saddened that members of our conservative movement\u201d lost money.",
      "Campaign disclosures show First Liberty, the Frosts and associated companies contributed widely to Republican causes, including more than $700,000 in Georgia, $150,000 in Alabama and nearly $140,000 in Maine, where the Frosts spent $230,000 over multiple years renting a Kennebunkport vacation home.",
      "Georgia donations included $1,000 to former party chairman David Shafer\u2019s unsuccessful 2018 lieutenant governor campaign, and tens of thousands to the state party. Shafer pushed efforts to overturn President Donald Trump's 2020 defeat in Georgia \u2014 leading to an indictment \u2014 now stalled on pretrial appeal \u2014 against Shafer, Trump and others.",
      "A company run by Shafer \u2014 Springwood Capital \u2014 says in a July 10 lawsuit that it lost $200,000 invested in First Liberty. Its attorney, Brent Herrin, said the company is \u201cone of hundreds of defrauded investors.\u201d Herrin declined to confirm Shafer owns the company, but financial disclosures show Shafer in 2017 owned at least part of Springwood Capital's parent company. McKoon, who received $4,500 in Frost donations, handled Springwood Capital's incorporation papers. McKoon said he didn't lose any money.",

      "WASHINGTON -- For all of President Donald Trump\u2019s promises of an economic \u201cgolden age,\u201d a spate of weak indicators this week told a potentially worrisome story as the impacts of his policies are coming into focus.",
      "Job gains are dwindling. Inflation is ticking upward. Growth has slowed compared to last year.",
      "More than six months into his term, Trump\u2019s blitz of tariff hikes and his new tax and spending bill have remodeled America\u2019s trading, manufacturing, energy and tax systems to his own liking. He\u2019s eager to take credit for any wins that might occur and is hunting for someone else to blame if the financial situation starts to totter.",
      "But as of now, this is not the boom the Republican president promised, and his ability to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, for any economic challenges has faded as the world economy hangs on his every word and social media post.",
      "When Friday\u2019s jobs report turned out to be decidedly bleak, Trump ignored the warnings in the data and fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly jobs figures.",
      "\u201cImportant numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can\u2019t be manipulated for political purposes,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social, without offering evidence for his claim. \u201cThe Economy is BOOMING.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s possible that the disappointing numbers are growing pains from the rapid transformation caused by Trump and that stronger growth will return \u2014 or they may be a preview of even more disruption to come.",
      "Trump's aggressive use of tariffs, executive actions, spending cuts and tax code changes carries significant political risk if he is unable to deliver middle-class prosperity. The effects of his new tariffs are still several months away from rippling through the economy, right as many Trump allies in Congress will be campaigning in the midterm elections.",
      "\u201cConsidering how early we are in his term, Trump\u2019s had an unusually big impact on the economy already,\u201d said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist at Firehouse Strategies. \u201cThe full inflationary impact of the tariffs won\u2019t be felt until 2026. Unfortunately for Republicans, that\u2019s also an election year.\u201d",
      "The White House portrayed the blitz of trade frameworks leading up to Thursday's tariff announcement as proof of his negotiating prowess. The European Union, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia and other nations that the White House declined to name agreed that the U.S. could increase its tariffs on their goods without doing the same to American products. Trump simply set rates on other countries that lacked settlements.",
      "The costs of those tariffs \u2014 taxes paid on imports to the U.S. \u2014 will be most felt by many Americans in the form of higher prices, but to what extent remains uncertain.",
      "\u201cFor the White House and their allies, a key part of managing the expectations and politics of the Trump economy is maintaining vigilance when it comes to public perceptions,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist.",
      "Just 38% of adults approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, according to a July poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That\u2019s down from the end of Trump\u2019s first term when half of adults approved of his economic leadership.",
      "The White House paints a rosier image, seeing the economy emerging from a period of uncertainty after Trump\u2019s restructuring and repeating the economic gains seen in his first term before the pandemic struck.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is implementing the very same policy mix of deregulation, fairer trade, and pro-growth tax cuts at an even bigger scale \u2013 as these policies take effect, the best is yet to come,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said.",

      "A three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing Monday afternoon at which the federal government asked the court to overturn a temporary restraining order issued July 12 by Judge Maame E. Frimpong, arguing it hindered their enforcement of immigration law.",
      "Immigrant advocacy groups filed suit last month accusing President Donald Trump\u2019s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. The lawsuit included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens as plaintiffs.",

She wrote the government cannot use factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone\u2019s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion to detain someone.",
      "The Los Angeles region has been a battleground with the Trump administration over its aggressive immigration strategy that spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guards and Marines for several weeks.

      "A long list of things went wrong in January and contributed to the collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines jet over Washington, D",
      "Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people.",
      "The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented.",
      "At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns.",
      "\u201cAre you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?\u201d she said. \u201cFix it. Do better.\u201d",
      "Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.",
      "Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying:",
      "The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) \u2014 well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route \u2014 when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.",
      "The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit.",
      "An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions.",
      "Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off.",
      "But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling.",
      "Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB\u2019s final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash.",
      "\u201cI think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,\u201d aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said.",
      "Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan.",

      "Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan\u2019s secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights.",
      "Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route.",
      "Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA\u2019s air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan \u201cwere really dependent upon the use of visual separation\u201d to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just \u201cmake it work.\u201d They sometimes used \u201csqueeze plays\u201d to land planes with minimal separation.",
      "On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.",
      "The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane\u2019s pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late.",
      "An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said \u201chelicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.\u201d",
      "Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns.",
      "The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision,",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said \u201cevery sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.\u201d But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.",
      "\u201cWhat you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cBut you guys are pointing out, \u2018Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer behind such standards like \"Don't Touch Me,\" has died. She was 85.",
      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",
      "Dolly Parton was one of several country music luminaries paying her tribute on Friday, saying she met Seely when they were both young and starting out in Nashville.",
      "\"She was one of my dearest friends,\" Parton said on her social media accounts. \"I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.\"",
      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:38:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",

      "\"Amy Bradley is Missing,\" directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, explores the unsolved case that has puzzled investigators for nearly three decades. Bradley disappeared from her family's cruise, leaving behind numerous theories but few concrete answers.",
      "\"The Amy Bradley story is something if you've been around the genre, you know about it,\" Mark said. \"It's one of the most baffling mysteries of a disappearance case.\"",

Investigators have noted that the sliding door to her balcony was found ajar, raising questions about whether she left voluntarily or was taken against her will.",

      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump's administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don't have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies' lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician, associate dean for public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breastfeeding supplies and baby clothes, but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities\u00a0near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She's heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade on Friday.",
      "\"For so long, moms have been vilified and not supported,\" Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\"So this time around, I didn't have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\" she said.",
      "Celeste Lord-Timlin, a Flint resident and program participant, attended the baby parade with her husband and 13-month-old daughter by her side. She said the deposits helped her pay for graduate school while she was pregnant.",
      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \"no-brainer\" way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\"We've been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\" he said. \"And this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\"",
      "A new movement of pro-natalist political figures, including Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and other members of Trump's periphery, have harped on the country's declining birth rate.",
      "But a recent Associated Press-NORC poll found that most Americans want the government to focus on the high costs of child care, not just the number of babies being born here.",
      "Under Trump's tax and spending bill that Congress passed in July, the child tax credit is boosted from $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200. But millions of families at lower income levels will not get the full credit.",
      "The bill will also create a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "That's not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\"We don't have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\" Hanna said. \"No wonder people aren't having children and our birth rates are going down.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate.

    "summary": "Berkshire Hathaway's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it has to record the current value of its massive investment portfolio.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett's\u00a0company reported less than half as much profit in the second quarter as it took a $3.76 billion writedown on the value of its stake in\u00a0Kraft Heinz, as that iconic food producer considers largely undoing the merger that Berkshire Hathaway helped bankroll.",
      "Berkshire said it earned $12.37 billion, or $8,601 per Class A share, during the quarter. That's down from $30.248 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, a year ago, because it recorded a much smaller paper investment gain this year.",
      "Berkshire's earnings can swing wildly from quarter to quarter because it must record the current value of its massive investment portfolio, even though it doesn't sell most of the stocks. That's why Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings, which exclude those investment gains. Although last year Berkshire did surprised shareholders by\u00a0selling off\u00a0a huge chunk of its Apple stake, which inflated the investment gains then.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings were only down slightly at $11.16 billion, or $7,759.58 per Class A share. That compares with $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, a year ago. Most of Berkshire's myriad assortment of companies \u2014 major insurers like Geico, BNSF railroad, a group of utilities and a collection of manufacturing and retail businesses \u2014 generally performed well despite the uncertainty about the economy and President Trump's tariffs.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research expected Berkshire to report earnings per Class A share of $7,508.10, so the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's results were ahead of that.",
      "Berkshire owns more than 27% of Kraft Heinz' stock and, for years, it has had representatives on the company's board. Buffett has said previously that he believes the company's iconic brands will do well over time, but in hindsight, he overpaid for the investment and underestimated the challenges branded foods face from retailers and the growth of private label products.",
      "This spring, Berkshire's representatives resigned from the Kraft Heinz board shortly before the company announced it is exploring strategic options that may include spinning off a large part of its portfolio of brands.",
      "Over the years since Berkshire helped Kraft buy Heinz in 2015, the company has been hurt by changing consumer tastes and a shift toward healthier options than Kraft's core collection of processed foods.",
      "Buffett's is still sitting on a massive pile of $344.1 billion in cash, although the company's reserves dipped slightly from the $347.7 billion cash it was holding at the end of the first quarter. Buffett told shareholders in May he just isn't finding any attractive deals for companies he understands.",
      "Buffett surprised shareholders at the annual meeting when he announced that he plans to\u00a0give up the CEO title\u00a0at the end of the year and hand over operations to\u00a0Vice Chairman Greg Abel, but Buffett will remain Chairman.",
      "Berkshire shareholders might be disappointed that the company didn't repurchase any of its shares this quarter, even though the price has fallen more than 12% since just before Buffett announced his retirement.",
      "Many investors are watching Berkshire's BNSF closely after\u00a0rival Union Pacific announced\u00a0a plan to buy Norfolk Southern earlier this week to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. The speculation is that BNSF needs to pursue a merger with Eastern Rail CSX to be able to compete.",
      "But CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it isn't Buffett's style to jump into a deal just because the market thinks he should. Over the decades, he has built Berkshire by finding strong companies selling for less than they are worth. CSX is trading near its 52-week high at $35.01 amid all the deal speculation.",
      "\"He wants to do it because he found an undervalued franchise -- not because the market says you need to do a deal,\" Seifert said. \"I think one of the reasons why that cash hasn't been deployed is that valuations run through the Berkshire M-and-A model tend to be too rich. But if there's a logical case to be made they'll accept it.\"",
      "And BNSF appears to be doing fine right now on its own. The railroad recorded a 19% jump in its operating profit this quarter at $1.47 billion as it cut costs and delivered about 1% more shipments.",

      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",

      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",

      "Hiring was weaker\u00a0than expected by economists, who had forecast payroll gains of 115,000 jobs last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.2%, up from 4.1% in June.",
      "The Labor Department also sharply revised job growth for May and June down by a combined 258,000, a sign that hiring earlier this year was weaker than previously estimated.",
      "Factoring in the downward revisions, the three-month average employment gain from May to June was 35,000, compared to an average of 123,000 from January to April.",
      "\"Sadly, employment appears set for a further summer slowdown as firms, facing renewed cost volatility from escalating trade tensions, remain focused on managing labor costs through reduced hiring, performance-based layoffs, restrained wage growth and lower entry-level wages,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said in a report. \"We anticipate job creation will weaken further, remaining below trend in the coming months, with the unemployment rate likely rising toward 4.8% by early 2026.\"",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest gains in July, adding 55,000 jobs. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 12,000 cuts in July.",
      "What it means",
      "Some market analysts said the subpar job growth in July suggests that stepped-up U.S. tariffs on the country's economic partners are weighing on the labor market. President Trump issued an executive order late Thursday that imposes tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Today's Jobs report is unambiguously soft and a reflection of the trade and tariff impact on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"Both the actual report and the big negative revisions are more evidence that the trade policy will slow growth.\"",
      "Beyond the ups and down of the job market, meanwhile, many Americans are struggling in an economy bifurcated between rich and poor.",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" Beth Hammack, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady in an interview. \"At the bottom end of the spectrum, what I hear when I'm out in the district is I hear a lot of struggle. I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef. They're buying hot dogs.\"",
      "The latest job numbers could spur Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next meeting in September, according to economists. The central bank opted this week to\u00a0hold its benchmark rate steady. President Trump has pushed for a rate cut, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that policymakers remain cautious about lowering rates until the impact of tariffs on the economy is clear.",
      "\"With this morning's payroll miss \u2014 and the downward revisions that came with it \u2014 the Fed will again need to balance a slowing job market with inflation which isn't slowing fast enough,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "According to CME FedWatch, investors see a roughly 77% probability of a Fed cut at the Fed's Sept. 16-17 meeting.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla was found partly liable in a wrongful death case involving the electric vehicle company's Autopilot system, with a jury awarding the plaintiffs $200 million in punitive damages plus additional money in compensatory damages.",
      "The case, which took place in a Miami courtroom over the last couple of weeks, centered on whether defects in Tesla's self-driving technology ultimately contributed to the death of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon in 2019.",
      "Along with the $200 million in punitive damages, Tesla was also ordered to pay around $43 million in compensatory damages directly to the plaintiffs.",
      "Leon was killed when a man driving a Model S Tesla equipped with Tesla's Autopilot technology plowed through a T-shaped intersection and struck her and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo. Angulo survived but was gravely injured.",
      "The federal jury held that Tesla bore significant responsibility in the incident and that George McGee, the Florida driver who lost sight of the road when he dropped his phone, was not entirely to blame.",
      "\"Today's verdict represents justice for Naibel's tragic death and Dillon's lifelong injuries, holding Tesla and Musk accountable for propping up the company's trillion-dollar valuation with self-driving hype at the expense of human lives,\" said the plaintiffs' attorney Brett Schreiber in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case originally asked for $345 million in damages during closing arguments on Thursday.",
      "The most important piece of evidence in the trial, according to the plaintiffs' lawyers, was an augmented video of the crash that included data from the Autopilot computer. Tesla previously claimed the video was deleted, but a forensic data expert was able to recover it.",
      "\"What we ultimately learned from that augmented video is that the vehicle 100% knew that it was about to run off the roadway, through a stop sign, through a blinking red light, through a parked car and through a pedestrian, yet did nothing other than shut itself off when the crash was unavoidable,\" said Adam Boumel, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys.",
      "Tesla plans to appeal",
      "\"Today's verdict is wrong, and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\" Tesla said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs' lawyers blaming the car when the driver \u2014 from day one \u2014 admitted and accepted responsibility.\"",
      "Tesla also said it plans to appeal the decision.",
      "The case was a big test for the electric vehicle maker, which has been under scrutiny over the safety of its cars. Similar cases have been brought against Tesla, although many have been dismissed.",
      "\"This will open the floodgates,\" said Miguel Custodio, a car crash lawyer not involved in the Tesla case. \"It will embolden a lot of people to come to court.\"",
      "Todd Poses, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said his clients' goal in bringing this to court was ultimately to set a precedent that makes the public safer.",
      "\"Tesla needs to learn better, to do better, and to go back to the drawing board ... and whether it sets a precedent or not for Tesla, we hope that it does,\" Poses said.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who had signed up for a Biden-era repayment plan will start seeing interest accrue to their accounts starting today, Aug. 1, a change that could result in an additional $300 in monthly costs for the typical borrower, according to one analysis.",
      "The Department of Education announced on July 9 that it planned to restart charging interest for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created by the Biden administration in 2023 to help lighten the financial burden faced by millions of student loan borrowers.",
      "But two courts last year issued injunctions against the SAVE plan, effectively halting the repayment program. In response, the Biden administration moved all of the SAVE plan's enrollees into zero-interest forbearance, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "The Education Department says resuming interest on the loans represents a measure of \"fiscal responsibility,\" according to its July 9 statement. But the monetary impact on the roughly 8 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan could be significant, given that a typical borrower could see an increase of $300 per month due to new interest charges, according to a calculation by the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with higher-education debt.",
      "SAVE enrollees can opt to remain in forbearance, which means they won't need to make monthly payments, but \"the most significant impact is that your total loan balance will start growing again\" because interest will resume, Bethany Hubert, a financial aid specialist at lender Earnest, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"If you choose not to make payments, the accruing interest can really balloon your balance, making it much more challenging and expensive to pay back over time.\"",

      "While the typical borrower could see costs increase by about $300 per month, or $3,500 per year, the specific increase will depend on your loan balance.",
      "Borrowers can check how the resumption of interest on their loans will impact their payments by going to the\u00a0loan simulator\u00a0on the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said, although she noted that it might not yet include all the recent changes impacting student loans.",
      "Should I change repayment plans?",
      "Borrowers should evaluate the four repayment plans available, which can be found at here at the Federal Student Aid website, Hubert said.",
      "Changing plans will depend on your situation, added Betsy Mayotte, president of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors, a nonprofit that provides free advice for student borrowers.",
      "Borrowers who are seeking loan forgiveness, which can be earned after repaying a loan for anywhere from 10 years to 25 years, depending on the plan, may want switch because \"the SAVE forbearance doesn't count towards the payments needed to get the balance forgiven under those plans,\" she said.",
      "What about the new Repayment Assistance Plan?",
      "There's also a new repayment plan in the works that borrowers could consider, called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which is due in 2026 and is part of the \"big beautiful\" tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4.",
      "\"For earners who make less than $10,000, their [monthly] payment will be $10 under RAP,\" Hubert said.",
      "For those with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $10,000 per year, the repayments will be based on 1% to 10% of their income minus $50 in payments each month for each child the borrower has. \"With that in mind, we can estimate that a borrower who has an AGI of $45,000 and no children would have their monthly payment set at $150,\" she added.",
      "RAP payments could carry a higher monthly payment for some borrowers than under the SAVE plan, but the SAVE plan is likely to eventually be eliminated due to the court cases, Mayotte said.",
      "\"At a minimum, I would suggest trying to make payments that cover the monthly interest as it begins to accrue to prevent your balance from growing,\" Hubert added.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is poised to hit dozens of nations around the world with higher tariffs starting next week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday formally announced higher tariffs against more than 60 U.S. trading partners starting next week \u2014 just hours before the administration's self-imposed midnight deadline.",
      "The president signed an executive order listing out tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. The duties range as high as 41% for Syria and 40% for Laos and Myanmar, while almost no country's imports will face tariffs below 10%.",
      "The new tariffs apply to imports that are \"entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption,\" in seven days, the order said. Mr. Trump had vowed to impose higher tariffs starting just after midnight on Friday, Aug. 1. A White House official told CBS News the extra seven days were intended to give Customs and Border Protection enough time to implement the new tariff rates.",
      "\"[F]or most economies and most of our trading partners, the cost of doing trade tomorrow will be higher than it is today,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at management consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said prior to the release of Thursday's list.",
      "Mr. Trump set the latest deadline for trade agreements in April after announcing \u2014 and later suspending for 90 days \u2014 what he described as \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on more than 90 countries. A July 9 deadline for deals came and went, with the White House again stalling for time. But Mr. Trump had since vowed not to extend the deadline beyond Aug. 1 for most nations.",
      "Almost 70 trading partners are included on Thursday's list, and goods from countries that weren't listed will face 10% tariffs \u2014 the same baseline that Mr. Trump imposed in April.",
      "For some countries, Thursday's tariff list features lower rates than the ones that were threatened on Liberation Day. But other countries' tariffs were adjusted up slightly. For example, Madagascar was threatened with 47% tariffs in April and just 15% tariffs on Thursday, but Switzerland's rate jumped from 31% to 39%.",
      "For the handful of trading partners that have reached agreements with Mr. Trump in recent weeks \u2014 including Japan, South Korea and the European Union \u2014 the new tariff list reflects the terms of those trade deals.",
      "A senior administration official told reporters Thursday the new tariff list separates U.S. trading partners into three buckets. If the United States has a trade surplus with a country \u2014 meaning the U.S. exports more goods to the country than it imports \u2014 that nation's goods will face a 10% tariff rate. If the U.S. has a small trade deficit, imports from that country will generally face 15% tariffs. And countries that the U.S. has larger deficits with face higher tariffs, typically based on either the \"Liberation Day\" rate, a rate hashed out in a trade deal with the U.S. or a rate floated by Mr. Trump in a letter.",
      "Stiff tariffs on Canada",
      "Tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 are treated separately.",
      "Duties on Canadian goods will jump from 25% to 35% starting Friday, the White House announced Thursday, following through on a threat from earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump is also threatening tariff hikes for Mexico and China, but the U.S.' southern neighbor got a 90-day extension\u00a0on Thursday, and an Aug. 12 deadline to strike a deal with China is expected to be extended for three months, as well.",
      "In announcing the hike in Canadian tariffs, White House said Canada hadn't done enough to \"arrest, seize, detain or otherwise intercept ... traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.\"",
      "In a statement released early Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was \"disappointed\" by Mr. Trump's actions.",
      "\"Canada accounts for only 1% of U.S. fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes,\" he said.",
      "Carney added that some industries - including lumber, steel, aluminum and automobiles - are \"heavily impacted by U.S. duties and tariffs. For such sectors, the Canadian government will act to protect Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian, and diversity our export markets.\"",
      "In Beijing, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Friday that, \"China's opposition to the abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff and trade wars have no winners. Protectionism is in no one's interests.\"",
      "Amid concerns that the White House's trade agenda was fueling economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers, Trump administration officials this spring pledged to nail down \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "By that measure, his administration has come up far short of its goals. The White House has announced broad bilateral agreements with a handful of nations as well as the 27-member European Union, but those deals have lacked the extensively documented details typical of most trade deals, experts note.",
      "\"It's important to note that we don't even have any deals as deals are commonly understood, except maybe the U.K. agreement, which is still being discussed,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The countries that have yet to strike deals with the U.S., including major trading partners such as Canada and Mexico, account for 56% of American imports, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Shortly after the new tariff list was released, Mr. Trump told NBC News in an interview it's \"too late\" for countries that still haven't struck a trade agreement to avoid the new import duties \u2014 but he's still willing to negotiate after the higher tariffs take effect. He said he believes his trade strategy was going \"very well, very smooth,\" pointing to the revenue brought in by tariffs and the fact that inflation has not spiked.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "Tearing up the rules",
      "Mr. Trump re-entered office in January promising to rewrite the rules of international commerce, which he has long maintained disadvantage the U.S. and hurt American workers. In that effort, he has embraced tariffs as a way to reduce trade deficits with other nations, energize domestic manufacturers, generate federal revenue and gain leverage in foreign policy.",
      "In practice, the White House has struggled to deliver on that ambitious agenda, Daniel Altman, an economist and founder of investment newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"There were never enough trade negotiators in all of Washington to conclude all of these details by August 1,\" he said. \"We have some framework agreements that have made the headlines, but as we're finding out a lot of those deals include tariff rates that are pretty much the same as the base rate of 15% that the White House has mooted for the rest of the world.\"",
      "Yet despite the appearance of chaos that has attended some of the rollout of his new tariff regime, Mr. Trump has clearly succeeded in changing the terms of trade with several key economic partners in ways that could favor the U.S. In some cases, that includes winning the elimination or significant reductions in tariffs on American exports going the other way.",
      "Under its deal with the EU, for instance, the U.S. will impose a 15% tax on most of the trading bloc's imports, but the EU has agreed not to charge any levy on imports from the U.S.\u00a0Deals with Japan\u00a0and South Korea impose the same tariff rate on those countries' exports to the U.S.",
      "Other countries that struck trade deals with the U.S. have acceded to higher tariffs in hopes of ensuring good relations with Mr. Trump and avoiding even higher levies. Those include\u00a0Indonesia and the Philippines, which will each face a 19% tariff on their exports. The U.S. will subject imports from\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0to a 20% duty, plus a 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped via other countries.",
      "\"In any other time frame, one would have said that having the EU, Korea, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia and the United Kingdom covers an awful lot of world trade and U.S. trade,\" Alan Wolff, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics and former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda is also generating significant revenue. According to the U.S. Treasury, the U.S. in June brought in $27 billion in tariff revenue \u2014 more than three times what it collected in the same period a year ago.",
      "The White House has repeatedly insisted that tariff costs will be borne by foreign countries and that the levies will help spur investment in U.S. manufacturing. Trade experts note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, which often pass on those costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "Global financial markets fell in overnight trading after the White House tariff announcement. In the U.S., stock futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Complex were each down 0.9%, while Nasdaq Composite futures fell roughly 1%.",

    "published": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 15:31:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review a trade court's decision invalidating President Trump's 10% tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Thursday sharply probed\u00a0President Trump's use of an emergency powers law to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as higher duties are set to snap into place Friday for countries that have not yet reached trade deals with the administration.",
      "The 11 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments in the Trump administration's appeal of a ruling from a trade-focused lower court that found the president did not have the authority to hit foreign nations with 10% tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.",
      "While a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked the sweeping duties that the president assessed on most countries, the Federal Circuit temporarily reinstated the tariffs while it considers the dispute.",
      "The legal fights before the appeals court were brought by a group of 12 states and five small businesses, and their cases are a major test of the centerpiece of Mr. Trump's economic agenda. The Federal Circuit's decision is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. A ruling in favor of Mr. Trump from the conservative court is far from certain.",
      "As arguments got underway, several judges on the appeals court peppered Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer, about whether IEEPA authorizes the president to impose tariffs.",
      "One judge immediately noted that the law has never before been used to assess the levies on trading partners.",
      "Many other laws regulating trade include the word \"tariff,\" the judge said, \"but here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs, doesn't even mention them.\"",
      "Pointing to those trade statutes, which impose constraints on the duties that a president can assess, one of the judges questioned why a president would rely on those laws when IEEPA provides broader power under the Justice Department's interpretation.",
      "\"Your argument dislocates that entire U.S. trade-relief framework,\" he said.",
      "Later, looking at the harmonized tariff schedule, which sets tariff rates and categories for merchandise imported into the U.S., members of the court criticized the scope of Mr. Trump's levies, which cover nearly every country.",
      "\"It's a wholesale revision of the scheme that Congress enacted,\" a judge said, adding, \"it's really kind of asking for an extraordinary change\" to the legislature's approach to the tariff schedule.",
      "Other members of the Federal Circuit seemed concerned with the breadth of authority the president was claiming in relying on IEEPA to impose broad tariffs on trading partners.",
      "\"It seems to me you're asking for unbounded authority,\" one judge told Shumate.",
      "The president has relied on tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he said are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Since Mr. Trump announced his sprawling tariff regime on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" the administration has said it reached trade deals with five Asian countries, the United Kingdom and the European Union. Many economists argue tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The tariffs announced in early April set a 10% baseline tariff on nearly every country, and reciprocal tariffs above the 10% rate on dozens of trading partners. While the reciprocal levies were initially supposed to take effect April 9, Mr. Trump issued a 90-day pause and lowered the rate for countries subject to the higher tariffs to 10%. Some of those higher\u00a0reciprocal duties are set to go back into place Friday for countries the administration has not reached trade agreements with.",
      "Mr. Trump has since said that he would increase the blanket tariff rate for nations that don't enter into trade deals with the U.S. to \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range.\"",
      "Only the so-called Liberation Day tariffs, and higher levies on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican imports that the president said were to combat the trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S., are at issue in the cases before the Federal Circuit.",
      "No president before Mr. Trump had invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, and the Constitution vests the power to assess levies in Congress. IEEPA does not include any references to tariffs or duties, and it has typically been used by presidents to impose economic sanctions on foreign nations.",
      "Under IEEPA, the president can exercise the law's authority in instances involving \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security or the economy for which \"a national emergency has been declared.\"",
      "In rolling out his tariffs, Mr. Trump claimed that trade deficits and the flow of illicit drugs across U.S. borders constituted national emergencies and were threats to national security and the economy. Shumate argued before the Federal Circuit that courts should not second-guess the president's determination that trade deficits are an emergency, and some of the judges seemed inclined to agree that the consequences of those imbalances would fit within IEEPA's framework.",
      "He also said that the emergency powers law authorizes a president to \"regulate ... any ... importation,\" and that covers the imposition of tariffs.",
      "But the challengers to his tariffs argue that trade deficits have persisted for 50 years, and they warned that if allowed, the president would have limitless power to set tariffs of any amount against any product.",
      "\"That is a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,\" Neal Katyal, who argued on behalf of the small businesses, told the Federal Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that a different law, a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, governs the president's imposition of tariffs in response to trade deficits, but caps the duties at 15% and limits their duration to five months.",
      "In addition to claiming that IEEPA does not authorize Mr. Trump's tariffs, lawyers for the small businesses and states argue that they violate the major questions and nondelegation doctrines, legal principles that have in recent years been raised by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "Under the major questions doctrine, an agency that seeks to decide an issue of major political or economic significance must have clear authorization from Congress. And under the nondelegation doctrine, Congress cannot delegate its legislative power to executive branch agencies unless it sets out an \"intelligible\" and judicially enforceable principle to guide an agency.",
      "\"Congress alone has constitutional authority to impose tariffs,\" lawyers for the states wrote in a filing. \"But under President Trump's reading of IEEPA, Congress gave him the authority to rewrite the tariff schedules at his whim.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the tariffs and said they were imposed because the president believes they are needed to address \"grave threats\" to U.S. national security and the economy.",
      "\"President Trump has found that America's exploding trade deficit, the implications of that deficit for our economy and national security, and a fentanyl importation crisis that has claimed thousands of American lives constitute national emergencies,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They noted that Mr. Trump's plans for tariffs were a key component of his 2024 presidential campaign and said they've been successful at sparking negotiations on trade deals with U.S. partners.",
      "\"The CIT's injunction would, if affirmed, disrupt the Executive Branch's ongoing, sensitive diplomatic negotiations with virtually every major trading partner. And it would unilaterally deprive the United States of a powerful tool for combating systemic distortions in the global trading system, thus allowing other nations to continue to hold American exporters hostage to their unreasonable, discriminatory, and sometimes retaliatory trade policies,\" Justice Department lawyers argued.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",
      "Earlier this month, the government reported that its more closely watched Consumer Price Index, its primary inflation measure, also ticked higher in June as the cost of heavily imported items such as appliances, furniture and toys increased.",

      "\"We have to increase prices because when the container of wine I've ordered lands, I have to pay 100% of whatever the tariff is on that wine,\" Root said on Wednesday at a U.S. Wine Trade Alliance (USWTA) roundtable on the impact of the new U.S. tariffs on the EU.",

      "\"We had hoped to shoulder that cost because if you put your whisky up too much, then people won't buy it. But to cover that, it means we'd have to add 10% to the price of a bottle, so it's a tricky one,\" he said, noting that a bottle of Abbey Distillery scotch that currently retails for about $86 could rise to about $94.",

      "Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research firm that is tracking the effects of tariffs on food and beverage costs in the U.S, said that the wine and spirits business is more exposed to tariffs because consumers are less likely to switch to domestic substitutes.",
      "\"It's a little different when you're assessing the impact on prices related to wine and spirits compared to other goods because consumers have certain tastes and preferences,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the finalized deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "The USWTA is also urging U.S. trade officials to include wine in its list of exempted goods under the new U.S.-EU trade deal.",
      "\"We are heartened that negotiations are leaving room for wine to be included under the zero-for-zero exemption structure,\" Aneff said in a statement. \"Now is the time to ensure wine is prioritized in the final agreement.\"",
      "Addressing the EU tariff agreement, Distilled Spirits Council President and CEO Chris Swonger\u00a0said\u00a0the group is also \"optimistic that in the days ahead this positive meeting and agreement will lead to a return to zero-for-zero tariffs for U.S. and EU spirits products.\"",
      "Peril for restaurants",
      "The stepped up U.S. tariffs on the EU wouldn't just hurt consumers \u2014 they could also lead to the loss of thousands of jobs at manufacturers and distributors, according to industry experts. Restaurants, which depend on sales of European wines to buoy them financially, also could feel the impact in the form of slimmer profits.",
      "Typically, if a restaurant pays $15 for a bottle of wine from France or Italy, the two largest exporters to the U.S., it will charge patrons $15 a glass, Aneff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Their margin is five times the cost of the bottle,\" he said. \"And for a restaurant that's not a luxury \u2014 it's an absolute necessity.\"",
      "Such profits ensure that restaurants can stay in business and preserve jobs.",
      "EU imports \"are vital for the 47,500 wine retailers, 6,000 importers and distributors, and hundreds of thousands of restaurants around the country,\" Aneff said. \"In a nutshell, wine from the European Union brings an incredible economic surplus to businesses in the U.S. No other product allows us to capture such a huge percentage of the revenue generated here in the U.S.\"",

      "President Trump on Thursday said he's giving Mexico an additional 90 days to strike a trade deal, with the announcement coming a day before his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the nation.",
      "Mr. Trump had said earlier this month that the 30% import duties would begin on Friday for Mexican imports, saying at the time that the country had not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "In his Thursday social media post, the president said he agreed to a 90-day extension during a phone conversation with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, which he described as \"very successsful.\"",
      "The president has turned to tariffs as a way to force trading partners to negotiate deals that he says are more favorable to the U.S. and reduce trade imbalances. Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline to strike new trade deals with Mexico and many other nations, the Trump administration has announced trade deals with\u00a0five Asian countries, the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0and the\u00a0European Union.",
      "\"We will be talking to Mexico over the next 90 Days with the goal of signing a Trade Deal somewhere within the 90 Day period of time, or longer,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He added that the \"exact same Deal as we had\" with Mexico will be extended during that time, which\u00a0 includes a \"25% Fentanyl Tariff, 25% Tariff on Cars, and 50% Tariff on Steel, Aluminum, and Copper.\"",
      "Many economists project that tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices because the import duties are paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, which then pass on some or all of the costs to shoppers. While inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively muted, there are signs that the import duties are pushing some U.S. prices higher.",
      "For instance, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher in June. Many goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",

He said South Korea will be \"OPEN TO TRADE\" and will accept U.S. automobiles.",
      "South Korea is the latest key U.S. trading partner to reach an agreement with the Trump administration, ahead of a Friday deadline when Mr. Trump says he'll impose hefty tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae-myung confirmed his country had reached a deal with the U.S. in a Facebook post.",
      "In addition to the 15% tariff, Mr. Trump said South Korea agreed to \"give to the United States $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself.\" Lee said the fund will help South Korean companies enter the U.S. market, especially in industries like semiconductors and biotech, and $150 billion of the total $350 billion will focus on shipbuilding.",
      "South Korea will also buy $100 billion dollars' worth of liquified natural gas or other energy products, and will \"invest a large sum of money for their investment purposes,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "South Korea was the U.S.'s sixth-largest trading partner last year, not including multi-country blocs like the European Union, according to Census Bureau data. The U.S. imported $131.5 billion worth of South Korean goods, and South Korea bought $65.5 billion in American goods.",
      "More than $45 billion worth of U.S. imports from South Korea were cars and car parts, according to federal statistics. Cars from South Korea will be subject to the 15% tariffs, rather than the blanket 25% rate that Mr. Trump has imposed on foreign cars and car parts from other countries, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said on X.",
      "The president also\u00a0announced a deal with Japan last week\u00a0and a deal with the 27-nation EU on Sunday. Deals are still outstanding with the U.S.'s three largest single trading partners:\u00a0Canada, Mexico and\u00a0China.",
      "Trump strikes trade deals as tariff threats loom",
      "Mr. Trump has spent much of his first six months in office pressing U.S. trading partners to agree to trade deals \u2014 and floating large-scale tariffs if they don't correct what he views as imbalanced trading practices.",
      "Most countries, including South Korea, have faced 10% tariffs since April, when Mr. Trump delayed a set of higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days to buy his administration time to negotiate. Then this month, the president sent letters to South Korea and around two dozen other trading partners telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Friday, Aug. 1, unless deals are reached.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood behind that deadline, writing on Wednesday: \"THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE \u2014 IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.\"",
      "Trading partners like Indonesia, the Philippines, the EU and Japan have struck trade deals before then \u2014 generally agreeing to tariffs that are lower than the ones threatened by Mr. Trump but higher than the 10% baseline.",
      "Meanwhile, negotiations with China, Canada and Mexico remain ongoing. Higher tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect on Aug. 12 unless the two countries strike a deal, though an extension is possible, U.S. officials have said.",
      "All told, the president said this week he expects that most imports to the U.S. will face a baseline tariff of 15% to 20%. By comparison, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports in 2023 was around 2.5%, according to figures from the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan policy research center.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing. But many economists warn tariffs can lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves rattled financial markets.",
      "Consumer prices have been relatively stable so far this year \u2014 though above the Federal Reserve's 2%-per-year target. Some economists say that's partly because companies have taken steps to prevent short-term shocks from tariffs.",

    "summary": "The Fed is maintaining its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday it's keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook.",
      "The decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "Two voting FOMC members, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted in favor of lowering the central bank's short-term rate \u2014 a rare show of dissent at the Fed, where monetary policy is generally set by consensus. It is the first time since 1993 that two member of the Fed's Board of Governors have voted against the chair, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.",
      "In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.",
      "\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.",
      "Powell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank cut interest rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "Wall Street had anticipated the Fed's decision, with economists pegging the probability the central bank would hold rates steady at 96%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Why is the Fed holding rates steady?",
      "The Fed's Powell has signaled the Fed remains cautious about lowering rates given the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which he has said could dent economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks the dissents by Bowman and Waller represent a minority opinion on the FOMC, with most of the rate-setting panel's voting members preferring to hold rates steady amid amid concern about inflation.",
      "Inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, with the Consumer Price Index rising\u00a0in June to an annualized rate of 2.7%. At the same time, the economy remains solid. The economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3% rate between April and June, according to data released Wednesday, with economists saying the rebound in growth from earlier this year supports the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady.",
      "\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"",
      "When could the Fed cut rates?",
      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its two-day meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to FactSet. The FOMC, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Although the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.",
      "Asked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred, saying that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of CPI data.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.",
      "\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"",
      "He added, \"We will make sure this doesn't move from being a one-time price increase to serious inflation.\"",
      "Powell's remarks emphasizing the solid U.S. economy, as well as the risks from tariffs, signaled to some economists that a September rate cut might not be in the cards.",
      "\" For [a September rate cut] to happen, the rest of the FOMC will need to become either less concerned about the inflation outlook or more concerned about the economic and labor market outlook,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North American economist Stephen Brown in a report.",

      "The U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady.

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending what's known as a de minimis exemption allowing low-value parcels that are shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs.",
      "The White House said it's closing what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S. The order goes into effect Aug. 29.",
      "The exemption had applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, and allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "\"President Trump is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "Mr. Trump in May ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong, which had allowed retailers like Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S. according to the White House.",
      "The de minimis provision, which was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after that law's passage, was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has surged over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to nearly 1.4 billion. Customs and Border Patrol processes more than 4 million de minimis shipments to the U.S. daily, according to the White House.",
      "Retailers such as Shein and Temu were forced to scramble when the loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong was suspended earlier this year. China-based Temu halted shipments of Chinese goods to American customers and shifted to only selling products to U.S. shoppers that could be sourced from the company's U.S. warehouses.",

    "story": [
      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Although Mr. Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, economists think the central bank is very likely to stand pat when officials announce their latest policy move on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday that the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",
      "The president criticized India for buying energy products from Russia \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\"",
      "In a separate post, the president said, \"WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!\"",
      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",

    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

      "Pirro, a former county prosecutor and elected judge, was confirmed in a 50-45 vote. She has been in the job as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia on an acting basis since May. Before then, she co-hosted \"The Five\" on Fox News on weekday evenings, where she frequently interviewed Mr. Trump.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he ordered his administration to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "An appeals court late Friday mostly kept in place restrictions on \"roving\" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing with a lower court judge who found that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration in Southern California appeared to have been predicated on people's race and other factors, like speaking Spanish.",
      "A panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit largely denied a Trump administration request to suspend the lower court ruling, which required federal immigration officials to have reasonable suspicion that someone is in the country illegally before detaining them.",
      "The immigration raids at the center of the legal battle triggered massive protests in the Los Angeles area in June, as well as widespread fears among the region's large Latino community. While most demonstrations were peaceful, instances of violence led President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles with orders to protect federal buildings and the immigration agents enforcing his far-reaching crackdown on illegal immigration. Most of them have since been demobilized.",
      "Those high-profile immigration arrests in California have continued, led by Customs and Border Protection agents who have been assigned to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers with furthering the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign \u2014 in some cases, far away from the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Beyond requiring CBP and ICE to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone, the July order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong prohibited federal agents from basing arrests on people's race or ethnicity, the fact that they speak Spanish or have an accent, their presence in a location, or their occupation.",
      "Frimpong stated that any immigration arrests that relied exclusively on these factors violated the U.S. Constitution's 4th Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.",
      "\"We agree with the district court that, in the context of the Central District of California, the four enumerated factors at issue \u2014 apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together \u2014 describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,'\" the 9th Circuit panel wrote in its opinion Friday.",
      "The panel was comprised of Circuit Judges Ronald M. Gould, Marsha S. Berzon, and Jennifer Sung, appointees of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden.",
      "The cases cited in the lawsuit against the Los Angeles-area immigration sweeps involved arrests in June near a car wash, a tow yard and other locations where U.S. citizens were among those questioned about their legal status and detained by federal agents. Advocates have described the operations as \"roving patrols.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit did alter one part of Frimpong's ruling, removing an exception to her ban on using the four factors that include people's race and vocation when making arrests. The panel said that an \"except as permitted by law\" clause in her order was too vague.",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates hailed Friday's ruling, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration sweeps as indiscriminate raids that have instilled fear in the Los Angeles area.",
      "\"Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to live, work, and belong in their community without being hunted, harassed, or locked away,\" said Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a Los Angeles-based group that represents those facing deportation.",
      "The Trump administration has maintained in court that federal officials rely on intelligence packages and certain information \u2014 like \"past experiences\" that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally frequent or work at certain locations \u2014 when carrying out immigration enforcement operations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Saturday, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that \"unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people.\"",

    "story": [
      "A panel of federal judges on Friday limited President Trump's effort to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, saying his administration can't unilaterally suspend laws that bar the U.S. from deporting migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture.",
      "The ruling centers on a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump just hours after he returned to the White House in January, ordering the closure of the asylum system. U.S. border officials have relied on the order to summarily expel those entering the country illegally, without allowing them to request asylum. Mr. Trump justified the sweeping measure on the grounds that the country is facing an \"invasion\" of migrants.",
      "The three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lifted its administrative pause on a July ruling from a federal judge who found Mr. Trump's proclamation defied U.S. laws that require the federal government to hear the claims of migrants who want to apply for humanitarian protection out of fear that they could be harmed if deported.",
      "That ruling by U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss struck down the Trump administration's asylum ban and would've required officials to stop enforcing it on a legal class comprised of migrants who are or will be in the U.S.",
      "While it lifted its stay on Moss' ruling, the D.C. Circuit panel also narrowed his order, limiting the class members eligible for relief to asylum-seekers already on American soil while Mr. Trump's decree is in effect. The appellate court also limited the scope of Moss' ruling, partially granting a request from the Trump administration.",
      "The panel allowed the Trump administration to continue using the president's proclamation to deny migrants access to the U.S. asylum system, noting that U.S. law permits, but does not require, the government to grant asylum to those who prove they could be persecuted because of their race, religion, politics or other factors.",
      "But the panel also said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to prevent migrants from applying for other forms of humanitarian protections that the U.S. is legally required to give to certain migrants fleeing persecution and torture. They're known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Those protections have a higher legal threshold than asylum, but unlike asylum, they are mandatory, not discretionary, and must be granted to those who meet the requirements.",
      "The panel was made up of Circuit Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, as well as Gregory G. Katsas, an appointee of Mr. Trump. Each judge filed their own statements in the case, with Pillard and Katsas disagreeing with some aspects of the ruling.",
      "While they had some disagreements, all three judges said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to ignore laws around \"withholding of removal\" or Convention Against Torture protections. Pillard said she would've also blocked the administration from denying migrants the right to apply for asylum.",
      "The judges scheduled expedited proceedings to decide the merits of the case, asking both the government and the advocates challenging Mr. Trump's proclamation to file briefs through Sept. 26.",
      "The lawsuit that triggered Friday's decision was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, who have denounced the Trump administration's border crackdown as a draconian policy that has sent migrants to harm's way.",
      "\"The President secured the border in record time at an unprecedented level by using every available legal tool provided by Congress,\" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"A rogue district judge took those tools away, threatening the safety and security of Americans and ignoring a Supreme Court decision issued only days earlier admonishing district courts for granting nationwide injunctions. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring integrity to our immigration system and to our justice system.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have credited the president's proclamation and other actions \u2014 including the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the southern border \u2014 for a historic drop in illegal crossings there.",
      "In July, just 4,600 migrants were caught crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest monthly tally recorded by Border Patrol and a figure the Biden administration reported daily during many months. While public monthly reports started in fiscal year 2000, annual data suggest the last time Border Patrol had that level of apprehensions was in the 1960s.",

      "The White House's letters to 17 drug companies, including AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, asked for commitments within 60 days to sell drugs for Medicaid patients and all new drugs at \"most favored nation\" rates. The president posted images of the letters to Truth Social.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order in May telling federal officials to draw up \"most favored nation\" regulations unless pharmaceutical companies made progress toward cutting prices. This week's letters \u2014 which were addressed to Bourla and the other CEOs \u2014 accused the drugmakers of promising \"more of the same\" since then.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 21:08:47 -0400",
    "summary": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin told CBS News' \"The Takeout\" that environmental policy can't \"strangulate out of existence\" energy policy.",
    "story": [
      "When the Environmental Protection Agency announced\u00a0it would roll back regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 especially from motor vehicles \u2014 it touted annual savings for Americans of $54 billion. The EPA said eliminating Biden-era policies, which encouraged higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and electric vehicle adoption to limit tailpipe emissions, would enable consumers to \"have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.\"",
      "But a CBS News review of the agency's own regulatory impact analysis of the proposal found that gasoline prices would increase, and nearly a half million jobs would be lost by 2035, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency, which was cited in the EPA's report.",
      "Cost of gasoline",
      "In the EPA's July analysis, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which collects and analyzes energy data, showed Biden-era policies that were adopted by the end of 2024 would dramatically bring down the future cost of gasoline because more consumers would be driving electric vehicles, hybrids and fuel-efficient cars that require less gas.",
      "It is challenging to predict the future gas prices because they're subject to high uncertainty and market volatility, but under a future scenario where Biden-era policies have been revoked under the Trump administration, the EIA projects gasoline prices will continue to increase because of a higher demand for gas-powered cars and fuel.",
      "The former administrator of the EIA, Joseph DeCarolis, explained in an email that if the government \"disincentivizes electric vehicle purchases, more consumers will purchase gasoline vehicles resulting in higher gasoline consumption and high gasoline prices for everyone.\"",
      "\"There's a clear causal connection between rescinding measures promoting electric vehicles, such as EPA tailpipe standards, and the projection of higher gasoline prices,\" he said.",
      "When asked in an interview with CBS News' \"The Takeout with Major Garrett\" about how this plan could raise gas prices, Zeldin did not directly address the question.",
      "Instead, he argued that previous policies like an electric vehicle mandate were costing trillions of dollars to regulate climate pollution, saying the policies were \"seeking to strangulate out of existence, entire sectors of our economy, and specifically our energy economy.",
      "'It's important that we are applying common sense,\" Zeldin said, \"that we are cognizant of these economic demands and that, wherever possible, when we can protect the environment and grow the economy that we will choose both.\"",
      "Neither the Biden nor Obama administrations implemented EV mandates, though both encouraged EV adoptions by Americans and businesses.",
      "Zeldin reiterated the Trump administration's stance that the EPA does not have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act unless an act of Congress changes that.",
      "\"Here's my message: If Congress wants the EPA to be regulating the heck out of carbon dioxide, well, they could put it inside of law,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Impacts on fuel efficiency",
      "Along with rolling back greenhouse gas emissions standards to limit tailpipe emissions, the EPA would also rescind fuel efficiency measures.",
      "Under Biden-era fuel efficiency policies, a new standard gas-powered car was expected to get 47.1 miles per gallon by 2027, and by 2035, cars were expected to achieve 61.2 mpg, according to EIA data.",
      "Without the Biden policies, model 2027 cars are supposed to meet a 43.6 mpg standard and gradually increase to 50.5 mpg by 2035.",
      "Light trucks and SUVs, beginning in model year 2027, under a scenario where Biden policies are revoked by the Trump administration, are set to reach fuel efficiency of 27.2 mpg and increase to 28.6 mpg by 2035. Had the Biden policies remained in place, SUVs and light trucks were expected to meet a 28.4 mpg standard in 2027 and increase to 46.2 mpg by 2035, according to EIA data.",
      "Future job losses",
      "The EIA's own data estimates that a future scenario \u2014 where Biden-Obama emissions standards are revoked \u2014 would lead to a loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035. Jobs would begin to rebound by 2045, but not enough to overcome the significant losses suffered in previous decades.",
      "Peter Huether, senior transportation research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a statement, \"Drivers would pay thousands of dollars more in fuel and maintenance costs over the life of a vehicle, and businesses could lose billions annually from higher trucking costs\" as a result of the Trump administration's deregulation.",
      "\"These costs would ripple through the economy, raising prices for everyday goods and undercutting job growth,\" Huether said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's decision to fire a key official responsible for employment reports, telling CBS News on Friday that Mr. Trump has \"real concerns\" about the accuracy of federal economic data.",
      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

    "summary": "The NTSB heard testimony from air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army about the mid-air collision of an Army helicopter and passenger plane.",
    "story": [
      "Over the course of three days of investigative hearings, the National Transportation and Safety Board sought to gather more information about the factors that lead to the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January between an Army helicopter and a passenger plane.",
      "The NTSB heard testimony from air traffic controllers, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army, and the families of several of the victims were in attendance. At one point on the first day of the hearings, NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said of the circumstances leading up to the crash, \"Every sign was there that there was a safety risk.\" Addressing the families, she said the hearings would be \"a critical part of our ongoing investigation.\"",
      "On Jan. 29, a Black Hawk helicopter struck an American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, as it was coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.",
      "The NTSB will continue its fact finding and will compile a final report with determinations about the probable cause, likely within the next year.",
      "Here are the top takeaways from the hearings:",
      "Helicopter's altitude measurements showed significant discrepancies",
      "The Black Hawk crew members were relying on a barometric altimeter \u2014 a gauge that determines altitude based on air pressure \u2014 which may have given them incorrect information, according to NTSB investigators. The crew was calling out altitudes that were lower than the actual height at which the helicopter was flying.",
      "The helicopter and commercial airliner collided approximately 300 feet above the Potomac River, and the maximum altitude for helicopters at that part of the route near D.C.'s Reagan Airport is 200 feet.",
      "The NTSB, as part of its investigation, tested three helicopters that are in the same battalion as the one that crashed and found that the barometric altimeter for all three was off by 80 to 130 feet. Army representatives on Wednesday told investigators that discrepancy is within the accepted variability because pilots are trained to maintain their altitude at plus or minus 100 feet.",
      "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CBS News' senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave the NTSB calculated the margin of error on Route Four in that area of the Potomac to be 75 feet.",
      "The Army said it is conducting additional reviews to determine how to proceed, frustrating investigators who asked why it would not make changes to the equipment, based on the findings of the NTSB tests.",
      "In 2022, an FAA working group considered moving helicopter traffic away from the airport, but ultimately did not.",
      "Airplane pilots knew they were going to be hit",
      "Transcripts from the airplane's cockpit voice recorder show the pilots received an automated verbal warning about traffic in the vicinity approximately 20 seconds before the collision. Less than two seconds before impact, the pilots shouted in alarm. Flight data indicates the plane's pilots attempted to climb to avoid the helicopter just before impact.",
      "The transcripts also reveal the pilots of the American Airlines flight questioned the move to Runway 33. The plane was originally supposed to land on Runway 1 but was redirected by air traffic controllers to Runway 33. As it was trying to land on that runway, the helicopter and plane collided.",
      "Black Hawk pilots missed key command from air traffic controller",
      "The pilots of the Black Hawk missed a key word when communicating with the air traffic control tower, according to a transcript released during the hearings of the conversation between the helicopter crew and the control tower.",
      "Fifteen seconds before the collision, DCA Tower asked the helicopter if it had the regional jet in sight. Four seconds later, the DCA Tower instructed the helicopter to pass behind the plane. The Black Hawk's cockpit voice recorder indicated that the phrase \"pass behind\" was rendered inaudible because a helicopter crew member pressed the microphone key.",
      "FAA acknowledged air traffic controller did not warn airliner that the helicopter might cross its path",
      "Although it was already known \u2014 based on control tower audio from that night \u2014 that the controller did not warn the American Airlines plane that the Black Hawk might cross its path, the FAA only openly acknowledged this for the first time during this week's hearings.",
      "In a key moment from the second day, Homendy asked FAA Air Traffic Oversight Service executive director Nick Fuller if any traffic advisories or alerts were issued to the plane. He responded, \"No safety alerts.\"",
      "Homendy then asked, \"Should the local controller have let the [plane] crew know that there was a helicopter there?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Fuller responded.",
      "Medivac pilot said presence of military helicopters in National Airport airspace makes him \"uncomfortable\"",
      "Rick Dressler, of Metro Aviation \u2013 which operates medical helicopters \u2014 was asked if there are units flying in the National Airport airspace that make him uncomfortable.",
      "\"I don't like saying that first heli of [U.S. Air Force] from Andrews (Air Base) and I don't like saying that 12th Aviation Battalion gives us all pause in the community\u2026,\" Dressler said, but \"we are all very uncomfortable when those two units are operating.\"",

The Supreme Court indicated this week it will consider whether to hear Maxwell's case in September, and Comer said her deposition can take place after the court decides on whether to take the case.",

      "A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending the legal status and deportation protections for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "While it could be suspended by a higher court, the ruling is a reprieve for more than 60,000 immigrants who had been previously allowed by the U.S. government to live and work in the country legally for years and in some cases, since the late 1990s, under the Temporary Protected Status program.",
      "Immigrants from Nepal enrolled in the TPS program were set to lose their legal status next week, on Aug. 5. TPS holders from Honduras and Nicaragua, meanwhile, were slated to see their work permits and deportation protections under the program expire in early September.",
      "U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ordered the planned TPS terminations for these countries to be postponed through at least Nov. 18, when she scheduled a hearing on the merits of a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision. Thompson said the delay could be extended beyond Nov. 18.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the Department of Homeland Security to offer a temporary safe haven \u2014 in the form of deportation deferrals and work authorization \u2014 to immigrants from countries beset by armed conflict, an environmental disaster or other crises.",
      "Those enrolled in TPS are generally immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally or who arrived legally on temporary visas and then applied for the humanitarian program.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, arguing that some of them are contrary to U.S. national interests and that they've been in place for too long, despite their temporary nature and improved conditions in the relevant countries.",
      "The administration, for example, has noted that the TPS programs for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in 1999, after Hurricane Mitch caused catastrophic floods and killed thousands in Central America. The TPS program for Nepal was announced in 2015, after an earthquake hit the small Asian country. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said all three countries have recovered from those environmental disasters.",
      "But Thompson, the San Francisco-based federal judge, said the TPS holders who sued the Trump administration were likely to succeed in their arguments that Noem's decisions were \"preordained\" actions that did not fully consider lingering conditions in Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",
      "Thompson, who was appointed by former President Biden, also found the plaintiffs were likely to prevail in arguing that Noem's decisions were \"motivated by racial animus.\" Thompson cited statements by Noem that she said stereotyped the TPS program and associated immigrants with criminality.",
      "The judge also referenced a comment made by President Trump during the 2024 campaign in which he said migrants entering the U.S. illegally were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"",
      "\"The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood. The Court disagrees,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",
      "DHS castigated the ruling in a statement Friday, calling it \"disgusting\" and saying it \"sounds like a New York Times opinion piece.\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused the judge of \"race-baiting\" and said the administration will appeal.",
      "According to official government statistics, there are 72,000 Hondurans, 12,700 Nepalis and 4,000 Nicaraguans enrolled in the TPS policy. Some of them, however, have been able to gain green cards, or lawful permanent U.S. residency, including 21,000 of the Honduran TPS holders. An estimated 5,500 and 1,100 TPS holders from Nepal and Nicaragua, respectively, have also become permanent residents, according to government data.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, his administration has announced plans to terminate TPS for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, including Afghans, Cameroonians, Haitians and Venezuelans.",

      "Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has been transferred from a federal correctional facility in Tallahassee, Florida, to a facility in Bryan, Texas, CBS News has learned. No reason was given for the move.",
      "Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence after she was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action by the Supreme Court, which is set to discuss whether to take up her case at its closed-door conference in late September.",
      "Maxwell had been held at the federal correctional institute in Tallahassee, a low-security facility with a population of nearly 1,200 inmates. The federal prison camp in Bryan, where she's been moved, is considered minimum security and houses 635 inmates, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",
      "The move was condemned in a statement by several of Epstein and Maxwell's accusers, including the family of Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "\"It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas. This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes,\" they said in a statement.",
      "\"The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender. The Trump administration should not credit a word Maxwell says, as the government itself sought charges against Maxwell for being a serial liar. This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better,\" the statement continued.",
      "A low-security facility like the one in Tallahassee has double-fenced perimeters, components geared toward work and other programs and has mostly dormitory or cubicle housing, according to the Bureau of Prisons. The staff-to-inmate ratio in low-security institutions is also higher than it is in minimum security facilities.",
      "Minimum security facilities, including the Bryan Federal Prison Camp, have dormitory housing for inmates, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and little or no perimeter fencing, according to the Bureau of Prisons. It\u00a0 also states that these facilities, which are all referred to as Federal Prison Camps, are \"work- and program-oriented.\"",
      "The transfer comes days after Maxwell met with Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tallahassee to discuss Epstein's case last week. Her lawyer, David Oscar Markus, said she answered all of Blanche's questions across two days of talks. Blanche sought to interview Maxwell as the White House and Justice Department have faced pressure to release more information about Epstein and the files the government amassed during its investigation.",
      "The backlash arose after the Justice Department and FBI\u00a0released a memo\u00a0earlier this month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed he died by suicide in jail in 2019, shortly after he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The memo also concluded that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they did not plan to release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "But the findings frustrated some of President Trump's allies, who were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there is nothing left to divulge.",
      "In addition to Blanche's interview with Maxwell, the Justice Department\u00a0asked federal judges\u00a0in New York who handled Epstein's and Maxwell's cases to unseal transcripts from those grand jury proceedings.",
      "Congressional investigators have also subpoenaed Maxwell to sit for a deposition. But Markus, her lawyer, said she would only be willing to provide lawmakers\u00a0with information if she were granted immunity by a House committee or clemency by Mr. Trump. The House Oversight Committee said Friday that it will\u00a0postpone its planned interview until after the Supreme Court considers her appeal on Sept. 29.",
      "Epstein was initially investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in 2008. He was arrested again on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 and was awaiting trial at the time of his death, which the medical examiner ruled a suicide.",

    "summary": "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration's policy of rapidly deporting migrants who were granted parole to enter the U.S. legally.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from rapidly deporting migrants who entered the U.S. legally on humanitarian grounds, potentially curtailing arrests at immigration courts that have triggered controversy across the country.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb of Washington, D.C., barred federal immigration officials from using two Trump administration directives to apply a fast-track deportation process known as expedited removal on migrants who were granted immigration parole to enter the U.S. at an official port of entry. Parole is an immigration authority that allows federal officials to admit foreigners on humanitarian grounds, and lets them live and work in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis.",
      "If left in place, Cobb's ruling could significantly hinder the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to ramp up its mass deportation campaign by targeting migrants allowed into the U.S. under the Biden administration through the parole authority. The Justice Department is expected to appeal her order.",
      "One operation in particular that could be curtailed by Cobb's ruling is a Trump administration effort to convince immigration judges to dismiss the court cases of certain migrants, so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can arrest them after their hearings and place them in expedited removal.",
      "Unlike immigration court cases, which typically take years to complete due to a backlog of millions of unresolved claims, expedited removal allows officials to more quickly deport migrants who arrived to the U.S. in the past two years. Those placed in that process face summary deportation from the U.S. unless they express concerns of being persecuted in their home countries and prove to an asylum officer that their fear is credible.",
      "The courthouse arrests have been reported in cities across the U.S., with videos emerging showing ICE officials detaining migrants immediately after their hearings conclude. In some cases, those taken into custody have been seen weeping and visibly distraught. The practice has been strongly decried by Democratic lawmakers and advocates, who say it punishes people who are trying to follow the legal process by showing up to their hearings.",
      "In her opinion, Cobb found the Trump administration's efforts to be illegal, saying the lawsuit against the expedited deportations raised a \"question of fair play.\" She noted the plaintiffs in the case, two migrants from Cuba and Venezuela, had \"played by the rules,\" entered the country with the government's permission and attended their court hearings \u2014 and were nonetheless targeted for expedited deportation.",
      "\"This case's underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,\" Cobb wrote. \"Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that \u2014 as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers \u2014 may look to them more and more like the countries from which they tried to escape?\"",
      "Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in U.S. immigration law, said Cobb's order could mean that \"several hundred thousand people will be temporarily spared from immediate removal under the expedited removal procedures.\"",
      "Yale-Loehr noted the ruling is a reprieve for many of the more than 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who were allowed into the U.S. through the parole authority, under a Biden administration sponsorship policy. It also protects some of the nearly 1 million migrants paroled into the U.S. along the southern border under another Biden-era policy powered by a now-discontinued phone app known as CBP One.",
      "In a statement, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin denounced Friday's order.",
      "\"This ruling is lawless and won't stand,\" McLaughlin said.",

In June, the House\u00a0approved a White House request\u00a0to claw back $1.1 billion in already appointed federal funds from the CPB. The Senate Appropriations Committee's 2026 appropriations bill eliminated funding for the CPB for the first time in over 50 years.",
      "\"Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,\" said CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison in a statement. \"CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care.\"",

The CPB did not say exactly how many positions that was.\u00a0A \"small transition team will remain through January 2026 to ensure a responsible and orderly closeout of operations,\" the organization said.",
      "Mr. Trump also fired three members of the CPB's five-person board in April. In response, the CPB sued, arguing the president was exceeding his authority, but that case was dropped on Friday.",
      "Both PBS and NPR, the most high-profile public media organizations, have long been the target of Republican criticism and have been preparing for the possibility of cuts since Mr. Trump's reelection. The broadcasters receive roughly half a billion dollars in public funding through the CPB. In March, PBS CEO Paula Kerger and NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher defended their organizations from accusations of bias in testimony before a House subcommittee.",
      "Maher warned that defunding public radio poses \"a real risk to the public safety of the country.\" She said some NPR stations receive \"more than 50% of their budget\" from federal funding and may face layoffs and station closures.",
      "Rural areas would feel the largest impacts, Maher said. Local stations also provide vital alerts in emergencies like storms, floods and wildfires.",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News on July 17. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",

      "Kugler was nominated to serve as a governor by former President Joe Biden and has been in the role since September 2023. She filled an unexpired term set to end Jan. 31, according to the central bank. Kugler's resignation is effective Aug. 8. Kugler is returning to Georgetown University to serve as a professor, according to the Fed.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On the campaign trail, Donald Trump made a pledge: Under his leadership, in vitro fertilization would be covered for all women and couples seeking the treatment. \"We are going to be paying for that treatment,\" he said in an interview in August 2024.",
      "After taking office, President Trump signed an executive order directing his domestic policy council to make recommendations on IVF policy changes by May. But that deadline has come and gone, and the White House has said little about the issue. Advocates for better IVF coverage are wondering what the holdup is.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has called himself the \"father of IVF\" and claimed to be a \"leader on fertilization, IVF,\" told NBC News, during that 2024 interview, that IVF would be covered for everyone who needs it.",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,\" Mr. Trump, then a candidate, said. He added, \"We're going to be paying for that treatment, or we're gonna be mandating that the insurance company pay.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order, signed in February, fell short of his campaign pledge, stating that it would be administration policy \"to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.\"",
      "He directed his assistant for the White House Domestic Policy Council to submit within 90 days \"recommendations on protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.\"",
      "That deadline would have fallen on May 19. Asked for an update, the White House declined to comment.",
      "Cristina Gonzales and her partner, who live in New York City, have been struggling with infertility for about three years. Gonzales, who makes campaign ads for Democrats, is a part of a support group for women over 40 going through IVF. The women represent diverse political and ideological backgrounds, including liberals and those who support Mr. Trump, alike. When then-candidate Trump said IVF would be covered, Gonzales said some in her group \"believed completely and wholeheartedly\" that he would make coverage free.",
      "\"They deserve that promise to be kept,\" Gonzales said.",
      "\"This struggle of IVF is nonpartisan,\" she said. \"It affects everybody.\"",
      "In February, a Washington Post interview with Trump supporter and fired federal worker Ryleigh Cooper went viral. She said she didn't want to vote for Mr. Trump, but he'd promised to make IVF free. After reading the fact sheet from Mr. Trump's February executive order, she told the Post she said, \"'That's bullsh**.'\"",
      "IVF is a fertility treatment that has broad support; in 2023, over 95,000 babies were born as a result of IVF \u2014 about 2.6% of all births in the U.S. \u2014 according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",
      "An overwhelming majority of Americans \u2014 86% \u2014 think IVF should be legal, according to a March 2024 CBS News/YouGov poll.",
      "\"Eighty-six percent of Americans support IVF. That is unheard of in almost any issue you could think of in modern times,\" said Danielle Melfi, CEO of infertility advocacy nonprofit RESOLVE.",
      "According to an April 2024 Pew survey, 79% of Democrats and those who lean Democratic say access to IVF is a good thing, as do 63% of Republicans and those who lean Republican. Even among Americans who told Pew abortion should be illegal in most cases, 60% view IVF access positively.",
      "And Mr. Trump has introduced other concepts, including a \"baby bonus\" for babies born in the U.S., to help boost the U.S. birth rate. The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024, with fewer than 1.6 children being born per woman, according to new federal data. The bonus is available to parents who open so-called Trump Accounts, which were introduced in the president's massive domestic policy bill that he signed into law last month.",
      "Melfi is optimistic about the momentum the issue has picked up and has made recommendations to the White House, among them, to increase health insurance coverage of all fertility-related treatment, include fertility coverage for veterans and military families, and cover fertility care for all federal employees.",
      "Out-of-pocket costs are the biggest barrier to undergoing IVF, Melfi said. Each cycle \u2014 and many couples undergo several cycles \u2014 costs between $12,000 and $25,000. Very few states require insurance companies to provide coverage for the treatment, so the vast majority of women and couples must pay out of pocket for IVF rounds.",
      "\"Each state looks a little bit different, which is why action at the federal level would be really meaningful,\" Melfi said of state laws governing insurance coverage of IVF.",
      "IVF is one of multiple infertility treatments available, and is often the last \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 step women take to become pregnant.",
      "In the process, a woman typically administers expensive shots to herself every day to stimulate the growth of multiple eggs at once and regularly goes to a fertility clinic for ultrasounds and blood work to monitor progress. The eggs are retrieved, fertilized outside of the body and ideally, they develop into healthy embryos that can be implanted immediately or frozen for later use.",
      "Many find it to be an exhausting process \u2014 physically, emotionally and financially.",
      "Leading up to her first round of IVF, Gonzales was anxious. What if she and her partner were to spend all this money only for the procedure to not result in pregnancy?",
      "\"I don't have enough money for this and I feel like there's a lot of pressure on my body \u2014 what if it doesn't perform?\" she said.",
      "For her, an unexpected year-end bonus had provided a way to pay. But otherwise, it might not have been possible.",
      "\"When you look at health insurance policies, almost none of them cover fertility,\" Gonzales said. \"Even so-called progressive states.\"",
      "Still, IVF provides no guarantees. Gonzales has undergone four rounds of IVF, none of which resulted in a baby, and now, she and her partner are pursuing other paths to parenthood. IVF has ultimately been successful for other women in her IVF support group, and she thinks every person should have the chance to pursue the procedure, regardless of their financial circumstances.",
      "\"I don't regret it, I would definitely do it all over again,\" she said.",
      "Gonzales hopes the president follows through on his pledge to make sure IVF is covered for those who want and need it.",
      "\"It would be one of the smartest policies for them to actually make good on this promise,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE \u2014 ticked higher last month, signaling that President Trump's tariffs are pushing some prices higher.",
      "Prices rose 2.6% in June compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from an annual pace of 2.4% in May. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.8% in the past year, the same as the previous month, which was revised higher.",
      "The figures help illustrate the central bank's reason for\u00a0its decision Wednesday to keep its\u00a0key interest rate steady, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressing that inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. Powell suggested it could take months for the central bank to determine whether the president's new import duties would cause just a one-time rise in prices, or a more persistent increase in inflation.",
      "\"The Fed got validation this morning with inflation coming in a little higher than expected,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X in an emailed comment. \"There is some evidence of tariff impact in the inflation data, but it remains modest. Health care, housing and utilities continue to be key sources in driving inflation.\"",
      "On a monthly basis, prices ticked up 0.3% from May to June, while core prices also rose 0.3%. Both figures are higher than what would be consistent with the 2% target.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook and inflation that remains higher than its 2% annualized goal. The central bank last cut rates in December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's January inauguration.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pressuring Powell to cut rates, arguing that lower rates are justified because inflation remains tame and that other nations have been cutting their benchmark rates this year. Nevertheless, the majority of the Fed's 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, voted on Wednesday to maintain rates in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, although there were two dissenting votes in favor of a cut.",
      "The rise in the PCE's inflation data may lessen the likelihood of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, said Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.",
      "\"The above-target rise in core prices in June, upward revisions to previous months' data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed's concerns about tariff-driven inflation,\" Chambers said.",
      "Higher grocery and gas prices",
      "The government's measure of gas prices jumped 0.9% from May to June, while grocery costs rose 0.3%. Many longer-lasting goods that are heavily imported saw clear price increases, with furniture prices up 1.3% just last month, appliances up 1.9%, and computers up 1.4%.",
      "The cost of some services fell dramatically last month, offsetting some of the price pressures from goods. Air fares dropped 0.7% from May to June, while the cost of hotel rooms plunged 3.6% just in one month.",
      "Thursday's report also showed that consumer spending rose 0.3% from May to June, a modest rise that suggests Americans are still spending cautiously. Adjusted for inflation, the increase was just 0.1%, the government said.",
      "Americans' incomes also saw a modest increase, rising 0.3% last month, a rebound after a 0.4% drop in May. Adjusted for inflation and taxes, however, incomes were flat in June.",
      "Consumers have been cautious all year. On Wednesday, the government said the economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a solid showing but one that masked some red flags.",
      "Consumer spending, for example, rose at a lackluster 1.4% pace, after an even smaller gain of 0.5% in the first three months of the year. A sharp drop in imports in the April-June quarter, which followed a surge in the first quarter, provided a big lift to the government's calculation of U.S. gross domestic product.",

    "summary": "The EPA has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.",
      "Known as the \"endangerment finding,\" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, \"the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"",
      "Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.",
      "But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would \"repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"",
      "During his appearance on the \"Ruthless Podcast,\" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution.",
      "\"There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it \"is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,\" according to the EPA press release.",
      "But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits.",
      "Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA.",
      "\"For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,\" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. \"The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem.\"",
      "Legality of the endangerment finding",
      "In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health.",
      "Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations.",
      "\"I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,\" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government.",
      "\"This body of scientific evidence met the endangerment test of the Clean Air Act,\" they told CBS News. \"It has stood the test of time and the science has only gotten stronger.\"",
      "The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review.",
      "The release also said the EPA will \"update scientific data and challenge the assumptions\" of the 2009 finding with\u00a0a study\u00a0from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which was not peer-reviewed, but says greenhouse gases \"appear to be less damaging economically than commonly believed.\"",
      "Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement.",
      "\"Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement.",
      "The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.",
      "The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases \"have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,\" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA.",
      "\"The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\"",
      "Impacts of the endangerment finding",
      "Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA.",
      "New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates. The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits.",
      "But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, \"undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,\" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers.",
      "In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants, has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing.",
      "\"Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.",

      "That's right, a fruit. Potatoes and tomatoes don't look alike, smell alike or taste alike, but in a study published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists said that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor around 9 million years ago.",
      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",

And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",

      "Nearly three hours later, after doffing their spacesuits and configuring their capsule for docked operations, Fincke, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, Japanese veteran Kimiya Yui and rookie cosmonaut Oleg Platonov floated through the forward hatch to be welcomed aboard by the space station's seven-member crew.",
      "\"We are so happy to see your smiling faces,\" said ISS commander Takuya Onishi. \"Zena, Oleg, congratulations on your first spaceflight. We are looking forward to hearing your impressions and your feelings about that. Mike and Kimiya, welcome back. Your experience will be an invaluable asset for Expedition 73.\"",
      "Cardman was bumped from a Crew Dragon flight last year to help NASA bring two Starliner astronauts back to Earth after problems prevented them from coming home on their own spacecraft. She was clearly thrilled to finally be aboard the space station.",
      "\"This has been the absolute journey of a lifetime,\" she said with a broad smile. \"We are so incredibly grateful to be here. Thank you so much for this warm welcome. It was such an unbelievably beautiful sight to see the space station come into our view for the first time, especially with these wonderful crewmates.\"",
      "With the arrival of Crew 11, four of the station's crew members \u2014 Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 will be clear to undock and return to Earth next Wednesday to close out a 145-day mission.",
      "The other three \u2014 Kim and Soyuz MS-27/73S crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky \u2014 will remain aboard with Cardman and company to continue Expedition 73.",
      "Until now, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit with Crew 11.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25% while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money.",
      "No final decisions have been made. But NASA is assessing the possibility of extending Crew 11's stay in space from six to eight months, depending on the actual funding outlook.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" Cardman said before launch. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

    "story": [
      "Running a day late, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched Friday on a mission to deliver a fresh three-man one-woman crew to the International Space Station.",
      "The Falcon 9 lifted off at 11:43 a.m. EDT from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, as mission control kept a close eye on clouds rolling into the area shortly before launch time.",
      "With commander Zena Cardman and co-pilot Mike Fincke monitoring cockpit displays, flanked on the left by Japanese Astronaut Kimiya Yui and on the right by cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, the Crew Dragon capsule began its climb. Nine minutes later, they reached orbit and set off after the International Space Station.",
      "\"I have no emotions but joy right now. That was absolutely transcendent, the ride of a lifetime,\" radioed Cardman, making her first flight. \"Thank you, this has been an incredible honor.\"",
      "Added Fincke, a three-flight veteran: \"Boy, it's great to be back in orbit again! Thank you to SpaceX and NASA to get us here. What a ride!\"",
      "The crew\u00a0originally hoped to take off Thursday, but clouds built up over the launch site and SpaceX called off the countdown just 67 seconds before liftoff. Weather remained a concern the second time around, but in the end conditions were \"go\" for launch.",
      "Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the Falcon 9's first stage engines shut down, the stage dropped away and the flight to orbit continued on the power of the single Merlin engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around and reversed course, flying itself back to a picture-perfect touchdown on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, chalking up SpaceX's 65th Florida landing and its 484th successful booster recovery overall.",
      "One minute after landing, the second stage engine shut down and the Crew Dragon Endeavour was released to fly on its own.",
      "Had the crew launched Thursday, it would have taken them nearly 40 hours to catch up with the space station. With a launch Friday, the trip was expected to take just 16 hours, setting up a docking at the forward Harmony module's space-facing port at 3 a.m. Saturday \u2014 the same time they would have docked had they launched Thursday.",
      "For Cardman, the trip to space finally fulfills a dream she had hoped to accomplish last year when she came within a month or so of launching to the space station as commander of an earlier Crew Dragon flight.",
      "But she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex in June 2024 in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "Wilson has not yet been assigned another flight, but Cardman was tapped to command of Crew 11.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" she said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Fincke is a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "Platonov, making his first flight, was assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program. The arrangement is intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it.",
      "Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under the agreement.",
      "A long-awaited mission aboard the space station",
      "Crew 11 will be welcomed aboard the space station by by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand: Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Clothing and personal items for Cardman are already on board, launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, her 38th, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",
      "Said departing Crew 10 commander McClain: \"We feel very safe.\"",

      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "In July alone, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/yogurt-shop-murders-are-two-never-identified-customers-key-to-solving-austin-texas-case/",
    "published": "Sat, 02 Aug 2025 22:53:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Two men were seen in a Texas yogurt shop just before four teenage girls were killed there in 1991, and some wonder whether identifying them will lead to answers in the unsolved case.",
    "story": [
      "[This story was originally posted on February 5, 2022. It was updated on August 27.]",
      "It has been more than 30 years since four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop and the case remains unsolved. At one point, there were arrests and then convictions, but those convictions were later overturned on appeal, and ultimately, new DNA technology raised doubts about the involvement of those initial arrestees.",
      "The case has left investigators at what appears to be a standstill, but as correspondent Erin Moriarty reported in this week's \"48 Hours,\" there is a theory that two never-identified men seen in the yogurt shop on the night of the murders may have been involved in the unsolved killings that have haunted Austin for decades.",
      "On December 6, 1991, 17-year-old Eliza Thomas, 13-year-old Amy Ayers, and two sisters, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison and 15-year-old Sarah Harbison, were tied up and shot in the head in an \"I Can't Believe It's Yogurt!\" shop in Austin.",
      "The city had never seen a crime quite like it. Eliza and Jennifer had been working in the yogurt shop that night. They were getting ready to close when Jennifer's sister, Sarah, and their friend, Amy, met them there to head home. Investigators believe at least two men entered the shop and committed the brutal crime before setting the place on fire, destroying much of the evidence.",
      "John Jones worked for the Austin Police Department at the time of the crime and was the lead investigator on the case. He has since retired. Jones told Moriarty that as part of the early investigation, he and his team tracked down customers who were in the yogurt shop on the day of the crime to see if they noticed anything suspicious. According to Jones, multiple customers described two men who \"looked out of place\" sitting in the shop just before it was due to close. Neither man was reported to have purchased frozen yogurt \u2014 instead, only a drink.",
      "\"They never have been identified. And we did everything. \u2026 We even hypnotized some folks,\" Jones told Moriarty.",
      "Despite investigators' efforts, that lead went nowhere and eventually the case went cold. Then, in 1999, nearly eight years after the murders, there was a break in the case when new investigators decided to re-examine a different old lead.",
      "Robert Springsteen, Michael Scott, Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn were only teenagers at the time of the crime. They, too, had landed on Jones' radar early on after one of them, Maurice Pierce, was arrested with a gun at a mall near the yogurt shop in the days after the crime. Back then, the men were questioned by Jones and his team but were subsequently released for lack of evidence.",
      "In 1999, the new investigators decided to re-question the men. Two of them, Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott, confessed to the yogurt shop murders and implicated Pierce and Welborn in the process. All four men were subsequently arrested.",
      "But it wasn't long before Springsteen and Scott recanted their confessions, saying they were coerced. Charges were ultimately dropped against Pierce and Welborn due to lack of evidence.",
      "Springsteen and Scott were the only two to go on trial. They were both convicted, but years later, their convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers and in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Prosecutors intended to retry Springsteen and Scott, but before doing so, they ordered DNA tests on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. By this point, investigators had come to believe at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted, and prosecutors wanted to take advantage of a fairly new type of DNA testing called Y-STR testing. It searches for male DNA only.",
      "No one expected what it would reveal. As a result of the testing, a partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the victims, but to the surprise of the prosecutor's office, the DNA sample did not match any of the four men who had been arrested. Charges were dropped against Springsteen and Scott, and they were released from prison after spending 10 years behind bars.",
      "Attorney Amber Farrelly worked on both Scott and Springsteen's defense teams. She is adamant that police had it all wrong when they arrested Scott, Springsteen, Welborn and Pierce. She told \"48 Hours\" she believes those two unidentified customers from the yogurt shop are who police should really be fixated on.",
      "While working on Scott and Springsteen's defense teams, Farrelly was tasked with sifting through old police records, including those interviews Jones and his colleagues had conducted with customers who visited the yogurt shop on the day of the murders.",
      "\"They (police) have accounted for and interviewed 52 people that were in the yogurt shop that day,\" Farrelly told \"48 Hours'\" Erin Moriarty.",
      "Farrelly says several of those customers mentioned the two men who were seen sitting in the yogurt shop just before it was due to close that night.",
      "\"We have no names to them. And when you look at \u2014 when you step back and you look and you think, 'They've talked to 52 people and didn't miss one person from 4:30 until 11:00 at night. And several people talk about a guy or two guys, and they describe them in the same manner? And we don't know who those two guys are? And they've never called in? \u2026 That raises, in my opinion, the suspicion\u2026 that these are the gentlemen who did it,\" Farrelly said.",
      "\"Were those two men who've never been identified the last people in the yogurt shop, as far as you know?\" Moriarty asked Farrelly.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Farrelly responded.",
      "Farrelly says the men were described as \"kind of leaned over the table, talking to each other and kind of whispering, like they didn't want anybody to hear what they were saying.\"",
      "She says that one of the men was described as having light, short hair, \"like a dirty blonde,\" and was said to have been about 5'6\" tall and in his late 20s or early 30s. She says the other man was described as being \"bigger,\" and both were observed wearing big coats. One, she says, is thought to have had a green \"Army fatigue kind of looking jacket\" and the other is thought to have had a black jacket. According to Farrelly, the men are believed to have been driving a green car that evening.",
      "John Jones, the former lead investigator on the case, is still haunted by the unsolved yogurt shop murders even though he has long retired. He told \"48 Hours\" he still wonders about those unidentified customers.",
      "\"Yeah, it's kind of a question to me that to this day, they haven't been identified,\" he said. \"Is that evidence that they did it? No, but that's evidence that we really need to talk to them.\"",
      "If you have information about the yogurt shop murders, call 512-472-TIPS."

    "story": [
      "This story previously aired on\u00a0 Aug. 27, 2022.",
      "More than three decades ago, four teenage girls were brutally murdered in an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop in Austin, Texas. The horrific crime has haunted their families, the city, and the investigators who chased every lead in the case to a dead end. Could new information finally help solve the case?",
      "\"I can see them, I can still see the inside of that place,\" John Jones, the first investigator on the case, tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty. \"That stuff's \u2026 indelibly burned in my mind.\"",
      "The story starts on Dec. 6, 1991, when Eliza Thomas, Sarah and Jennifer Harbison and Amy Ayers were tied up and shot. The yogurt shop was then set on fire. For decades, investigators worked to find suspects. There were eventually arrests and even convictions. But those convictions were overturned, leaving the case unsolved today.",
      "\"There is a kind of torture that continues by the fact that it's unsolved and it's ongoing,\" says Sonora Thomas, who was 13 when her sister Eliza was killed.",
      "\"It's always there,\" says Jones.",
      "There may be some positive news, however. A small sample of male DNA was found on one of the victims. With DNA research advancing, investigators hope there will be a match that solves the case.",
      "\"Do you believe that there is right now, some evidence that could lead to the killers?\" Moriarty asks Texas defense attorney Joe James Sawyer.",
      "\"Yes,\" Sawyer says.",
      "\"Is this the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end?\" Jones asks.",
      "THE SEARCH FOR ANSWERS",
      "It's been more than 30 years since John Jones began the painstaking search for the killers of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop.",
      "He has long since retired from the Austin Police Department and moved out of Texas. But copies of some of the case files moved with him.",
      "Erin Moriarty [with Jones in his home office]: What is all of this here?",
      "John Jones: These are my notes. \u2026 Oh, that's the big book \u2026 this one is really from day 1 \u2026 hypnosis, polygraph, confessions.",
      "Erin Moriarty: (picks up coffee mug) You know, I notice this sitting here.",
      "John Jones: Yeah.",
      "Erin Moriarty (reads coffee mug): \"We will not forget.\" You haven't.",
      "John Jones: Nope. I can't.",
      "The images of Dec. 6, 1991, remain all too vivid.",
      "John Jones: I can definitely still see it.",
      "It started with that call from dispatch to go to a scene of a fire, that would turn into something far worse:",
      "JOHN JONES: What do you'll got out there?\u00a0 I'm en route \u2026 airport 35.",
      "DISPATCH: We've got a fire \u2026",
      "JOHN JONES (1991 on radio): OK. I'm copying the fire part, but you cut out on the first part of that though.",
      "DISPATCH: \u2026 apparently a robbery and homicide. There's, uh, three fatalities.",
      "JOHN JONES: That's 10-4, we're en route (turns on siren).",
      "John Jones: And then about halfway out there, they call again on the radio and said we found a fourth body.",
      "A local TV news crew happened to be filming Jones on a ride along that night.",
      "JOHN JONES (on radio): What place of business is this at?",
      "DISPATCH: It's the I Can't Believe It's Yogurt.",
      "JOHN JONES: OK.",
      "John Jones: The fire department had just knocked down the fire. \u2026 there was still a lot of water in there \u2026\u00a0 a lot of smoke still. \u2026 it was all muted grays, blacks there was no color in there with the exception of the girls.",
      "The girls were quickly identified. Two had been working at the shop, closing up that night: Eliza Thomas and Jennifer Harbison were both 17 years old.\u00a0 Jennifer's 15-year-old sister, Sarah, and their friend, 13-year-old Amy Ayers, had met them there to head home.",
      "The four girls had been gagged, tied up with their own clothing, and shot in the head. Investigators would learn at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted. The yogurt shop had also been set on fire, destroying potential evidence.",
      "John Jones: There was smoke and soot on every surface, kind of made fingerprinting kind of difficult.",
      "This was a crime like none Austin had seen before. Jones knew he needed help, and from the scene, contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, The FBI, and Texas Department of Public Safety.",
      "John Jones: As soon as we knew what type of guns we were looking for, that information went out nationwide.",
      "Gunshot wounds showed that two different types of guns were used, leading investigators to believe there were at least two killers on the loose.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What were the two guns?",
      "John Jones: .380 and a .22. \u2026 And we recovered all of the rounds.",
      "The weapons, though, were not found, and a task force worked to come up with potential suspects.",
      "John Jones: They were from all spectrums. I mean, we looked at everybody from family members to drifters.",
      "And while police tracked down leads, the families and the City of Austin grieved.",
      "The Harbison family lost their only children: daughters Jennifer, a hard-working high school senior, and Sarah, who was enjoying sports and clubs as a high school freshman. Their mother, Barbara, spoke with \"48 Hours\" in 1992.",
      "Barbara Harbison: My life was focused around them from here to eternity. Someone took eternity away from me.",
      "Bob Ayers is the father of the youngest victim, Amy, a country girl with a love for animals.",
      "Bob Ayers: I lost my daughter.\u00a0 I lost my first dance.\u00a0 \u2026 I won't see her graduate. I won't see her become a veterinarian. \u2026 She was a Daddy's girl.",
      "Sonora Thomas, 13 years old when her only sibling, Eliza, was murdered, had a hard time dealing with the loss of the sister she looked up to.",
      "Sonora Thomas: I remember the shock \u2026 I remember fantasizing for days that my sister had somehow escaped and run away and \u2026 she was going to come back \u2026 And so that's what I was kind of holding onto.",
      "Her parents struggled as well.",
      "Sonora Thomas: My family never talked about my sister after she died.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Never?",
      "Sonora Thomas: No. It's too, it's too painful.",
      "Sonora did as best she could, picking up some pieces of her sister's life. Eliza, an animal lover, had a pig she planned to enter in livestock show. Just a few months after the murders, Sonora took over those duties.",
      "While Sonora may have seemed to be coping, the reality, she says, was far different.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You had to grow up quickly.",
      "Sonora Thomas: Very quickly \u2026 I would say I fell apart under that pressure.",
      "John Jones: We knew they were hurting because, you know, we were hurting too.",
      "Jones, a parent himself, felt the families' grief. He promised to do all he could to help them.",
      "John Jones: We told them what we could. And \u2026 I assured them that we would keep them apprised as to everything that was happening, and we did.",
      "Jones also made a pledge to the families involving the shirt he wore on the night of the murders.",
      "John Jones: I kind of made a promise to them \u2026 that the next time they saw me with that green and white shirt on that that was a signal to them that, you know, we knew who did it.",
      "And Jones seemed assured they would find the killers.",
      "John Jones: We stayed in constant contact with the behavioral science unit at the FBI in Quantico \u2026 they said that I should, as the face of the investigation, I should project an air of confidence \u2026 that would cause the bad guy to shiver in his boots. \u2026 So look in the camera and be confident.",
      "And, when we followed him working the case in 1992, he did just that.",
      "JOHN JONES: Let me just say this, whoever you are out there, you are going to be mine one of these days\u2026.",
      "But trying to figure that out was daunting.",
      "John Jones (at police station in 1992): 342 people that have been listed as suspects, but we're looking at pages and pages of suspects here.",
      "One of those early suspects was a teenager named Maurice Pierce. He was arrested eight days after the murders at a mall near the yogurt shop, carrying a .22 caliber gun, the type used in the murders.",
      "John Jones: The .22s were unmatchable.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, you can't say it wasn't his gun? But there was no way to match it.",
      "John Jones: No.",
      "Erin Moriarty: But there was no way to match it.",
      "John Jones: \u2014 to prove that it was his gun. He gave a statement, matter of fact, I took his statement. And he implicated three other boys.",
      "Jones says Maurice Pierce claimed he was driving a getaway car and that three acquaintances, Forrest Welborn, Michael Scott and Robert Springsteen, were involved in the murders. But Pierce's story began to fall apart.",
      "John Jones: It started to crater when we wired him up to go talk to Forest. And we were listening in on the wire, and it was pretty obvious Forest didn't know what Maurice was talking about.",
      "And when Welborn, Scott and Springsteen were brought in for questioning, they too denied any involvement. It was decided there was not enough evidence to charge them and the search for other suspects continued.",
      "CHASING LEADS",
      "Two months after the yogurt shop murders, with no viable suspects, police were chasing leads \u2014 no matter where it took them.",
      "The task force became aware of a counter-culture type group of local residents known to be into the supernatural.",
      "DET. MIKE HUCKABAY [at roundtable, 1992]: They're into vampires, the occult, graveyard rites. \u2026 They go out and dance and take pictures on tombstones.",
      "And investigators began to hear that this group might be connected to something far more serious.",
      "John Jones (2021): The \u2014 the tips were that they were talking about the murders.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Talking about the yogurt shop murders.",
      "John Jones: The yogurt shop murders, yes.",
      "There was one woman in particular whose name kept coming up in connection with these tips. The task force planned a raid on her home, hoping to see if any evidence might be found there.",
      "John Jones: It was creepy in there.",
      "John Jones: But as it turns out, a lot of that stuff was rat bones and theatrical parts. But \u2026 it was a good lead. \u2026 Till we finally figured out that, uh, they're just living a make-believe life (shaking his head).",
      "The raid may have been a bust, but it wasn't long before the task force had its eyes on another person of interest. A police sketch shows a man that multiple eyewitnesses told police they saw sitting in a car outside the yogurt shop on the night of the murders.",
      "John Jones: And it was somebody we really wanted to talk to. \u2026 So, we put it out there.",
      "And the response they got came from an unexpected source.",
      "John Jones: A couple of other investigators from the Sex Crimes Unit came up and go \u2026 \"We have a sketch that looks just like that.\"",
      "Three\u00a0weeks before the yogurt shop murders, a young woman in Austin had been kidnapped and sexually assaulted. Police had released a sketch of three men wanted in connection with that crime. One of those suspects bore a striking resemblance to that man witnesses reported sitting in a car outside the yogurt shop.",
      "John Jones: You know, I just kind of went zip when I saw the \u2014 the composite.",
      "A tip came in that the men wanted in the kidnapping and sexual assault case had fled to Mexico. Two were caught and arrested; one who resembled the person of interest in the yogurt shop sketch. The development made national news.",
      "John Jones: When they got caught in Mexico, we went down there ... to interview them. Jones' team questioned the men. And so, too, did the Mexican authorities.",
      "John Jones: But the Mexican government \u2026 announced to the whole world that \u2026 they confessed, and they were going to try them for the murders down there.",
      "Erin Moriarty: They confessed to the yogurt shop murders?",
      "John Jones: Yes, they did.",
      "But Jones learned those confessions had details that didn't match the crime scene. Even the caliber of guns they claimed to use was wrong.",
      "John Jones:\u00a0 There were too many inconsistencies in the \u2026 confession.",
      "So, Jones' team reinterviewed the men, and he says this time they recanted just about everything. It made Jones and the other investigators wonder if those confessions were coerced by the Mexican authorities. The once promising lead fell apart .",
      "John Jones: (exhales) It was depressing.",
      "Over the following years, there would be other confessions, ones that were willingly given.",
      "John Jones: You know, we faced six confessions.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Six people who confessed?",
      "John Jones: Yeah. Written.",
      "Erin Moriarty: That confessed to this crime?",
      "John Jones: Yes, they did.",
      "Erin Moriarty: And they didn't do it?",
      "John Jones:\u00a0Nope.",
      "In 1994, after nearly three years of leading the investigation, John Jones was moved out of the homicide division. He says it was a mutual decision. Austin Police wanted fresh eyes working the case, and Jones felt it was time to move on. Other detectives took over and, as time passed, the victims' families were left wondering why no one had been arrested. Amy Ayers' mother Pam spoke to \"48 Hours\" in 1996.",
      "Pam Ayers [fighting back tears]: They're probably out there leading a life as normal as they've ever had. And ours is never going to be the same.",
      "That same year, Eliza Thomas' mom moved away from Austin \u2026 and the painful reminders.",
      "Maria Thomas (1996): Running into people who were constantly asking how the case was going was very hard on me, and especially my daughter Sonora.",
      "Sonora's life had taken a downward spiral.",
      "Sonora Thomas: In my high school years, things really deteriorated. \u2026 Drugs, using alcohol, being hospitalized, going to a boarding school for, you know, disturbed teenagers, things like that.",
      "The case seemed stalled, until October 1999.",
      "RADIO NEWS REPORT: Some breaking news \u2014 Austin police have arrested four men in connection with the yogurt shop murders of 1991.",
      "There were finally arrests, but would it answer the question on the billboard that had been haunting Austin for nearly a decade?",
      "SUSPECTS ARRESTED",

      "MAYOR KIRK WATSON (at 1999 press conference): I want to start off by thanking y'all for joining us here today. \u2026 For almost eight years, we've all waited to hear the words that our police department is close to a point of solving a crime that has haunted our very souls. \u2026 Today, we finally get to hear those words.",
      "When four men were arrested in the fall of 1999 for the yogurt shop murders, relief was felt citywide.",
      "MAYOR KIRK WATSON (at press conference): Sarah, Jennifer, Amy, Eliza, we did not forget.",
      "The girls' families struggled to take it all in.",
      "Sonora Thomas: There had been so many false leads for such a long time. It was hard to know how to think about it and how to feel about it.",
      "But there were finally names and faces to blame: Maurice Pierce, Forrest Welborn, Michael Scott and Robert Springsteen. To the task force, they were familiar names and faces. They were the same young men that John Jones and his investigators questioned just eight days after the murders and ultimately released for lack of evidence.",
      "John Jones: I was confident and remain confident to this day that we got as far with them as we could then. But that doesn't mean that \u2026 there wasn't something developed later that would cause them to actually go out and arrest them. So, I was going, \"yes, good job.\" \u2026 \u00a0I was ready to dig out the hideous green and white shirt.",
      "But before that shirt could come out of the closet\u2014the one he promised the girls' families he would wear when the case was solved \u2014 Jones wanted to know more about what led to the arrests.",
      "Joe James Sawyer: There was no physical evidence. Nothing.",
      "Joe James Sawyer was appointed as Robert Springsteen's attorney.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What made them go back and charge these guys?",
      "Joe James Sawyer: Because the new officers, when they reopened the cold case, convinced themselves that \"we let them slip through our fingers. We had to have had the murderers in the beginning.\" In part, they decided that because they had nothing else.",
      "There was no new physical evidence suddenly tying any of the four men to the crime, but what police did have were two newly obtained confessions\u2014 one from Michael Scott and another from Sawyer's own client, Robert Springsteen. Michael Scott's confession came first. He was questioned over four days:",
      "OFFICER (1999 interrogation): Come on Michael, you're doing good. Tell us. Let's do this today. Let's do it.",
      "MICHAEL SCOTT: I remember seeing girls. \u2026 I remember one girl screaming, terrified.",
      "Scott told investigators that he and the others only intended a simple robbery. He said they cased the yogurt shop earlier that day. And then, after dark, he said, they came back armed with two guns.",
      "MICHAEL SCOTT (interrogation): I hear the gun go off. I only pulled the trigger once\u2026. I hear another gun go off.",
      "Investigators claimed that Springsteen later corroborated much of what Scott said. But after intense questioning, he went further.",
      "OFFICER (interrogation): You f------g know if you f------g raped her, just say it.",
      "ROBERT SPRINGSTEEN: I stuck my d--- in her p---- and I raped her.",
      "Springsteen told them he shot one girl and raped her.",
      "Joe James Sawyer: He was so tired of this. He'd already been questioned. He'd already been through that mill. He thought, you know what? I'll tell you any damn thing you want.",
      "Sawyer maintains his client is innocent and says the confession was coerced. In 2009, Robert Springsteen explained to \"48 Hours\" why he would admit to doing something so horrible\u2014something he says he didn't do.",
      "Robert Springsteen: I was berated and berated and berated by the police officers. Until they obtained what it was they wanted to hear, they were not going to allow me to leave. And I basically\u2014 they broke me down.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Let me just ask you, did you have anything to do\u2014",
      "Robert Springsteen: No. I did not.",
      "Erin Moriarty: \u2014 with the murders at the yogurt shop?",
      "Robert Springsteen: No. Never.",
      "Even though Joe James Sawyer didn't have Michael Scott as his client, he says he has serious concerns about his confession, too.",
      "OFFICER (INTERROGATION): Is that the gun you shot somebody with, Mike? Is that the gun you walked up behind somebody with and shot in the head?",
      "Joe James Sawyer: I frankly couldn't believe it. \u2026 They terrorized him. And he was afraid to say no.",
      "Forrest Welborn denied having anything to do with the murders, but police were convinced he was the lookout that night and Michael Scott placed him at the scene. Erin Moriarty spoke to Welborn in 1999 in jail shortly after his arrest.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you there that night?",
      "Forrest Welborn: No.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Were you there as a lookout?",
      "Forrest Welborn: No. I'm innocent.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You had nothing to do with this?",
      "Forrest Welborn: Nothing at all.",
      "Welborn had been questioned multiple times by investigators over the years, and he never wavered. He, like the others, first came on police radar when, in 1991, just days after the murders, Maurice Pierce had been caught with that .22 caliber gun at the mall near the yogurt shop. Pierce told the detectives back then that he had given the handgun to Welborn and that it had been used in the yogurt shop murders.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why would he say that?",
      "Forrest Welborn: I don't know.",
      "Welborn has always maintained his innocence despite pressure from the police.",
      "Forrest Welborn: They would get right in my face and, you know, tell me everything I said was a lie.",
      "Remember, false confessions in this case were nothing new. Jones said that six written false confessions were obtained when he was in charge. So, when he learned that the two confessions were all the new investigators seemed to have, it gave him pause.",
      "John Jones: I go, well, maybe I shouldn't get that shirt out just yet.",
      "It wasn't long before the case against the men began crumbling. Charges against Forrest Welborn were dismissed after two grand juries failed to indict him. And later on, charges were dropped against Maurice Pierce for lack of evidence. Everything fell apart except the cases against Michael Scott and Robert Springsteen. And with Scott and Springsteen's confessions, the victims' families felt prosecutors had a strong case.",
      "Barbara Ayres-Wilson (outside courthouse, 2010): These young men have been implicated and they have confessed. And they can withdraw it, but the truth is, they actually were there, and they actually did the murders.",
      "A DNA BREAKTHROUGH?",
      "In 2001, nearly 10 years after the murders of Eliza Thomas, Amy Ayers and Sarah and Jennifer Harbison, the yogurt shop murder trials began. Both defendants \u2014 Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott \u2014 faced the death penalty.",
      "Joe James Sawyer: The only thing that ever tied Robert or Mike Scott to that crime scene were their confessions.",
      "Confessions that both defendants said were coerced. The two were tried separately. Springsteen's trial was first. Neither of the men would testify against one another. So instead, prosecutors used their confessions against one another, reading parts of the confessions to the juries. Springsteen's lawyer, Joe James Sawyer, was frustrated that he couldn't cross-examine Scott.",
      "Joe James Sawyer: I thought the trial was massively unfair to my client and that it was being done systematically and with deliberation.",
      "The trial lasted three weeks. The jury deliberated for 13 hours and then, reached a verdict.",
      "JURY FOREPERSON: We the jury find the defendant Robert Springsteen IV guilty of the offense of capital murder \u2026",
      "Guilty. Springsteen was condemned to death row.",
      "In 2002, Michael Scott went on trial. He was convicted as well. He was sentenced to life in prison. But the case didn't end there. Fifteen years after the murders, came a shocking turn of events.",
      "NEWS REPORT: In a 5-4 decision, the court behind me said that Michael Scott's constitutional rights were violated during his trial and therefore should get a new one.",
      "Both Scott and Springsteen's convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers \u2014 and remember, in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Joe James Sawyer: And the relief \u2026 the relief was incredible.",
      "But that relief for the defendants came as a devastating blow to the victims' families. We later spoke to Eliza Thomas' mother, Maria, about that moment.",

      "Even though their convictions were overturned, Scott and Springsteen were not released. A new district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, was determined to retry them. In an effort to find more evidence, her office had ordered DNA tests on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. It's called Y-STR testing \u2014 and was fairly new in 2009 when \"48 Hours\" spoke with D.A. Lehmberg.",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg: This technology searches for male DNA only",
      "A partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the victims believed to have been sexually assaulted. And no one expected what it would reveal.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Does that DNA match any of the four young men who were originally accused and two of them who've been convicted?",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg: It does not.",
      "The DNA did not match any of the original four suspects, including Scott and Springsteen.\u00a0 And that's significant because Springsteen, in that confession he said was coerced, told investigators he raped one the girls.",
      "CeCe Moore is a DNA expert and genetic genealogist whom we asked about the case and the role of Y-STR DNA in criminal cases.",
      "CeCe Moore: It is a tool that can eliminate almost everyone \u2026 It should eliminate everybody but the suspect.",
      "Erin Moriarty: If their Y-STR does not match, they did not contribute that DNA?",
      "CeCe Moore: Because of \u2026 where that DNA was found, yes, in this case, it's very important.",
      "The district attorney was focused on finding the source of that DNA \u2014 she wondered if Springsteen and Scott had another partner.",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg: I remain really confident that \u2026 both Springsteen and Scott were responsible for killing those four girls.",
      "But in 2009, with no matches on that DNA, Lehmberg dropped charges against Springsteen and Scott. After nearly 10 years behind bars, they were released \u2014 but not exonerated, leaving open the possibility they could be retried at a later time.",
      "ROSEMARY LEHMBERG (at press conference): This was a difficult decision and one I'd rather not have to make.",

      "Amber Farrelly: Those two men were described wearing fatigued-colored jackets. \u2026They were very slouched over, whispering, like they were \u2014 it was a very close conversation in a booth.",
      "Officials tried to track down those two men as well as the source of the DNA. And then, in 2017, an Austin police investigator searched a public online DNA database to see if he could get a hit. And, unbelievably, he did.",
      "Michael McCaul: I thought, my God, we actually have a chance, a shot to solve this crime after so many years.",
      "WHO KILLED THESE GIRLS?",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: I really thought this was it - \u00a0 I really thought we had a chance to solve it.",
      "United States Congressman Michael McCaul, like so many others from Austin, hoped that the recently uncovered DNA in the Yogurt Shop murder case might finally bring answers to the victims' families.",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: We'll never forget that tragic day. It's stained in my memory.",
      "Twenty-five years after the murders, the Austin Police Department went searching for a match to the Y-STR DNA that had been found on the yogurt shop victim believed to have been sexually assaulted. And, in 2017, they got a break. On a public DNA database used for population studies, investigators thought they had found a match.",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: I've seen DNA \u2026 prove homicide cases. \u2026 the DNA evidence is really the key here.",
      "But that sample from the crime scene was not a complete DNA profile, it was just Y-STR \u2014 the male portion of DNA. And, it was not a very detailed sample, having just 16 markers.",
      "CeCe Moore: Sixteen STR's is not a very powerful match \u2026 there could be millions of people with that same profile \u2026 So, in genetic genealogy \u2026 We usually use 67 or 111 markers, or maybe even more.",
      "Erin Moriarty: But isn't it a place to start?",
      "CeCe Moore: It is \u2026 \u00a0It's not absolute, but if there's nothing else to work with, it is certainly something to look into.",
      "Still, it seemed to be the most promising lead in years.\u00a0 But there was a problem: the seemingly matching sample on the public database had been submitted anonymously by the FBI. It belonged to a federally convicted offender, arrestee, or detainee, but had no name attached to it.\u00a0 When Austin authorities tried to get a name, the FBI would not provide it, citing privacy laws.",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: There are some restrictions on privacy \u2026 And so, it gets into some very sort of, dicey issues.",
      "Frustrated, officials reached out to Congressman McCaul for help.",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: And so, I pressed the FBI very hard.",
      "Finally, in early 2020, the FBI agreed to work with the Austin Police Department to see if further testing could be done on that Y-STR DNA from the crime scene.",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: I was very excited about it. The idea that we could bring this case to closure for the families and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "More advanced testing came up with additional markers: 25 instead of the original 16. But as so often happened in this case, what seemed so promising, turned into disappointment.",
      "Some of the additional markers did not match the FBI sample. In other words, what seemed to be a match, was not. In a letter to Congressman McCaul, the FBI explained the new results \"conclusively exclude the male donor of the FBI's sample \u2026 as such, the FBI Y-STR profile is not an investigative lead.\"",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: And that was the greatest disappointment because we really thought we had it.",
      "Erin Moriarty: If it didn't match that individual, doesn't it still mean there's somebody out there \u2014 this DNA belongs to somebody, right?",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: It does. It does. And that's why we're not going to rest till we find the match.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How important then, is this DNA profile that exists \u2026 to solving this case?",
      "Congressman Michael McCaul: I mean, it's everything.",
      "With DNA research advancing so quickly, there is real hope that one day, that sample of DNA obtained 31 years ago, may finally solve this case. Still, it will not erase the pain or loss of lives.",
      "Sonora Thomas: Every year that goes by, I get farther and farther away from my sister, yeah. And I worry about losing memories.",
      "Sonora Thomas struggled for years with panic attacks and physical pain, until, with the help of therapy, she realized it was connected to the murder of her sister Eliza. With a unique understanding of what trauma victims experience, Sonora wanted to help others like her, and became a therapist.",

      "John Jones (shaking his head): It's always there.",
      "John Jones is still haunted by the fact that the case is unsolved, and by what he saw that gruesome night. He has suffered from PTSD through the years.",

      "Erin Moriarty: It took a toll on you, didn't it John, even 30 years afterwards?",
      "John Jones: Well, yeah. It would on anybody, I think \u2014 not as much as the families, you understand.",

    "story": [
      "This story was originally posted in Aug. 11, 2017. It was updated on Aug. 2, 2025.",
      "Shayna Glassman knows her family does not want her to write and visit with David Berkowitz, the infamous \"Son of Sam\" serial killer. \"My family told me, 'Shayna \u2014 don't pursue this,'\" she said.",
      "And she certainly knows how her deceased father would feel. \"A relative told me, 'Your dad would be so mad at you,'\" Shayna Glassman said.",
      "But more than anything, she is painfully aware that she's Berkowitz' \"type.\"",
      "\"I would have been his prime target,\" she told CBS News in 2017. \"I'm a young, attractive long-haired female and I'm the daughter of the person he thought was the devil. There's gotta be some deep psychological thing happening between us.\"",
      "Still, none of that stops Shayna Glassman from writing and visiting Berkowitz, an inmate at a maximum security prison in upstate New York. He's been incarcerated for nearly 50 years for shooting and killing six New Yorkers and wounding seven others in a murderous spree that's terrorized the city in 1976 and 1977.",
      "\"There was something deeper I needed to get,\" Shayna Glassman explained. \"It's my way of being with my father. The one thing he left me was this story.\"",
      "In 1977, Shayna's father, Craig Glassman, lived in apartment 6E at 35 Pine Street in Yonkers. His direct upstairs neighbor was Berkowitz, then a young postal worker.",
      "Craig Glassman was a nursing student and a volunteer deputy sheriff with the Westchester County Sheriff's Office. He often wore his police uniform which is why Shayna Glassman believed Berkowitz focused on him and came to hate him.",
      "Craig Glassman's full story was told in a 1990 now-out-of-print book titled \"Off The Wall.\" Part of the reason for the title are the writings police found on Berkowitz' apartment walls, some of them referencing \"Craig.\" The \"Son of Sam\" also mentioned \"Craig\" in a letter to police when he wrote: \"Because Craig is Craig so must the streets be filled with Craig (death).\"",
      "It was back in the summer of '77 \u2014 known locally as the Summer of Sam \u2014 when Craig Glassman began to get threatening letters. They were written in script and did not appear similar to the printed letters Berkowitz sent to the police and New York Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin.",
      "\"One of them had a drawing of a volcano,\" Shayna Glassman said. All of the letters were taken by New York City police after Berkowitz was arrested.",
      "At the time, Craig Glassman did not know who was sending the letters but he suspected Berkowitz because he often heard his upstairs neighbor pacing and one time received an angry phone call to shut off his television.",
      "The most serious incident occurred on Aug. 6, 1977, when someone left a bucket filled with gunpowder and .22 caliber bullets outside Craig Glassman's door and set it on fire. \"Dad heard the flames and thought the building was on fire,\" Shayna Glassman said. \"He called out to neighbors who called the fire department.\"",
      "The bullets never exploded but Craig Glassman filed a harassment complaint against Berkowitz and Shayna Glassman said. he told buddies on the force that he thought his crazy upstairs neighbor could be the \"Son of Sam.\" Of course, a lot of people that year felt someone they knew might be the killer; police were inundated with tips and leads.",
      "Days later, NYPD detectives appeared at 35 Pine Street and asked a shocked Craig Glassman if he was David Berkowitz. It was the pre-internet, pre-Facebook era. Police had gotten Berkowitz' name and address from a parking ticket at the scene of the last shooting, but had no idea what he looked like.",
      "\"Dad said, 'I can show you who he is,'\" Shayna Glassman recalled. \"He was sitting with them waiting for Berkowitz to come out and when he did, my father pulled his gun out and said, 'Freeze \u2014 put your hands up.' He rode with them in car with Berkowitz and he said, 'You're Craig Glassman.'\"",
      "While Craig Glassman was promoting his book in 1990, he died and left behind a suitcase with the information he'd collected on \"Son of Sam.\" Shayna Glassman was then only 4, but she says she always took a keen interest in the killer.",
      "\"It's my way of being with my father,\" she told CBS News. \"The one thing he left me was this story.\"",
      "In December 2016, Shayna Glassman began writing to Berkowitz and eventually showed up to visit him unannounced. She was allowed in and, when he walked to a seat two feet away from her, not separated by glass, she introduced herself. \"He said 'Shayna so good to see you,'\" she said. \"'So sorry to hear about your dad.'\"",
      "They spoke for more than two hours, she said, and, since then, she's visited him three more times. She even bought a manual typewriter to write letters to him \"because I wanted to get into his mind.\"",
      "Asked if there was anything romantic between them, Shayna Glassman said, \"I'm not sure what word to use to describe our relationship. There's no romance, but it's romantic because I was doing book reports about him since eighth grade. He was always part of my consciousness.\"",
      "She said she's been through some hard times and depression and has a feel for what Berkowitz may have gone through when he was only 24 years old.",
      "Berkowitz, she said, seems to be doing just fine after decades in captivity: \"He's still a human and he's happy. He has a great sense of humor. Yes, he killed people, that's not something to be taken lightly, but in the deepest depths there's always a light that can be presented.\"",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 A\u00a0wife of a Marine Corps veteran and mother of two was released from ICE custody on Monday after being detained in May during what she says she thought was a routine immigration office visit, she and her husband tell CBS News.",
      "\"I feel like a mom again, because well, I was, at some points, I was feeling guilty, like I failed my kids, because I was, you know, without them,\" Paola Clouatre, 25, said in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "Asked how she feels being reunited with her husband and children, she said, \"It feels good \u2014 good to be back with my family and my babies.\"",
      "She had just given birth to their second child and was still breastfeeding when she was detained on May 27.",
      "She was taken to an ICE detention facility in northern Louisiana, about four hours away from their Baton Rouge home. Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, would drive eight hours round-trip each week to visit with their infant daughter and 2-year-old son.",
      "\"It was very difficult,\" Paola said. \"They gave me a pump so I could pump milk and continue producing milk for when the baby came to be able to give it to her.\"",
      "Adrian Clouatre, 26, served in the Marine Corps for five years as an intelligence analyst. He said his wife was put in handcuffs in the lobby of an immigration enforcement field office in New Orleans after wrapping up a meeting with a staffer from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services about her green card application.",
      "\"I was furious,\" he said in an interview with CBS News in June about the arrest. \"I felt betrayed. They told us we passed the interview. ... They knew I was a veteran, they knew that my wife was breastfeeding our 9-week-old daughter, they knew we had two kids. ... I cried the whole way to my car after I left the building.\"",
      "Asked about the conditions she experienced during her time inside the detention facility, Paola said, \"It's difficult to be there, because they have a lot of rules. They are very strict. So it's very, very, hard to be there.\"",
      "But this week, Adrian said he finally got the call he'd been hoping for \u2014 his wife said she was going to be released, and he needed to make the drive one last time to pick her up.",
      "\"She called me from a CPO [officer's] phone, like one of the ICE agent's phones,\" he said.",
      "Paola said she didn't meet anyone else detained inside the facility who had a military family member or who was still breastfeeding.",
      "The couple met when he was still in the service in California, and they married in 2024.",
      "Adrian says his wife now wears a monitor on her ankle, as part of her condition of release on a recognizance bond, and has to check in every two weeks with an ICE parole officer. The couple had one such appointment Thursday morning.",
      "\"It was good to meet him today in the morning,\" Paola said about meeting with the parole officer assigned to her case. \"He is a nice person.\"",
      "Paola says she and her mother came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was a child, but her mother abandoned her when she was still a teenager, leaving Paola homeless. She said she hadn't spoken to her mother in years. It wasn't until this spring that she learned her mother had skipped a 2018 immigration hearing, and she says she had \"no idea\" the federal government had issued a deportation order against both of them as a result.",
      "\"There was no way for her to know about the removal order,\" Adrian said.",
      "Adrian said they thought they were going through the proper channels to obtain a green card for Paola after their marriage, and the process had previously gone smoothly.",
      "Instead, Paola became one of tens of thousands of people in custody and facing deportation as the\u00a0Trump administration pushes\u00a0for immigration officers to arrest 3,000 people a day. As of June 27,\u00a0arrests by ICE\u00a0during President Trump's second term had reached 109,000 \u2014 an increase of about 120% from the same time period in 2024 under President Biden \u2014 according to a CBS News analysis of government data. The majority of those arrests took place in border and Southern states, figures show.",
      "The couple's attorney, Carrey Holliday, a former immigration judge, said Paola's detention was unreasonable.",
      "\"There are lots of reasons why this shouldn't have happened. No. 1, Adrian, her husband, is a marine veteran, discharged honorably. She's the mother of two small children, and was nursing one,\" Holliday said. \"She really didn't know that she had an order of removal outstanding until about a week before she had an interview for a green card. They were trying to do things legally; they just didn't get the right advice.\"",
      "Holliday said Paola's case is an example of the new administration's \"hyper-enforcement environment.\"",
      "\"We're in a hyper-enforcement environment right now, and all the laws are being enforced without any real consideration for the individuals involved,\" Holliday said. \"DHS is taking some positions that... they've never taken before, especially on bond... DHS has now decided that everybody who comes across illegally can be considered an arriving alien. That has never been the definition, and it's quite a bad legal argument to make, but that's what they're making, nonetheless, and some immigration judges are buying it.\"",
      "Holliday said Paola no longer has a final order for removal, but she still has a long road of immigration court proceedings ahead to obtain a green card.\u00a0 Once some jurisdictional matters are resolved, they will seek to obtain a status called \"parole in place,\" which helps immediate family members of military service members have a more streamlined path to obtaining a green card.",
      "On June 9, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media about the case, writing that when Paola Clouatre \"was apprehended by @CBP and ordered removed by a judge in 2018, she chose to defy the order and stay in the U.S. 7 years later, she had another bad idea and applied for a Green Card. @ICEgov took her into custody at our New Orleans office. @DHSgov has a long memory and no tolerance for defiance when it comes to making America safe again.\"",
      "New federal priorities to detain immigrants with pending deportation orders are taking higher precedence than the deference previously afforded to military families, immigration law experts say. According to federal memos, the Trump administration has made any non-citizens with pending deportation orders a priority for arrests.",
      "CBS News reached out to ICE for a comment for this story, but has not yet received a response.",
      "During his wife's months in detention, Adrian sent letters to elected officials pleading for their help \u2014 even two letters to President Trump. He says it was office staff of Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy that stepped up and advocated for his wife's case. CBS News has reached out to Kennedy's office for comment, but has not received a response.",
      "\"I'm ecstatic, I'm extremely grateful to my lawyer, to John Kennedy's office, and the community for all the support,\" Adrian said.",
      "Paola echoed those feelings of appreciation.",
      "\"I feel happy, grateful,\" she said. \"Thankful for the senator (staff) spending time with my husband. Thank you to the community.\"",

      "After 700 meters, 18-year-old Summer McIntosh of Canada was slightly ahead but she faded and Ledecky won in 8:05.62, with Lani Pallister of Australia taking silver (8:05.98), with bronze for McIntosh (8:07.29).",

    "summary": "President Trump said he ordered his administration to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the July jobs report.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "An appeals court late Friday mostly kept in place restrictions on \"roving\" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing with a lower court judge who found that sweeps conducted by the Trump administration in Southern California appeared to have been predicated on people's race and other factors, like speaking Spanish.",
      "A panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit largely denied a Trump administration request to suspend the lower court ruling, which required federal immigration officials to have reasonable suspicion that someone is in the country illegally before detaining them.",
      "The immigration raids at the center of the legal battle triggered massive protests in the Los Angeles area in June, as well as widespread fears among the region's large Latino community. While most demonstrations were peaceful, instances of violence led President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles with orders to protect federal buildings and the immigration agents enforcing his far-reaching crackdown on illegal immigration. Most of them have since been demobilized.",
      "Those high-profile immigration arrests in California have continued, led by Customs and Border Protection agents who have been assigned to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers with furthering the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign \u2014 in some cases, far away from the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Beyond requiring CBP and ICE to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone, the July order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong prohibited federal agents from basing arrests on people's race or ethnicity, the fact that they speak Spanish or have an accent, their presence in a location, or their occupation.",
      "Frimpong stated that any immigration arrests that relied exclusively on these factors violated the U.S. Constitution's 4th Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.",
      "\"We agree with the district court that, in the context of the Central District of California, the four enumerated factors at issue \u2014 apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together \u2014 describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,'\" the 9th Circuit panel wrote in its opinion Friday.",
      "The panel was comprised of Circuit Judges Ronald M. Gould, Marsha S. Berzon, and Jennifer Sung, appointees of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden.",
      "The cases cited in the lawsuit against the Los Angeles-area immigration sweeps involved arrests in June near a car wash, a tow yard and other locations where U.S. citizens were among those questioned about their legal status and detained by federal agents. Advocates have described the operations as \"roving patrols.\"",
      "The 9th Circuit did alter one part of Frimpong's ruling, removing an exception to her ban on using the four factors that include people's race and vocation when making arrests. The panel said that an \"except as permitted by law\" clause in her order was too vague.",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates hailed Friday's ruling, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration sweeps as indiscriminate raids that have instilled fear in the Los Angeles area.",
      "\"Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to live, work, and belong in their community without being hunted, harassed, or locked away,\" said Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a Los Angeles-based group that represents those facing deportation.",
      "The Trump administration has maintained in court that federal officials rely on intelligence packages and certain information \u2014 like \"past experiences\" that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally frequent or work at certain locations \u2014 when carrying out immigration enforcement operations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Saturday, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that \"unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people.\"",
      "\"What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S.\u2014NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,\" she said. \"America's brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists\u2014truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities.  70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges. President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem are putting the American people first by removing illegal aliens who pose a threat to our communities. Law and order will prevail.\"",

    "summary": "\"Son of Sam\" victims look back at the serial murder spree that terrorized New York",
    "story": [
      "This story was originally posted on Aug. 10, 2017. It was updated on Aug. 2, 2025.",
      "On July 31, 1977, Robert Violante and Stacy Moskowitz were on their first date sitting in his parked car in a Brooklyn \"lovers lane\" when they were suddenly shot in their heads by the \"Son of Sam\" serial killer who terrorized New Yorkers for more than a year before his arrest on Aug. 10, 1977.",
      "\"The doctors said I was not going to make it, and that Stacy would,\" Violante told CBS News in 2017. A .44 caliber slug destroyed Violante's left eye and damaged his right eye as it tore across his skull. But it was Moskowitz, a 19-year-old college student, who succumbed to her wounds, and it was Violante, 20, who faced a life forever shattered by a maniac's bullets.",
      "Incredibly, just four days earlier, Violante landed a modeling job at the Wilhelmina Modeling Agency after taking an hour subway into \"the city\" \u2014 Manhattan. Once the agents saw the 6-feet-1 Violante, with his John Travolta looks, they immediately signed him up starting the following Monday. In many ways, he was a real-life Tony Manero, the character Travolta played in that year's iconic movie \"Saturday Night Fever.\"",
      "The next night, he met Moskowitz while out celebrating his good fortune at a \"Gong Show\" event at a popular \"Beefsteak Charlies.\" The eatery was \"wall to wall people,\" he recalled, and in the crush Violante found himself face-to-face with Stacy.",
      "\"She was a beautiful, beautiful girl,\" Violante said. \"And what a pleasant, pleasant girl. A very bubbly, full of life young lady.\" They hit it off, talked for hours, and agreed to see each other that Saturday night, July 31, even though they, like all New Yorkers, were worried about the \"Son of Sam.\"",
      "The serial killer had killed five and wounded six others, but he had never struck in Brooklyn. His female victims had shoulder-length dark hair. \"Stacy's a blonde,\" Violante reassured his mother as he headed out on their maiden date.",
      "They went to the movie, \"New York, New York,\" and then drove to Shore Parkway stopping near the water, where they strolled and played on a set of swings. \"We were like two little kids,\" Violante recalled.",
      "A figure lurking in the shadow, however, with his arms crossed, spooked Moskowitz. She asked to leave, and they got into Violante's car, but he said, \"Let's stay five minutes.\"",
      "He would forever wish he immediately drove away. Within two minutes, the car glass suddenly exploded. Everything went dark, and he thought he was dead.",
      "\"I was shot in the head, totally blind and full of blood,\" Violante recalled. \"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He killed us.\"",
      "Then he heard Moskowitz moaning and realized he was alive.",
      "Although gravely wounded and unable to see, Violante managed to open the car door, and wrap his hand around a nearby light pole. Screaming, \"We've been shot, we've been shot,\" he pressed his other hand on the car horn, honking it until the battery died, and he collapsed in the street.",
      "Days later, his father \u2014 \"my best pal\" \u2014broke the news Violante had lost his sight. Weeks later, he told Violante that Moskowitz   had died 18 hours after the shooting.",
      "\"I cried like a baby,\" Violante recalled.",
      "Violante never asked \"why me, because that would mean why not someone else.\" He became a portrait in courage, summoning an inner strength he never knew he had, and seemingly willing his damaged eye to improve enough to avoid the need of a Seeing Eye dog. \"I swore I would never have one,\" he said. Ultimately, after long stretches of rehabilitation, he obtained a rigorous mailer's position with the U.S. Postal Service, for which David Berkowitz, the \"Son of Sam,\" ironically also worked.",
      "Violante handled mail for 35 years until his\u00a0 retirement. He never married, and always wondered what might have evolved with Moskowitz   had their young relationship been given time to blossom.",
      "Nearly a year earlier and a borough away, Carl Denaro, then a 20-year-old who had just enlisted in the Air Force, had his life shattered by another .44 caliber slug in Flushing, Queens.",
      "Denaro, who was more hippie than Tony Manero, met Rosemary Keenan, 18, at a local bar on Oct. 23, 1976. They took a short drive to a nearby park, where gunfire suddenly shattered the windows of his Volkswagen Beetle. The bullets missed Keenan, and Denaro \"yelled at her to start the car, (and) let's get out of here,\" he told CBS News.",
      "They returned to the bar, where Denaro said, \"I don't feel too good.\" He rested his head on a table, and a large pool of blood spilled out from beneath his shoulder-length hair and shirt.",
      "At the time, no one had heard of the \"Son of Sam\" because he had yet to leave a note for police to figure out there was a pattern to the madness. In fact, police initially were suspicious of Denaro, and it took months before the NYPD realized they had a serial killer on the loose and Denaro was one of his victims.",
      "Doctors told Denaro that he was lucky. They put a plate in his head and he eventually returned to playing softball with friends. His military career derailed, and he went on to work for Merrill Lynch and in telecommunications financing before retiring. He recalled, however, that he lived for years with gawkers pointing out he was shot by the \"Son of Sam.\"",
      "Both Denaro and Violante rejoiced when David Berkowitz, a postal worker from Yonkers, was charged as the \"Son and Sam\" on Aug. 10, 1977.\u00a0 Neither is certain Berkowitz acted alone. And Violante admits he wanted Berkowitz to receive the death penalty. But they both are thrilled he is off the streets forever.",
      "\"Thank God,\" Violante recalled shouting when he heard the news decades ago in his hospital room. \"At least now he won't be able to harm anyone else.\"",

A second surgery found that a screw placed in her foot had been pressing on the head of one of her nerves. That screw was moved, and a nerve decompression was performed but the pain didn't stop.",
      "\"It would just turn black and blue, swell up really big, and I just was unable to put any weight on it,\" 41-year-old Meade said.",
      "The pain upended everything. She left her job as a surgical assistant since she could no longer stand for long periods. She was unable to take part in family activities with her two young sons. Even light breezes could trigger the pain. Resting under a blanket was unbearable, making sleep difficult. Meade compared the sensation to \"walking on a hot bed of Legos constantly, while getting stabbed with a pencil.\"",
      "Meade spent months seeing different specialists. Finally, after nearly a year, a doctor suggested Meade might have something called chronic regional pain syndrome. It was the first time Meade had heard of it. It would take even longer before she could find a treatment that helped her pain.",
      "What is chronic regional pain syndrome?",
      "Chronic regional pain syndrome, or CRPS, is a chronic disorder with no cure, said Dr. Rohan Jotwani, an interventional pain specialist and anesthesiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine. Jotwani was not involved in Meade's care. CRPS can occur after surgery, like Meade's, or from other injuries to the nerve.",
      "\"For some patients, they'll have an injury to a nerve and it will get better with time. For some patients, that injury will actually develop into its own chronic pain disorder,\" Jotwani said.",
      "Diagnosing the condition is difficult, Jotwani said. No test or scan can definitively identify it, and because it is a rare condition, many doctors may not be familiar with it, he added.",
      "Physicians have to rely on clinical criteria. Telltale hallmarks for the condition are extreme levels of pain at the source, even when nothing should be causing it - like when a bedsheet causes pain, as Meade experienced. CRPS patients may also experience swelling, changes in temperature and skin color or texture changes. They may even begin to lose function in the affected area.",
      "Diagnosing chronic regional pain syndrome is only the start, Jotwani said. Actually treating the condition requires a \"multi-pronged approach\" that can vary from person to person. Treatment typically starts with physical therapy. Patients may also take medication to decrease nerve signals in the area, so they feel less pain, or try interventional techniques like a nerve block. Meade tried multiple options, but nothing was improving her pain.",
      "\"Doing regular therapies was not working. I even heard, at 33, that I was getting older and that 'sometimes we just hurt more.' I thought that was comical,\" Meade said.",
      "Treating chronic regional pain syndrome",
      "In 2022, long after Meade's pain started, a doctor suggested she see physical therapist Dr. Anita Davis, who specializes in treating the condition and leads the comprehensive pain rehabilitation program at Brooks Rehabilitation in Florida. The pair worked to develop a physical therapy routine that would work for Meade.",
      "\"Before me, she had all of the traditional exercises ... and those things were just not possible with that much pain in her foot,\" Davis said. \"As healthcare providers, we ask patients to rate the pain from zero to 10. These folks are typically going to be at the top of the scale, even on a good day. When I ask her to do something that's painful on top of her existing pain, it's just crazy to think about doing that.\"",
      "They also worked on relaxation and emotional exercises to cope with the mental load of the constant pain.",
      "\"Pain management for Amber ... isn't just the physical aspects,\" Davis explained. \"Anything that enhances relaxing the nervous system is valuable.\"",
      "The protocol led to some improvements for Meade, but while CRPS patients can have \"symptoms subside for a length of time,\" it is \"a lifelong condition,\" Davis said.",
      "\"There's not a cure for it,\" Davis said.",
      "Working towards a less painful future",
      "Meade said she still feels pain and discomfort, and is at risk of flare-ups when the weather changes or if she steps the wrong way. In addition to working with Davis, she is taking medication and receiving ketamine infusions every few months. She said the combination of ketamine treatment and physical therapy allows her to \"do a lot more than I have been able to.\" The effects of the infusion usually last around four weeks. Meade uses that period to work on strengthening her body.",
      "\"I try to make some headway in my physical health before that starts going down, because I know it's going to,\" Meade said. \"The pain is a lot less when my physical health is better.\"",
      "Meade said even without the effects of the infusions, she is dealing with less pain than before her diagnosis and treatment. She can focus on her day-to-day activities. She sleeps better and can walk on the beach, one of her favorite activities. She can't do too much running around with her kids, but she can play catch and help with homework most days. Meade said she hopes to improve her functionality and eventually go back to work and be more active, but for now, she is grateful for what she has gained.",
      "\"I want to try to get to that point where I have less and less flares, and get up to doing what everybody enjoys doing: Working, coming home, having something to work towards, going on vacations,\" Meade said. \"Every time I have a good day, we work a little bit harder.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jeannie Seely, the soulful country music singer behind such standards like \"Don't Touch Me,\" has died. She was 85.",
      "Her publicist, Don Murry Grubbs, said she died Friday after succumbing to complications from an intestinal infection.",
      "Known as \"Miss Country Soul\" for her unique vocal style, Seely was a trailblazer for women in country music, celebrated for her spirited nonconformity and for a string of undeniable hits in the '60s and '70s.",
      "Her second husband, Gene Ward, died in December. In May, Seely revealed that she was in recovery after undergoing multiple back surgeries, two emergency procedures and spending 11 days in the ICU. She also suffered a bout of pneumonia.",
      "\"Rehab is pretty tough, but each day is looking brighter and last night, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And it was neon, so I knew it was mine!\" she said in a statement at the time. \"The unsinkable Seely is working her way back.\"",
      "Dolly Parton was one of several country music luminaries paying her tribute on Friday, saying she met Seely when they were both young and starting out in Nashville.",
      "\"She was one of my dearest friends,\" Parton said on her social media accounts. \"I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.\"",
      "Singer Charlie Daniels said on X that Seely was \"a national treasure, and one fine lady.\"",
      "Seely was born in July 1940, in Titusville, Pennsylvania, about two hours north of Pittsburgh and was raised in nearby Townville. Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 20:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trade experts say the Trump administration's barrage of new tariffs could raise prices for consumers and cause headaches for businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order hiking tariffs on U.S. imports could drive up consumer prices and prolong uncertainty for millions of businesses, trade experts said.",
      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

While the storm that day had previously been analyzed by scientists, new satellite technology recently documented the megaflash exceeding 500 miles.",

The current WMO-recognized record for longest duration megaflash occurred over Argentina and Uruguay in June 2020 and was about 17 seconds.",

      "Park has been a Christian chaplain at Tampa General Hospital in Florida for more than a decade, working alongside 24 other chaplains of various faiths. He has seen firsthand how in times of crisis, faith often becomes a lifeline for those suffering.",
      "\"I believe it is a spiritual experience,\" Park said when asked if death is spiritual. \"So much of death involves making meaning of what is happening, questioning our own value of the life that was lived. These are all spiritual and existential things.\"",
      "How some incorporate spirituality into their lives",
      "Around 70% of U.S. adults consider themselves spiritual, meaning they believe in something bigger than themselves, like God or a creator.",

      "\"So there are some who pursue spirituality in a way that I need something in this moment that's bigger than the treatment, the medication, the care team, and there are some who are just angry at God,\" Park said. \"I validate both. Because both of these for me are spiritual experiences.\"",

      "Now, having held thousands of hands on death beds, Park has learned that even with faith, not everything makes sense.",
      "\"We do live on a world of extreme unthinkable, unfair suffering. And on the other hand, we live in a world of the possibility of love covering pain,\" Park said. \"I as a chaplain sit at the intersection of my patients and their extreme suffering and my love for them, my care for them, our care for them, in some way representing or reflecting the love of God.\"",
      "For Park, the hospital has become a sacred space.",

      "U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday met with the families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza\u00a0in Tel Aviv as fears for the captives' survival grew nearly 22 months into the war.",
      "The families of the hostages were protesting in Tel Aviv, urging Israel's government to push harder for the release of their loved ones. Witkoff, who was greeted with some applause and pleas for assistance, joined them for a closed meeting.",
      "Videos shared online showed Witkoff arriving as families chanted \"Bring them home!\" and \"We need your help.\"",
      "The Hostages of Missing Families Forum confirmed the meeting, which came a week after Witkoff quit ceasefire talks, blaming Hamas' intransigence and pledging to find other ways to free the hostages and make Gaza safe.",
      "After the meeting, the Forum released a statement saying that Witkoff had given them a personal commitment that he and President Trump would work to return the remaining hostages.",
      "\"We will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part. We will do what's right for the Gazan people,\" Witkoff said in the meeting, according to the Forum.",
      "Michal Iluz, father of slain hostage Guy Iluz, said Witkoff spoke about the deal \"that is going to be all or nothing.\"",
      "\"We told him that nothing is not ok for us,\" Iluz said.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were abducted by Hamas-led terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, around 20 are believed to be alive in Gaza. Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in Gaza, released separate videos of individual hostages this week, triggering outrage among hostage families and Israeli society.",
      "Israeli media haven't broadcast the videos, calling them propaganda, but the family of 21-year-old Rom Braslavski allowed the release of a photograph showing him visibly emaciated in an unknown location. After viewing the video, Tami Braslavski, his mother, blamed top Israeli officials and demanded they meet with her.",
      "\"They broke my child, I want him home now,\" Braslavski told Ynet on Thursday. \"Look at him: Thin, limp, crying. All his bones are out.\"",

      "\"Do the right thing and just do it now,\" said Lior Chorev, chief strategy officer of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "Witkoff's meeting with the families came a day after he and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee toured one of the privately run U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's distribution sites in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.",
      "\"We received briefings from (the IDF) and spoke to folks on the ground. GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!\" Huckabee said in a social media post.",

      "\"It's the same daily episode,\" Youssef said.",
      "In response to questions about several eyewitness accounts of violence at the northernmost of the Israeli-backed American contractor's four facilities, GHF said \"nothing (happened) at or near our sites.\"",
      "\"We weren't close to them (the troops) and there was no threat,\" Abed Salah, a man in his 30s who was among the crowds close to the GHF site near Netzarim corridor, said. \"I escaped death miraculously.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of young Catholics poured into a vast field on Rome's outskirts Saturday for the weekend highlight of the Vatican's 2025 Holy Year: an evening vigil, outdoor slumber party and morning Mass celebrated by Pope Leo XIV that marks his first big encounter with the next generation of Catholics.",
      "Leo arrived by helicopter as the sun set over the Tor Vergata field and immediately boarded his open-topped popemobile for long loops through the flag-waving, cheering pilgrims. They had already been partying there for hours, setting up campsites for the night as misting trucks and water cannons spritzed them to cool them down from the 85F temperatures.",
      "\"It is something spiritual, that you can experience only every 25 years,\" said Francisco Michel, a pilgrim from Mexico. \"As a young person, having the chance to live this meeting with the pope, I feel it is a spiritual growth.\"",
      "For the past week, these bands of young Catholics from around the world have poured into Rome for their special Jubilee celebration, in a Holy Year in which 32 million people are expected to descend on the Vatican to participate in a centuries-old pilgrimage to the seat of Catholicism.",
      "The young people have been traipsing down cobblestoned streets in color-coordinated T-shirts, praying the Rosary and singing hymns with guitars, bongo drums and tambourines shimmying alongside. Using their flags as tarps to shield them from the sun, they have taken over entire piazzas for Christian rock concerts and inspirational talks, and stood for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to 1,000 priests offering the sacrament in a dozen different languages.",
      "History's\u00a0first American pope\u00a0was presiding over the vigil Saturday night. He was then returning to the Vatican for the night and coming back for another popemobile romp and Mass on Sunday morning.",
      "A mini World Youth Day, 25 years later",
      "It all has the vibe of a World Youth Day, the Catholic Woodstock festival that St. John Paul II inaugurated and made famous in Rome in 2000 at the very same Tor Vergata field. Then, before an estimated 2 million people, John Paul told the young pilgrims they were the \"sentinels of the morning\" at the dawn of the third millennium.",
      "Officials had initially expected 500,000 youngsters this weekend, but Leo hinted the number might reach 1 million.",
      "\"It's a bit messed up, but this is what is nice about the Jubilee,\" said Chloe Jobbour, a 19-year-old Lebanese Catholic who was in Rome with a group of more than 200 young members of the Community of the Beatitudes, a France-based charismatic group.",
      "She said, for example, that it had taken two hours to get dinner at a KFC overwhelmed by orders on Friday night. The Salesian school that offered her group housing is an hour away by bus. But Jobbour, like many in Rome this week, didn't mind the discomfort: It's all part of the experience.",
      "\"I don't expect it to be better than that. I expected it this way,\" she said, as members of her group gathered on church steps near the Vatican to sing and pray Saturday morning before heading out to Tor Vergata.",
      "There was one tragedy before the vigil began. The Vatican confirmed that an Egyptian 18-year-old woman, identified as Pascale Rafic, died during the pilgrimage, reportedly of cardiac arrest. Leo met on Saturday with her group and extended his condolences to her family.",
      "Romans inconvenienced, but tolerant",
      "Those Romans who didn't flee the onslaught have been inconvenienced by the additional strain on the city's notoriously insufficient public transport system. Residents are sharing social media posts of outbursts by Romans at kids flooding subway platforms and crowding bus stops, which have delayed and complicated their commutes to work.",
      "But other Romans have welcomed the enthusiasm the youngsters have brought. Premier Giorgia Meloni offered a video welcome, marveling at the \"extraordinary festival of faith, joy and hope\" that the young people had created.",
      "\"I think it's marvelous,\" said Rome hairdresser Rina Verdone, who lives near the Tor Vergata field and woke up Saturday to find a gaggle of police outside her home as part of the massive, 4,000-strong operation mounted to keep the peace. \"You think the faith, the religion, is in difficulty, but this is proof that it's not so.\"",
      "Verdone had already made plans to take an alternate route home Saturday afternoon, which would require an extra half-mile walk, because she feared the \"invasion\" of kids in her neighborhood would disrupt her usual bus route. But she said she was more than happy to make the sacrifice.",
      "\"You think of invasion as something negative. But this is a positive invasion,\" she said.",

      "Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe\u00a0was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman's legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\"Politics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\" Uribe said after Friday's hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense's request because it would be \"easy\" for the former president to leave the country to \"evade the imposed sanction.\"",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday's sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \"think much more about the solution than the problem\" during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia's Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe's alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe's party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \"It's an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \"is enough\" and, even if the former president appeals, \"history has already condemned him.\"",
      "During Uribe's presidency, Colombia's military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America's oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group's leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 09:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "South Africa, which has a strained relationship with President Trump, is the only African country singled out in the announcement with a 30% tariff increase on August 7.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg, South Africa \u2014 African countries had been bracing for bad news and scrambling for last-minute negotiations ahead of President Trump's announcement of tariffs on Thursday night.",
      "South Africa, which has had a\u00a0strained relationship with Mr. Trump, is the only African country singled out in the announcement with a 30% tariff increase on Aug. 7. Most other African countries have been hit with tariffs of 10-15%.",
      "South African Trade Minister Parks Tau said he, other ministers, and people across all sectors, from business to civil society, had been working for months to negotiate a deal with Washington, including offering to invest $3.3 billion in U.S. industries and buy natural gas but there was no response.",
      "\"My opinion, we have pulled out all stops, sending ministers from various departments, business delegations and trade unions to fully address U.S. concerns,\" Tau said.",
      "He said there was no response to their initial offer until Wednesday evening, when U.S. officials told them to improve their offer in a last-minute appeal.",
      "\"We don't have a deal, we spoke to U.S. last night (Wednesday) and they indicated that they could not confirm what the announcement would be and encouraged us to submit an enhanced proposal that would be presented to the White House,\" Tau said.",
      "In a statement Thursday night, Tau said, \"We are working with urgency and resolve to implement real, practical interventions that defend jobs and position South Africa competitively in a shifting global landscape.\"",
      "In neighboring Lesotho, the government declared a state of emergency following the declaration in April that the U.S. would impose a 50% tariff \u2014 the highest in the world. The threat of tariffs had devastating effects reverberating across the tiny mountain kingdom of just over 2 million people. The notice came just months after U.S. aid funding cuts and now the threat of tariffs meant many garment companies closed their doors or reduced their staff to half-time in the ensuing months.",
      "Lesotho is often referred to as the \"denim capital of Africa\" as it is where Levi's and other brands are manufactured, as well as other textiles for companies like JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), created in 2000 as part of the \"trade not aid\" philosophy, gives some 35 African countries duty-free access to the U.S. for their goods. The textile industry, the country's main employer, providing as many as 50000 jobs, has had a trade surplus with the U.S. for the last few years. This is why some economists believe Mr. Trump singled out Lesotho for the hefty tariffs.",
      "Addressing Congress in March, Mr. Trump was listing off global cuts that he called wasteful expenditure and cited Lesotho as an African nation \"no one has ever heard of.\" His words reverberated across the country and started months of diplomacy that culminated in various concessions, including a willingness to accept deportees from the U.S., as well as other financial incentives likely helped revise the massive tariffs threatened downwards.",
      "Most African countries will have a 10-15% tariff imposed but remain concerned as the September deadline to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act approaches. Some analysts believe Mr. Trump will cancel it. Losing the free entry to the U.S. will mean all goods now exported under AGOA duty-free will be subjected to tariffs and will significantly impact these countries' economic growth. The new tariffs, combined with the loss of AGOA, could see increasing inflation and the depreciation of currencies in these countries, economists warn. It's a hit that many countries will struggle to absorb.",
      "Analysts are now looking toward the G20 in November in South Africa as a possibility to create new regional and global trade deals that do not include the U.S.",
      "\"I think we toss the U.S. out of the G20 for so many reasons and get tougher on Donald Trump to know collective will, that is the only response now,\" Patrick Bond, the distinguished professor and director of social change at the University of Johannesburg, told CBS News.",
      "Earlier this week, on board Air Force One, Mr. Trump told reporters that he might skip the G20 altogether, saying, \"I might send someone else because I have had a lot of problems with South Africa, they have very bad policies.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has falsely claimed the country has race-based laws, with the government seizing white farmers' land. As a result, Mr. Trump has offered refugee status to Afrikaans farmers, which several hundred have already accepted and are now living in the U.S. The U.S. government is also unhappy with South Africa's case of genocide at the International Criminal Court.",
      "With Thursday night's announcement of a 30% tariff for South Africa, it's clear the political tension between the countries now has economic consequences.",
      "South Africa's Reserve Bank Governor, Lesetja Kganyago, had warned in mid-July that a 30% tariff would mean a loss of 100,000 jobs. Economists warn that the country's agriculture and automotive industries will be the hardest hit.",
      "Bond warned South Africa could face a dire economic crisis if it doesn't shift quickly to diversify its export markets.",
      "\"We must diversify export markets and look at our own infrastructure projects and have massive subsidies for that,\" he said. \"None of the approaches in our toolbox are working, so we must move to new options and protect our industries.\"",
      "The South African government is concerned that the new tariffs will spark a lack of confidence in the market, bringing massive job losses and capital flight.",
      "President Cyril Ramaphosa speaking Friday to media at the swearing in of a new police minister avoided being pinned down on a response to the tariffs saying only: \"We deal with every government with the required respect and dignity and that is how we conduct our foreign policy and diplomatic matters and we expect that respect to be reciprocated\" before conceding that \"its too risky to be dependent on one country for trade.\"",

Yoon, a conservative, faces investigations into other criminal allegations that are not related to his Dec. 3 martial law decree but target him, his wife and others.",
      "On Friday, Min Joong-ki, a special counsel named by his liberal rival and new President Lee Jae Myung, sent investigators to retrieve Yoon from a detention center near Seoul after the former president twice defied requests to attend questioning. Min's team is tasked with delving into allegations surrounding Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, including that she and her husband exerted inappropriate influence on the then-ruling party's election nomination process in 2022.",

      "Oh said her team members refrained from using physical means out of safety concerns, but notified Yoon that they would execute the warrant next time. She urged Yoon to cooperate, as the Korean people are closely watching whether the enforcement of the law is applied to everyone equally.",
      "Yu Jeong-hwa, a lawyer for Yoon, accused the special counsel team of trampling on Yoon's dignity and honor by discussing his dress in prison, according to local media reports.",
      "Yoon's defense team earlier said Yoon was unable to attend his trial and undergo questioning by investigators because of heath problems. They said in a statement Thursday that Yoon has cardiovascular, autonomic nervous system and eye issues. They cited an unidentified hospital as saying that Yoon faces the risk of blindness because he failed to receive medical treatment for the past three months.",
      "Yoon's Dec. 3\u00a0imposition of martial law, which brought armed troops into Seoul streets, lasted only several hours before lawmakers voted down his decree unanimously. It plunged the country into political turmoil.",
      "Yoon said he imposed martial law out of frustration with the opposition and vowed to eliminate \"anti-state\" forces. During a televised speech at the time, he said martial law would help \"rebuild and protect\" the country from \"falling into the depths of national ruin.",

      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "Over the years, the U.S. has implemented heavy sanctions on Iranian industries, including trying to stop tankers used to transfer Iranian oil to China, which could help fund Iranian nuclear development programs. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department imposed additional sanctions, which Washington called the most extensive action of its kind since 2018.",
      "Recently, a CBS News crew set off from Singapore, one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, to head more than 80 nautical miles away in international waters to see how the \"dark fleet\" operates.",

      "The supply is Iran, the demand is China, and this mutually beneficial relationship, which has long angered the United States, plays out off the coast of Malaysia in the Riau archipelago, an area the size of New York City.",
      "\"This is 'dark fleet' parking central,\" said Brown, who's been monitoring the \"dark fleet\" for years.",
      "He described one ship, the Tifani, as \"a well-known 'dark fleet' tanker that's always been out here on a regular basis.\"",
      "The tankers, full of oil, sail from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Malacca to the Riau archipelago. There, they transfer the crude to ships bound for China, which buys 90% of Iran's oil.",

      "Close by, another ship-to-ship transfer was underway involving the Alps \u2014   not its real name \u2014   filled with Iranian crude that was also sanctioned in May. The receiving vessel Eon, which is not on any list, was caught in the act \u2014   a new sanctions violator.",
      "According to a congressional report last year, this trade generated as much as $70 billion for Iran, propping up the regime and its nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on this trade this year, but it's having little effect. China doesn't recognize the unilateral U.S. sanctions on Iran and says that its trade with Iran is legitimate.",

Witkoff landed in Israel on Thursday, and the White House said he and U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee will visit Gaza\u00a0on Friday to inspect aid operations.",
      "Witkoff is expected to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and a possible ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters told The Associated Press.",

This includes 54 people killed while awaiting food in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing on Wednesday, the ministry said.",
      "That figure is expected to rise further, as many of those killed or wounded were brought to isolated, smaller hospitals in northern Gaza and have not yet been counted.",

      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas.

      "\"Dopamine anchoring\" is the latest psychology hack making the rounds on social media.",

      "\"Vape stores are popping up in every neighborhood in America, and many are selling addictive products like concentrated 7-OH. After the last wave of the opioid epidemic, we cannot get caught flat-footed again,\" Makary said in an FDA statement. \"7-OH is an opioid that can be more potent than morphine. We need regulation and public education to prevent another wave of the opioid epidemic.\"",
      "During a news conference on Tuesday, Makary suggested that the public health community is often late to act against dangerous substances due to a \"disconnect between the ivory towers and the streets.\" He then pondered aloud if experts had been to vape stores, as it \"affects what we see in the operating room.\"",
      "According to the FDA, 7-OH is beginning to be recognized for its potential to be abused because of its ability to bind to opioid receptors. Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products \"may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.\"",
      "\"I am in favor of this move because of the relationship of the 7-OH to the opioid receptors. This is essentially an opioid. It is semisynthetic and derived from the kratom plant whose leaves make a stimulant. There are no approved 7-OH drugs or diet supplements,\" FOX News Senior Medical Analyst Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital. \"Bravo to the FDA for this move \u2014 it should be listed as a controlled substance.\"",

      "\"I felt that I could do anything with my willpower, but this compulsion was absolutely impervious to my will, and part of the problem was just the availability. It was too easy to get this drug for me,\" Kennedy said.",

      "Between 60% and 80% of patients will develop a rash, according to experts.",
      "Lyme disease is prevalent this time of year, especially in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and upper-Midwest regions of the U.S.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"We're looking for specific findings, like the classic bull's-eye rash, a swollen joint or a facial droop called Bell's palsy, which can be seen with Lyme disease,\" Dr.\u00a0Andrew Handel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Stony Brook Children's Hospital on Long Island, New York, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",

      "AS LYME DISEASE TESTS MISS MANY ACUTE INFECTIONS, POTENTIAL AT-HOME TEST OFFERS HOPE FOR EARLIER DIAGNOSIS",
      "If the infection isn\u2019t treated at the time of the rash, patients will typically seek medical attention for later manifestations of the infection, Handel noted.",
      "Those can include Bell\u2019s palsy (facial nerve paralysis), Lyme meningitis (often marked by severe headache, neck stiffness and fever) and carditis (inflammation of heart tissues).",
      "The infection can lead to severe muscle and joint pain, Lyme arthritis, cardiac complications and neurological conditions, experts told Fox News Digital.\u00a0\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "One of the earliest signs of Lyme disease is overwhelming fatigue and joint aches, according to Dr. Daniel Cameron, an epidemiologist in Mount Kisco, New York, who specializes in tick-borne illnesses.",
      "Other symptoms may include fever, brain fog, dizziness, palpitations and nerve pain, among others.",
      "Testing, treatment and prevention",
      "A blood test can help diagnose Lyme disease, but timing matters.",
      "\"The way we diagnose Lyme disease in the blood is by looking for antibodies, for the immune system's response to the infection, as opposed to other infectious testing, where you find the bacteria itself,\" Handel told Fox News Digital.",
      "TICK BITES AND LYME DISEASE: WHAT TO DO IF A TICK BITES YOU OR YOUR PET",
      "Testing too early can result in a false negative, as antibody tests often don't turn positive until three or four weeks after the tick bite occurred.",
      "After sustaining a tick bite, experts recommend immediately removing the tick and seeing a healthcare provider.",
      "Doctors will typically prescribe a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a 200-milligram dose of the antibiotic doxycycline to be taken within 72\u2005hours of a high-risk tick bite, epidemiologists told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It's the immune system\u2019s lingering response to the infection that you had in the past.\"",
      "Although studies have found this dose to be effective in the majority of cases, some physicians prefer a longer course of treatment for tick bites.",
      "\"I'm not a big fan of a single dose of doxycycline [200 mg] for a tick bite, even though it's pretty popular,\" Cameron told Fox News Digital. \"I don\u2019t feel comfortable with a single dose if I really\u00a0want to avoid Lyme.\"",

      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",

      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",

Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about.

      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone.

      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement.

It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you.

      "At the heart of these changes is the ability to favorite drivers, a new option that helps you reconnect with drivers who deliver top-tier service. Once a ride is over, you can mark that driver as a favorite. Lyft will then try to match you with them again for future scheduled rides.

      "The goal behind these updates is to create stronger connections between drivers and passengers. According to Lyft, this new system also opens up better earning opportunities for drivers. If a driver gets favorited, they'll receive priority access to that rider's scheduled trips, a win-win for both sides.

The new Lyft Safety Hub will serve as a central location for all safety settings.

      "These updates from Lyft reflect a broader shift occurring across the rideshare industry: a shift toward more personalized, rider-centric experiences. Companies like Lyft and Uber are recognizing that convenience alone isn't enough; riders also want consistency, control and safety built into every trip. By allowing you to favorite trusted drivers and block those you'd prefer to avoid, Lyft is giving you more say in who you share a car with. These tools create a more predictable, comfortable experience, especially for regular commuters or those who rely on ridesharing for daily routines.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

This evolution marks a significant departure from the one-size-fits-all model that once defined the rideshare experience.",
      "As the industry becomes increasingly competitive, companies are focusing on trust, personalization and fostering long-term relationships between riders and drivers.

      "Viral robot freakout sparks safety concerns",
      "In the viral clip, the full-sized humanoid robot named DeREX is suspended from a crane inside a factory in China.

      "The image shows a component related to lithium-ion battery recycling technology\u00a0 (WPI)",
      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "Why this matters for clean energy and supply chains",
      "Battery waste is piling up, and mining for fresh materials isn't sustainable. Wang's team has proven that high-performance batteries can be made from recycled components at scale.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "This reduces our dependence on destructive mining operations, lowers emissions, and makes battery manufacturing more resilient to global supply shocks. Even better? These recycled batteries perform just as well as new ones. Unlike traditional methods that recover raw metals but degrade performance, this upcycling process regenerates high-value cathodes with next-gen chemistry, turning old batteries into components even better aligned with today's EV and storage systems.",
      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "If you think electric trucking means buying a brand-new semi, think again. Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn't replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
      "In 2025, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And for the first time, heavy-duty trucks edged out passenger vehicles in how much pollution they produce. That makes freight the low-hanging fruit in the fight to reduce emissions. But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",

      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "AI-powered scam alerts for Friends and Family payments. (PayPal)",
      "How do AI-powered scam alerts work?",
      "The alerts use machine learning models that constantly update and improve. These AI tools analyze billions of data points to detect new scam patterns, even ones they haven't seen before. If a payment seems suspicious, the system will interrupt the transaction with a tailored alert. And the higher the risk, the stronger the warning.",
      "Unlike traditional alerts, these messages escalate in urgency depending on the likelihood of fraud. In high-risk cases, PayPal may even block the payment automatically.",
      "Why PayPal and Venmo built this AI feature",
      "Scammers constantly shift tactics, especially on social media. Fraudsters will often pressure people to send Friends and Family payments, which aren't eligible for refunds. That's why PayPal designed this system to act before the money leaves your account. According to the company, putting real-time warnings in front of users empowers them to make informed decisions when it matters most.",

      "PayPal's alert system is powerful, but your behavior matters too. Here are some simple ways to keep your data safe:",
      "Use a different password for every account. Avoid personal details and common phrases. Combine three or more random words for strength. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords.",
      "Limit public access to your phone number and email. Avoid posting travel pics in real time. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA)\u00a0wherever possible.",
      "Check your credit reports regularly. Set up alerts for changes or unusual activity. Act fast if anything looks suspicious.",
      "Install security updates as soon as they're available. Only use trusted app stores and verified downloads. Don't forget to secure your kids' devices too.",
      "Avoid accessing financial accounts on public networks: Never share sensitive info over\u00a0unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a VPN or mobile data connection when possible.",

      "Don't click links or download attachments from unknown senders. Avoid urgent messages pressuring immediate action. If in doubt, don't reply. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Online scams aren't going away, but tools like AI-powered alerts from PayPal and Venmo are making it much harder for scammers to win. These intelligent alerts combine speed, adaptability, and user-focused design to warn you before money leaves your account. Pair that with smart personal habits, and you're on the path to safer online spending.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",

      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

But he knew it was dangerous. So, he had his men tie him to the mast and block their ears with beeswax. Then, they sailed toward the Island of the Sirens. Why? Because Odysseus understood that once he heard their song, he wouldn't be able to resist. And that song always leads to trouble.",

      "A dad working on his laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "At the end of the day, protecting your parents isn't just about warnings or knowledge. It's about cutting off scammers before they even get a chance to call or reach out in some way. Removing personal data from sketchy sites is the secret weapon here. It's simple, effective, and frees your loved ones from emotional traps.",

    "story": [
      "Before New York City mayoral primary winner Zohran Mamdani made a splash, another big-city Democratic mayoral candidate with progressive bona fides unexpectedly burst onto the national political scene.",
      "Two years later, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s tenure has captured so much negative attention (dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Worst Mayor\u201d by The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board) that Mamdani\u2019s campaign has taken note. Mamdani\u2019s camp is tracking Johnson\u2019s challenges and trying to avoid repeating Second City missteps, according to a person close to both Mamdani\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s teams.",
      "Johnson isn\u2019t the only progressive major-city mayor in the country, and his troubles wouldn\u2019t automatically translate to ideological allies. Mamdani himself has \u201crepeatedly cited\u201d another progressive mayor as a role model, as The Boston Globe noted: Boston Mayor Michelle Wu.",
      "But Johnson\u2019s tenure in Chicago does serve as a useful early warning system for some of the issues Mamdani could confront in New York, whether in a multiway general election or as mayor, if he wins in November. Chicago Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor, a strong campaign ally who has also criticized some of the mayor\u2019s early decisions, noted how critics often trot out the word \u201csocialism\u201d to cast blame on Johnson for long-standing issues facing the city. It\u2019s a phenomenon, she added, that Mamdani could similarly face.",
      "\u201cPeople make this a bad word. People make this into something that it is not. Let\u2019s just call all of this what it is: This is the way the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, because they get us fighting on s--- that just does not even matter,\u201d she said.",
      "Johnson was a county commissioner, schoolteacher and union organizer when he leapfrogged far more battle-tested candidates to clinch the city\u2019s mayoralty. While Mamdani knocked out former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in New York City, before Cuomo began a third-party run, Johnson eliminated incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot from contention with his rise.",
      "Johnson, who does not call himself a democratic socialist but believes in many of the same principles as Mamdani, was swept into office by a coalition underpinned by the powerful Chicago Teachers Union and the city\u2019s Black and brown voters. He vowed to unite fractured coalitions and lift up the most vulnerable. He represented change, and his strong roots in the community as an activist, a parent and a resident of a neighborhood that struggles with crime gave hope around new efforts toward equality across a city long deeply segregated by race and income.",
      "The young, energetic activist with a passion for fighting wealth inequality and lifting up the city\u2019s left-behind neighborhoods entered office with much promise. But it hasn\u2019t gone well since then.",
      "\u201cThey lost the plot,\u201d the person close to both Mamdani\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s teams said of Johnson\u2019s tenure. The person noted that while both Johnson and Mamdani have specific visions, they said Mamdani is \u201cpragmatic and he wants to succeed\u201d but described Johnson as unbending at times.",
      "One of the most significant missteps, the person said, was whom Johnson brought into his administration, adding: \u201cStaffing is very important. You need professionals who can execute your vision. Those may not be the same people who ran your campaign.\u201d",
      "One of Mamdani\u2019s recent communications hires comes with deep experience. Dora Pekec, who once served as a campaign manager for Chicago Alderman Bill Conway, also worked with House Majority PAC before heading communications for Brad Lander in his New York mayoral run. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio also recently suggested staffers under his administration would be ripe for picking.",
      "It was a point that Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, D-Ill., also underscored. Garcia was among those who lost in the first round of Chicago\u2019s 2023 mayoral election.",
      "\u201cWhen progressives run for high office it\u2019s critical to be ready to govern,\u201d Garcia wrote in a text message. \u201cGoverning entails striking a balance between promises made (ideals) and making the wheels of government turn. Need to assemble a team that understands your priorities and deliver services, keep relationships with stakeholders especially a base while expanding through engagement. Intergovernmental relationships need to be really keen.\u201d",
      "\u201cExperience in developing and executing plans is most important. This applies to Johnson and when Mamdani is elected,\u201d he continued.",
      "Agendas and obstacles",
      "While attempting to make headway on his agenda, Johnson was confronted with a rash of challenges facing Chicago, and his popularity began to slide. With some exceptions, observers say it was less about Johnson pushing far-left policies and more about the mayor\u2019s confrontational style, his struggles to communicate and his inability to forge alliances with state and federal officials.",
      "Even as he made headway in the areas of public safety and mental health, Johnson grew entrenched in battles big and small, cultivating an air of drama over his City Hall.",
      "While Johnson eschewed criticism during his campaign that he would be owned by the teachers union, those concerns persisted. He did hammer out a teachers contract without a disruption to the school year \u2014 no small feat \u2014 but it proved to be a bad-tempered and messy ordeal that could bring lasting political reprisal. He went to war with and fired a popular schools CEO, and also saw the resignations of the entire board of education, which Johnson had appointed.",
      "Johnson almost immediately saw his coalition splinter over an influx of migrants whom Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused into Chicago without warning. Like other major cities at the time, Chicago grappled with how to adequately house families vying for legal status. The city clashed with its own residents, including in neighborhoods of color, with much of the political backlash affecting Johnson.",
      "He and Gov. JB Pritzker, a fellow Democrat, share a frosty relationship at best. He locked horns with his city council over major policy decisions. He broke a campaign promise by seeking a $300 million property tax increase then suffered the humiliation of a 50-0 council defeat.",
      "William Daley, the son of longtime Mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of longtime Mayor Richard M. Daley, said Johnson\u2019s troubles at least partially stem from lacking experience in managing an expansive budget and overseeing tens of thousands of employees. He predicted that, if elected, the 33-year-old Mamdani could face similar political troubles as Johnson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tough job if you\u2019ve never been in politics or in a job that manages something big,\u201d Daley said, noting his brother\u2019s prior experience before his mayorship. \u201cRich had eight years as state\u2019s attorney. \u2026 He had that experience for eight years \u2014 running something. It\u2019s not an easy task for these people who have never run anything.\u201d",
      "Johnson\u2019s predecessors had their own shortcomings, from public corruption to massive civil rights failures, relentless crime and poor fiscal management that still haunts the city today. In 2008, then-Mayor Richard M. Daley sold the city\u2019s parking meters to private investors for a staggering 75 years, trading billions of dollars in future revenue to plug a budget hole for a one-time payment.",
      "Taylor, the Chicago City Council member, said that while Johnson \u201cmade some rookie mistakes\u201d he is unfairly getting the brunt of the blame for mistakes shared by predecessors.",
      "\u201cYou think in 22 months we have dug a $1.5 billion hole?\u201d she said of those blaming Johnson. \u201cThe math ain\u2019t mathing.\u201d",
      "New beginnings",
      "Politically, things have potential to look up for Johnson. Trump has sicced his Department of Justice on the mayor to investigate his hiring practices after Johnson had discussed hiring Black individuals for key positions. Johnson fired back that his hiring reflected the country and the city, while Trump\u2019s hiring reflected a \u201ccountry club.\u201d",
      "It caught on in conservative circles, with cable news hosts bashing Johnson just as they had done with Lightfoot. In an interview, she said Mamdani could expect the same.",
      "Lightfoot often hit back, and that brought its own repercussions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fight against the guy who\u2019s got the biggest megaphone in the world,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cMany of us who were Black women, like me in Chicago, like Muriel Bowser in D.C., like Keisha Lance Bottoms in Atlanta, when he mentioned us by name in a disparaging way, candidly, the death threats went through the roof.\u201d",
      "Moving into the second half of his term, Johnson can point to public safety as one of his biggest achievements. Observers largely applaud his choice of Superintendent Larry Snelling to lead the police department, as well as policies the mayor has put into place, like boosting mental health services, restructuring the detectives bureau and backing violence intervention methods.",
      "The number of murders in the city has fallen for two consecutive years, and Chicago could be on pace to reach the mayor\u2019s goal of having fewer than 500 homicides this year for the first time in a decade.",
      "\u201cMayor Johnson\u2019s primary focus over his first two years in office has been on driving down violent crime in Chicago. Since taking office, Chicago has seen historic reductions in crime and violence under the Johnson administration\u2019s holistic approach,\u201d a spokesperson from Johnson\u2019s office said in a statement, citing a 33% drop in homicides in the first six months of 2025 and a 38% drop in shootings in that same period. It also boasted of having the highest homicide clearance rate in more than a decade.",
      "As far as Johnson\u2019s poll numbers, \u201cthe narrative that Mayor Johnson is unpopular has been constructed by a small number of well-funded political organizations opposed to the Mayor\u2019s progressive agenda,\u201d the statement said."

    "published": "Sat, 02 Aug 2025 16:13:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Brazilian products are subject to a 50% tariff not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of Trump\u2019s relationship with Brazil's former president.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Products imported to the U.S. from Brazil \u2014 including almost a third of the supply relied on every day by America\u2019s coffee drinkers \u2014 are subject to a 50% tariff beginning Friday, not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with the country\u2019s former strongman president Jair Bolsonaro, and because of the actions of one of the justices of Brazil\u2019s supreme court.",
      "Trump typically justifies his tariffs by pointing to the U.S. trade deficit and saying that other nations are taking advantage of the United States. Many economists disagree with his view, but it doesn\u2019t matter in this instance: The U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Brazil of hundreds of billions of dollars over more than a decade, not a deficit.",
      "Still, on Friday, Trump imposed a total 50% tariff on certain products imported from Brazil, the highest rate of any country in the world.",
      "Earlier this week, the Trump administration also slapped the supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, with tough sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, a law originally passed by Congress with the intent of punishing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies after the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, who had been investigating corruption in Russia. In a post on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the sanctions had been imposed \u201cfor serious human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "What are the alleged human rights abuses? De Moraes has been overseeing the case against Bolsonaro, who is charged along with some 30 others \u2014 including the former commander of Brazil\u2019s navy, the former defense minister and the former intelligence chief \u2014 with trying to stage a coup to prevent the current president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from taking office after he defeated Bolsonaro in a 2022 election.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Court has ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and not go on social media, call foreign leaders or leave the country pending his trial. Three Brazilian officials noted to NBC News that the penalty was imposed after one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian congressman visiting the U.S., worked to enlist Steve Bannon and other MAGA allies to get Trump\u2019s attention and advocate to put pressure on Brazil over his father\u2019s case.",
      "De Moraes also ordered a ban in Brazil of the social media platform X, which is owned by sometime Trump ally Elon Musk, that lasted for more than a month last year after Musk and X refused to appoint a legal representative for their business in the country or to comply with court orders and requests to remove certain accounts and posts associated with election misinformation.",
      "And Trump\u2019s own social media company, Trump Media, has sued de Moraes over a suspension order he issued to the video hosting company Rumble, which Trump Media uses for its Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cThe way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace. This Trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d Trump said in a letter that he sent to Brazil\u2019s president, who is widely known as Lula, and posted to Truth Social on July 9.",
      "Trump\u2019s letter went on to tie Bolsonaro\u2019s prosecution and de Moraes\u2019 social media rulings to the tariffs he\u2019d later impose: \u201cDue in part to Brazil\u2019s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans (as lately illustrated by the Brazilian Supreme Court, which has issued hundreds of SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders to U.S. Social Media platforms, threatening them with Millions of Dollars in Fines and Eviction from the Brazilian Social Media market), starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Brazil a Tariff of 50% on any and all Brazilian products sent into the United States.\u201d",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy, exports popular commodities like coffee, beef, oranges, aircraft, oil, iron and steel to the U.S. Trump\u2019s executive order excluded some products, including oranges, oil and fertilizers, but not coffee or beef.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions against Brazil have brought the country\u2019s opposing political sides together to some extent.",
      "A delegation including Bolsonaro supporters and a former opposition Cabinet member from Brazil\u2019s foreign relations and defense committee met in Washington this week with Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis to try to iron out the dispute.",
      "Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also flew to Washington to meet with Rubio on Wednesday. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick talked by phone with his Brazilian counterpart, two of the Brazilian officials told NBC News. They also said the call did not go well.",
      "Lula has not yet announced whether or how Brazil will retaliate against the U.S. tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court panel heard arguments on a challenge to Trump\u2019s authority to impose tariffs by executive order brought by businesses and a coalition of state attorneys general. Tariff opponents argue the White House has not established that a national emergency exists to justify Trump\u2019s circumventing what is, with some emergency exceptions, supposed to be congressional authority over tariffs.",
      "Several of the judges on the panel pressed the Justice Department lawyer representing the government on the president\u2019s right to impose steep duties using an economic emergency law that does not specifically mention tariffs. No other president has ever tried to impose tariffs under the 1977 law the Trump administration is citing. The case is expected to eventually end up at the Supreme Court."

      "Anderson\u2019s daughter, Loralyn Willis, confirmed her death to NBC News on Friday and said her mother passed away on July 14 at a nursing home in Carlsbad, California.",
      "Anderson\u2019s story was largely unknown until the 2018 documentary \u201cHula Girl,\u201d which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Filmmakers Chris Riess and Amy Hill brought her story to light after Hill\u2019s mother overheard it in a restaurant.",
      "Born Joan Constance Manning on Dec. 28, 1923, in Sydney, Australia, she met her husband, U.S. pilot Wayne Anderson, at Bondi Beach in 1946. They married four months later, moved to the U.S. and eventually settled in Hollywood, where Joan worked as a model, according to a biography on a website for \u201cHula Girl.\u201d",
      "While visiting family in Australia in the 1950s, Anderson noticed a toy hoop craze sweeping the country. Curious, she asked her mother to send her one. When it arrived, even the deliveryman questioned why it had come so far. According to the documentary, Joan and Wayne played with it for months before showing it to friends. At a dinner party, someone commented that it looked like doing the hula, to which Joan replied, \u201cThere\u2019s the name \u2014 hula hoop.\u201d",
      "The couple introduced the hoop to Arthur \u201cSpud\u201d Melin, the co-founder of Wham-O. The meeting was informal \u2014 no paperwork, just a handshake, according to Anderson.",
      "\u201cWe were very naive,\u201d Anderson said in \u201cHula Girl.\u201d Wham-O went on to make millions. The Andersons sued and settled in 1961 for under $6,000 after legal fees.",

      "As the saying goes, what\u2019s old often becomes new again. And millennials, typically defined as individuals born between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s, are now at a point in their lives where their generational nostalgia is front and center.",
      "This recent surge in millennial-focused pop culture serves as \u201cthe next level of escapism\u201d for the generation, said Kate Kennedy, author of \u201cOne in a Millennial: On Friendship, Feelings, Fangirls, and Fitting In.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt returns us to a time when our biggest worry was getting in line for a CD, not whether we would be able to afford a house,\u201d Kennedy said.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A 12-year-old Chinese swimmer has become a global sensation with her history-making times, even as observers and fans back home caution against overhyping the young athlete.",
      "On Thursday, Yu Zidi became the youngest-ever medalist at the World Aquatics Championships, which are being held in Singapore this year.",
      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",
      "Yu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, could earn an individual medal on Sunday in the women\u2019s 400-meter medley. Her times are so fast that they allowed her to compete at the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.",
      "She has already come close to medaling in two other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter medley on Monday and 0.31 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter butterfly on Thursday.",
      "At the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.",
      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Katie Ledecky of the United States and Summer McIntosh of Canada, with times that would have put her on the verge of medaling at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Already, Yu is swimming the 400-meter individual medley about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",
      "But sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.",
      "\u201cI never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,\u201d he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him \u201csevere\u201d mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.",
      "Since sports prodigies naturally attract followers, fan groups could also be a concern for Yu in the future, said Zhang, who was at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.",
      "China is often overprotective of its athletes, but it \u201cmay not be a good thing if Yu is living in isolation like protected giant pandas,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor athletes, learning to interact with the media is a necessary part of their development,\u201d Zhang added.",
      "Jessie Zhou, 23, a graduate student in Hong Kong who closely follows table tennis star Fan, said it was a \u201cgood call\u201d for Chinese media to cover Yu in a \u201crestrained tone\u201d while extreme sports fandom remains unresolved.",
      "\u201cJust let the kid stay focused on training,\u201d Zhou said."

      "Rausch said the suspect showed a sign of compassion \u2014 dropping the child off \u2014 so \"there is hope for him to be able to come in and have a conversation about what happened.\u201d"

Fox News ultimately reached a $787.5 million settlement with Dominion in 2023.",

      "The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History will once again mention President Donald Trump in an exhibit on presidential impeachments after the removal of a placard noting his two Senate trials sparked concerns this week over the White House's influence on the institution.",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Smithsonian detailed its decision to remove the Trump placard from the \"Impeachment\" section of an exhibit titled \"The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden,\" saying the decision was not influenced by politics, but rather the conditions of the placard.",
      "\"The placard, which was meant to be a temporary addition to a 25-year-old exhibition, did not meet the museum\u2019s standards in appearance, location, timeline, and overall presentation,\" the Smithsonian's Saturday statement read. \"It was not consistent with other sections in the exhibit and moreover blocked the view of the objects inside its case. For these reasons, we removed the placard.\"",
      "The \"Impeachment\" section of the exhibit \"will be updated in the coming weeks to reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation\u2019s history,\" the Smithsonian said.",
      "The Washington Post was the first to report on the changes to the exhibit.",

      "In its statement, the Smithsonian said it was \"not asked by any Administration or other government official to remove content from the exhibit.\"",
      "\u201cThe American Presidency: A Glorious Burden\u201d exhibit was created in 2000 and hasn\u2019t been formally updated since 2008, a spokesperson for the Smithsonian told NBC News on Thursday. In lieu of an update, which the museum indicated would be costly, the Smithsonian in 2021 affixed a placard noting Trump's two impeachments to the exhibit.",
      "\u201cIt was intended to be a short-term measure to address current events at the time, however, the label remained in place until July 2025,\" the spokesperson said Thursday.",
      "Because the exhibit, which also covers Congress and the Supreme Court, hadn\u2019t been updated since 2008, the museum decided to restore the \u201cImpeachment\u201d section of the gallery \u201cback to its 2008 appearance,\" the spokesperson said at the time.",
      "The decision to remove the Trump label drew criticism from lawmakers, particularly as Trump has sought to exert his influence over the Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums, nine research centers and a zoo.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Friday accused Trump of attempting to \"rewrite history.\"",
      "\"He is censoring the American History Museum. It\u2019s Orwellian. It\u2019s downright Orwellian. It\u2019s something you\u2019d see in an authoritarian regime,\" Schumer said. \"Here\u2019s my message to the president: no matter what exhibits you try to distort, the American people will never forget that you were impeached not once, but twice.\"",
      "Trump has called for a reimagining of the Smithsonian, accusing the cultural institution in March of coming \u201cunder the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology\u201d and signing an executive order to \u201crestore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.\u201d In that order, Trump directed Vice President JD Vance to work with the Smithsonian's Board of Regents to \"remove improper ideology\" from the museums.",
      "Trump also barred spending on exhibits or programs \"that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.\"",
      "Last week, artist Amy Sherald said she withdrew her exhibit from the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery after concerns were raised about a portrait she featured of a transgender woman dressed like the Statue of Liberty.",
      "\"I was informed by the National Portrait Gallery that concerns had been raised internally about the museum\u2019s inclusion of a portrait of a trans woman titled Trans Forming Liberty. These concerns led to discussions about removing the work from the exhibition,\" Sherald said in a statement. \"I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Smithsonian disputed Sherald's characterization of the incident, arguing that the artist was not asked to remove the painting, but rather the museum wanted to contextualize the portrait through a video featuring differing opinions of it.",
      "\"The Smithsonian strives to foster a greater and shared understanding. By presenting and contextualizing art, the Smithsonian aims to inspire, challenge and impact audiences in meaningful and thoughtful ways. Unfortunately, we could not come to an agreement with the artist,\" the spokesperson said."

      "Anderson\u2019s story was largely unknown until the 2018 documentary \u201cHula Girl,\u201d which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Filmmakers Chris Riess and Amy Hill brought her story to light after Hill\u2019s mother overheard it in a restaurant.",
      "Born Joan Constance Manning on Dec. 28, 1923, in Sydney, Australia, she met her husband, U.S. pilot Wayne Anderson, at Bondi Beach in 1946. They married four months later, moved to the U.S. and eventually settled in Hollywood, where Joan worked as a model, according to a biography on a website for \u201cHula Girl.\u201d",
      "While visiting family in Australia in the 1950s, Anderson noticed a toy hoop craze sweeping the country. Curious, she asked her mother to send her one. When it arrived, even the deliveryman questioned why it had come so far. According to the documentary, Joan and Wayne played with it for months before showing it to friends. At a dinner party, someone commented that it looked like doing the hula, to which Joan replied, \u201cThere\u2019s the name \u2014 hula hoop.\u201d",
      "The couple introduced the hoop to Arthur \u201cSpud\u201d Melin, the co-founder of Wham-O. The meeting was informal \u2014 no paperwork, just a handshake, according to Anderson.",
      "\u201cWe were very naive,\u201d Anderson said in \u201cHula Girl.\u201d Wham-O went on to make millions. The Andersons sued and settled in 1961 for under $6,000 after legal fees.",
      "\u201cThey never acknowledged who gave them the hula hoop,\u201d Anderson said in the film. \u201cI think that bugged me more than anything.\"",

It\u2019s just a life well lived. It\u2019s living your best life in spite of a setback.\u201d",

      "The Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Law Enforcement Center said the closure includes \"Barker Lake and surrounding area.\"",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-brazilian-products-tariffs-bolsonaro-rcna222534",
    "published": "Sat, 02 Aug 2025 16:13:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Brazilian products are subject to a 50% tariff not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of Trump\u2019s relationship with Brazil's former president.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Products imported to the U.S. from Brazil \u2014 including almost a third of the supply relied on every day by America\u2019s coffee drinkers \u2014 are subject to a 50% tariff beginning Friday, not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with the country\u2019s former strongman president Jair Bolsonaro, and because of the actions of one of the justices of Brazil\u2019s supreme court.",
      "Trump typically justifies his tariffs by pointing to the U.S. trade deficit and saying that other nations are taking advantage of the United States. Many economists disagree with his view, but it doesn\u2019t matter in this instance: The U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Brazil of hundreds of billions of dollars over more than a decade, not a deficit.",
      "Still, on Friday, Trump imposed a total 50% tariff on certain products imported from Brazil, the highest rate of any country in the world.",
      "Earlier this week, the Trump administration also slapped the supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, with tough sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, a law originally passed by Congress with the intent of punishing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies after the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, who had been investigating corruption in Russia. In a post on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the sanctions had been imposed \u201cfor serious human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "What are the alleged human rights abuses? De Moraes has been overseeing the case against Bolsonaro, who is charged along with some 30 others \u2014 including the former commander of Brazil\u2019s navy, the former defense minister and the former intelligence chief \u2014 with trying to stage a coup to prevent the current president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from taking office after he defeated Bolsonaro in a 2022 election.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Court has ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and not go on social media, call foreign leaders or leave the country pending his trial. Three Brazilian officials noted to NBC News that the penalty was imposed after one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian congressman visiting the U.S., worked to enlist Steve Bannon and other MAGA allies to get Trump\u2019s attention and advocate to put pressure on Brazil over his father\u2019s case.",
      "De Moraes also ordered a ban in Brazil of the social media platform X, which is owned by sometime Trump ally Elon Musk, that lasted for more than a month last year after Musk and X refused to appoint a legal representative for their business in the country or to comply with court orders and requests to remove certain accounts and posts associated with election misinformation.",
      "And Trump\u2019s own social media company, Trump Media, has sued de Moraes over a suspension order he issued to the video hosting company Rumble, which Trump Media uses for its Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cThe way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace. This Trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d Trump said in a letter that he sent to Brazil\u2019s president, who is widely known as Lula, and posted to Truth Social on July 9.",
      "Trump\u2019s letter went on to tie Bolsonaro\u2019s prosecution and de Moraes\u2019 social media rulings to the tariffs he\u2019d later impose: \u201cDue in part to Brazil\u2019s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans (as lately illustrated by the Brazilian Supreme Court, which has issued hundreds of SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders to U.S. Social Media platforms, threatening them with Millions of Dollars in Fines and Eviction from the Brazilian Social Media market), starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Brazil a Tariff of 50% on any and all Brazilian products sent into the United States.\u201d",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy, exports popular commodities like coffee, beef, oranges, aircraft, oil, iron and steel to the U.S. Trump\u2019s executive order excluded some products, including oranges, oil and fertilizers, but not coffee or beef.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions against Brazil have brought the country\u2019s opposing political sides together to some extent.",
      "A delegation including Bolsonaro supporters and a former opposition Cabinet member from Brazil\u2019s foreign relations and defense committee met in Washington this week with Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis to try to iron out the dispute.",
      "Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also flew to Washington to meet with Rubio on Wednesday. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick talked by phone with his Brazilian counterpart, two of the Brazilian officials told NBC News. They also said the call did not go well.",
      "Lula has not yet announced whether or how Brazil will retaliate against the U.S. tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court panel heard arguments on a challenge to Trump\u2019s authority to impose tariffs by executive order brought by businesses and a coalition of state attorneys general. Tariff opponents argue the White House has not established that a national emergency exists to justify Trump\u2019s circumventing what is, with some emergency exceptions, supposed to be congressional authority over tariffs.",
      "Several of the judges on the panel pressed the Justice Department lawyer representing the government on the president\u2019s right to impose steep duties using an economic emergency law that does not specifically mention tariffs. No other president has ever tried to impose tariffs under the 1977 law the Trump administration is citing. The case is expected to eventually end up at the Supreme Court."

      "We don\u2019t always have the answers, but we have some people on speed dial who do \u2014 which is why we present to you our series FYI where we have experts explain if lip balm is actually bad, how often you should wash your hair and more.",
      "French onion soup? Delicious. Adding a grilled onion to your burger? Chef\u2019s kiss. The latest TikTok trend? Incorporating onions into a hair care routine. Yup, you read that right. Onion extract in shampoo may actually be beneficial for your strands, according to experts.",
      "\u201cOnions are naturally antimicrobial while rich in sulfur and antioxidants so there is truth in onion being potentially helpful as an ingredient in hair products,\u201d says Dr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. Because of this, there are a number of shampoos on the market that list onion extract as one of their primary ingredients.",
      "Below, we spoke to experts about the potential benefits associated with onion shampoo, whether you can use it if you have color-treated hair and more \u2014 plus, gathered a few highly rated options for you to shop.",
      "What is onion shampoo?",
      "Onion shampoo is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 shampoo that has onion as a main ingredient. Though it may sound funky, the experts we spoke to agree that onion extract can help hair health. \u201cOnion contains sulfur, which is a key building block for keratin, the protein that makes up your hair,\u201d says Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon at Kopelman Hair Restoration. \u201cIt also has antimicrobial properties that can support a healthier scalp environment. Some studies suggest it may increase blood flow to the scalp and reduce inflammation, which are both important for hair health.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, hair products with this vegetable are aimed at helping with hair thinning and encouraging growth. One clinical trial even found that when onion extract was applied topically, it helped people with alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss) with regrowth. \u201cWhile we need more research, I\u2019ve seen some patients benefit when using onion-based treatments as part of a broader hair care routine,\u201d says Kopelman.",
      "The perks may sound great, but worried that onion shampoo will leave you smelling like the deli counter? Don\u2019t be. While onion extract may be a primary ingredient, the shampoos available that use it also have other beneficial (and pleasant-smelling) ingredients, such as lavender or rosemary.",
      "Can anyone use onion shampoo?",
      "In general, over-the-counter shampoos with onion extract are gentle and sulfate-free, so they should be safe for just about everyone to use. That said, if you have color-treated hair, you may want to think twice. \u201cOnions are acidic, so using them on color-treated hair can disrupt the delicate PH balance needed to prolong the look of freshly colored hair,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cAvoiding the shaft of the treated hair and concentrating at the scalp is an option but be sure to patch test to ensure you don\u2019t have any scalp sensitivity.\u201d",
      "Chacon also recommends that those with sensitive skin proceed with caution. \u201cThe smell could also be a hindrance here as well as the effect onions have on the eyes and the close proximity of the scalp to the eyes,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cInstead, I would opt for rosemary oil \u2014 which is an alternative natural ingredient that has all of the antifungal, growth promoting effects but with a pleasant scent.\u201d",
      "Finally, if you are allergic to anything in the allium family (like onions or garlic), it\u2019s best to skip this type of shampoo. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few cases of contact dermatitis from poorly formulated onion shampoos,\u201d says Kopelman. \u201cAlso, if you have eczema or active scalp inflammation, it\u2019s best to consult with a specialist before adding anything new to your regimen.\u201d",

    "summary": "Brands are already raising prices, so experts recommend buying tech, household basics, clothing and baby gear before costs go up even more.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s almost impossible to avoid tariff-related price hikes while shopping. A universal 10% tariff on all countries has been in effect since April, and over 100 countries could soon face higher reciprocal tariffs if they don\u2019t reach a trade agreement with the U.S. before Aug. 1.",
      "Since the trade war is expected to heat up even more in the coming weeks, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re suddenly paying more for clothes, tech, household basics and groceries. That said, there\u2019s still time to save \u2014 tariffs only apply to imported goods, so prices on products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t currently shooting up. Once that supply runs out, however, many brands will have no choice but to raise prices, including those that already did a first round of hikes earlier this year.",
      "Below, I spoke with experts about what they recommend buying before tariffs have a significant impact on your shopping cart. They also responded to frequently asked questions about tariffs and shared tips for saving money.",

      "What to buy as tariff-related price hikes roll out",
      "We don\u2019t know what the exact impacts of tariffs will be, but one thing is for sure: almost everything you buy is getting more expensive, says Dr. Ross Steinman, a professor of consumer psychology at Widener University. That doesn\u2019t mean you should panic buy \u2014 it does, however, mean that now is the best time to purchase anything on your wishlist or that you\u2019ve been saving up for. It\u2019s crucial to focus on higher-cost items produced abroad, like tech, appliances, furniture and cars, as well as clothing, shoes and household basics like groceries and cleaning supplies, says Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty.",
      "A few things to keep in mind: First, as I said above, tariffs only apply to imported goods, so the price of products currently in U.S. warehouses aren\u2019t shooting up.  But it\u2019s only a matter of time before that stock runs low and companies have to import more goods, which will be subject to the new tariff rates. We\u2019re also already seeing brands across industries raise prices or warn customers about impending hikes, including big names like Nike, Black+Decker and Fabletics. And with the threat of higher duties looming, companies that already raised prices could do so again.",
      "Also, remember that even if a product is manufactured in the U.S., tariffs are causing companies to face higher production costs. They often import materials like fabric, batteries and microchips from foreign countries, so expect increased prices on American-made goods, too.",
      "Below, I rounded up examples of products you should consider buying before more tariff-related price hikes roll out. They\u2019re all manufactured in places subject to universal tariffs or higher country-specific duties.",
      "Basics and groceries",
      "Tide Pods Liquid Laundry Detergent (76-Count)",
      "During a recent earnings call, Procter & Gamble\u2019s CEO said shoppers will start seeing price hikes from its brands this summer, including Tide, which has manufacturing plants in the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These laundry detergent pods have a color protector, odor fighter and stain remover inside. They dissolve quickly in cool or warm water, according to Tide.",
      "Bounty Paper Towels",
      "Procter & Gamble also owns the paper goods brand Bounty, which, similar to Tide, makes its products across the U.S. but may import ingredients, materials and packaging from abroad. These paper towels are absorbent so you can quickly soak up messes. Rolls come pre-measured, letting you tear off small or large sheets along the perforated lines.",
      "Kosterina Original Extra Virgin Olive Oil",
      "Kosterina harvests Koroneiki olives in Greece to make this extra-virgin olive oil. Before the price of this pantry staple increases due to the 15% tariff imposed on countries part of the European Union, consider buying a couple of bottles. The EVOO, which I use for sauteing, roasting and making dressings, has a buttery, peppery flavor.",
      "Technology",
      "Apple AirPods 4 with ANC",
      "Apple makes most of its hardware in China and produces devices like iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods in India and Vietnam. NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who tested Apple\u2019s AirPods 4 for two months, says they\u2019re a small, comfortable pair you can rely on daily. \u201cThese are the best earbuds for anyone who hates the feeling of rubber eartips clogging their eardrums,\u201d he says. \u201cThey also have new features like dust and water resistance, and adaptive audio, which automatically switches between noise cancellation modes.\u201d",
      "JBL Clip 5",
      "The JBL Clip 5, which is made in China, is our team\u2019s go-to Bluetooth speaker \u2014 the audio quality is impressive for the device\u2019s size, and its built-in carabiner clip lets you attach it to bags, bikes, beach umbrellas, bathroom towel rods and more. You can use the speaker for up to 12 hours before needing to recharge it, according to the brand. The Clip 5 is also dust- and water-resistant.",
      "Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con",
      "While Nintendo didn\u2019t raise the price of the Switch 2 prior to its launch in June, the company, which makes most of its products in Asia, marked up related accessories. It also said \u201cother adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are possible in the future, depending on market conditions.\u201d",
      "The original Switch is beloved among the NBC Select staff, and if it\u2019s on your wishlist, we recommend buying it soon \u2014 its price could increase at any point, and it\u2019s more readily available compared to the frequently out-of-stock Switch 2. This handheld gaming console has two detachable Joy-Con controllers and three play modes: TV, handheld and tabletop. It\u2019s also designed with built-in motion controls that immerse you in games.",
      "Google Pixel Watch 3",
      "Most Google Pixel products are made in China and Vietnam, like the Pixel Watch 3, which won an NBC Select Wellness Award. Rabinowitz says it\u2019s Google\u2019s best smartwatch yet, although it\u2019s only compatible with Android phones (which are also likely to increase in price soon). It has fitness tracking features, including the ability to automatically log workouts and build custom runs. The water-resistant watch has a 24-hour battery life, according to the brand, and collects data about your sleep.",
      "Clothes and shoes",
      "Gap Organic Cotton VintageSoft T-Shirt",
      "I buy basics from Gap every time they\u2019re on sale, including this 100% cotton T-shirt, which is made in India. The shirt has a soft, loose feel, short sleeves and a crewneck. It runs true-to-size, in my experience. I typically wear it tucked into a pair of jeans, and in the colder months, I throw a cardigan over it.",
      "501\u00ae Original Fit Men's Jeans",
      "These Levi\u2019s jeans, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, are produced in China, but the brand makes and sources apparel from across the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing a pair of Levi\u2019s 501\u2019s for over 6 years now,\u201d says NBC Select editor Jordan Bowman. \u201cI love the classic, straight fit because it works for almost every outfit, and the cut is honestly timeless. There\u2019s a reason these are one of most iconic pairs of denim of all time.\u201d",
      "Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings",
      "Lululemon, which makes and sources products from across the world, raised prices on a small portion of its merchandise this summer. According to an earnings call, the hikes were \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201cstrategic.\u201d The brand didn\u2019t specify exactly what products increased in price, or whether customers should expect additional increases in the future. Lululemon\u2019s Wunder Train High-Rise Leggings are my all-time favorite pair for high-intensity workouts like running, as well as strength training. They have two side pockets, a hidden pocket in the waistband and a waistband drawcord.",
      "Adidas Samba OG Sneaker",
      "Adidas, which primarily makes its shoes in Asia and Germany, will eventually raise prices on its U.S. products, according to the brand, which did not disclose how much increases will be or what items will be affected. These are some of Adidas\u2019 most classic sneakers for men and women. The Samba has a leather upper, synthetic fabric lining and grippy rubber outsole.",
      "Birkenstock Arizona",
      "Birkenstock, which makes products at its factories in Germany, plans to raise prices globally to offset tariffs at some point before September. The brand\u2019s Arizona slip-on sandal for men and women has two adjustable straps and a cork footbed. There\u2019s also a deep heel cup to keep your foot secure, as well as a raised toe bar to encourage the natural gripping motion of your feet, according to the brand.",
      "Under Armour Charged Surge 4 Sneaker",
      "During a recent earnings call, Under Armour, which sources products from countries like Vietnam, Jordan and Indonesia, shared that it\u2019s increasing prices on its apparel, shoes and accessories. We\u2019ve tested lots of Under Armour\u2019s activewear and sneakers over the years. The Charged Surge 4, available in men\u2019s and women\u2019s sizes, is a basic shoe that\u2019s great for walkers, runners and gym goers. It has a cushioned midsole to support feet and a grippy rubber outsole to stabilize you on various surfaces. The sneaker is also made with mesh to keep feet cool.",
      "Home and kitchen",
      "Ninja AF101 Air Fryer",
      "SharkNinja already raised prices on a handful of products in response to tariffs, and will continue to, according to a statement from the company\u2019s CEO during a recent earnings call. Almost every NBC Select staff member has a Ninja appliance in their kitchen, most of which are manufactured in China and Southeast Asia. While we love using the Creami to make frozen treats, we rely most on Ninja\u2019s basic kitchen gadgets, like blenders, air fryers and coffee machines. This air fryer is recommended by NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown, who appreciates that it\u2019s big enough to feed a few people,  yet compact enough to keep in her small kitchen. The appliance is easy to operate, and you can use it to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate ingredients. Its detachable parts are dishwasher-safe, according to the brand.",
      "Dyson Ball Animal 3 Extra Upright Vacuum",
      "We recommend Dyson\u2019s vacuums, which are made in countries like China and Malaysia, because they have superior suction and make cleaning all types of floors a breeze. If you have one on your wishlist, now is the time to buy \u2014 Dyson\u2019s vacuums are hundreds of dollars, so potential price increases could put them out of your budget. The Ball Animal 3 Extra upright vacuum is designed to clean large homes with pets. It has a detangling brushhead, three cleaning modes and a built-in filtration system, plus it comes with multiple accessories, including a pet grooming tool.",
      "Sproos! Handheld Showerhead with Filter Set",
      "In the spring, Sproos notified customers that it planned on holding prices steady for the time being. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on increases, which we haven\u2019t seen yet \u2014 that means now is the best time to invest in one of the brand\u2019s filtered showerheads. This set comes with a handheld fixture that has a replaceable filter and three spray modes. Everything you need for installation is included, including steel pliers and step-by-step instructions.",
      "Ikea Kallax Shelf Unit",
      "Ikea\u2019s furniture and home goods are centered around Swedish and Scandinavian designs, but they\u2019re manufactured worldwide. Rabinowitz\u2019s favorite Ikea piece is this shelf, which he has a larger version of. \u201cThis storage shelf has moved with me across three apartments in New York City \u2014 it\u2019s outlasted couches, mattresses, bed frames and TV stands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to wow anyone aesthetically, but it is extremely practical.\u201d",
      "Casper Original Hybrid Mattress",
      "Many brands, including Casper, assemble their mattresses in the U.S.. Still, they import materials like fabrics, foam and springs from overseas \u2014 that could lead to increased production costs for companies, and, in turn, increased prices for shoppers.",
      "NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio recommends Casper\u2019s Original Hybrid Mattress if you need to upgrade soon. \u201cI bought this mattress in 2021 and it still feels brand new years later,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s semi-firm, which is perfect for my husband and I since we tend to have different preferences. I\u2019m really picky about my mattresses because I\u2019m a very hot sleeper, but this one manages to feel fairly cool and doesn\u2019t trap heat, in my experience.\u201d",
      "Baby gear",
      "Uppababy Aria Infant Car Seat",
      "The cost of baby gear like strollers and car seats, much of which is produced overseas, is up 20% on average since January, according to BabyCenter, a digital parenting resource. Uppababy raised prices across most of its products a few months ago, so if you\u2019re in the market for one of the brand\u2019s strollers, car seats, high chairs, changing backpacks or bouncers, buy it before another round of hikes happen. Rabinowitz used the brand\u2019s Aria car seat to travel with his newborn, and he still uses the brand\u2019s Vista V2 stroller with his now 1-year-old. He recommends buying from Uppababy if you\u2019re looking for high quality pieces and peace of mind as a parent.",
      "Coterie Monthly Diaper Box",
      "Coterie already increased the price of its monthly diaper box by $5, and the price of its 4-pack of wipes by $3, per auto-review shipment. In an email to customers, the brand cited \u201cglobal economic factors and rising material costs\u201d as the reason for the hike.",
      "Rabinowitz started buying the brand\u2019s diapers when his baby was born last year. \u201cUsing Coterie\u2019s diapers make me feel good as a parent because they work really well and don\u2019t have ingredients that I\u2019m skeptical of, like a lot of plastic and perfumes,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cThe subscription is easy to use and very flexible \u2014 if I\u2019m scheduled to get diapers in five weeks but I need them in two, I can move up my shipment date.\u201d",
      "Bugaboo Butterfly 2 Travel Stroller",
      "Similar to Uppababy, Bugaboo raised prices across its baby gear earlier this year. Select products were impacted, but the brand didn\u2019t specify which ones \u2014 if you have your eye on something, buy it before its price goes up. NBC senior photo editor Becca Delman, a soon-to-be mom of three, highly recommends Bugaboo\u2019s compact travel stroller. \u201cThe Butterfly 2 works so well for my 10-month old and 3.5-year old,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lightweight, I can fold it with one hand and it\u2019s easy to clean. The lay-flat feature is also great for my new baby when he arrives in November.\u201d",
      "Will retailers raise prices due to tariffs?",
      "Yes, in addition to individual brands, some retailers plan to start pricing their merchandise higher due to tariffs. Here are a few we know about right now:",

      "Tariff rates are constantly changing as the U.S. government negotiates deals with its trading partners globally. In addition to the tariffs below, all of which are currently in effect, numerous countries could soon be subject to high reciprocal tariffs once a pause expires on Aug. 1. China and Mexico are also in ongoing talks with the U.S. about tariffs \u2014 China's pause on duties expires on Aug. 12 and Mexico's pause expires at the end of October.",

      "Tariffs will eventually raise prices for U.S. consumers, but so far, the impact is muted, says Ales. Generally speaking, prices haven\u2019t changed much across industries since duties first went into effect in April \u2014 that won\u2019t be the case forever though. \u201cCompanies did a lot of stocking up in advance of tariffs, creating an inventory that\u2019s almost like a shock absorber to prevent some of the price changes,\u201d says Ales. \u201cBut eventually, that inventory runs out, and as companies get used to this new landscape, they\u2019ll begin to sit down and figure out how to adjust to it.\u201d",
      "Since tariffs are higher under the current Trump administration, brands need to find ways to pay increased duties while continuing to make a profit. Raising prices on their products, or adding an additional fee at checkout, is a route many will take. \u201cThe tariff needs to be absorbed by someone \u2014 is it the business or the consumer?,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly, but most likely, there will be some absorption occurring at the consumer level.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of prices and costs going up, it appears that it\u2019s going to be almost universal,\u201d says Steinman. \u201cRight now, it seems like it\u2019s not going to be specific to any one category or industry.\u201d That said, price hikes will likely be the most noticeable among categories like groceries, vehicles and auto parts, clothing, shoes, electronics, appliances, furniture and home goods, says Porwal.",
      "There\u2019s no standard amount by which tariffs will raise prices on consumer goods, says Tala Akhavan, the COO of Pietra, an AI-powered sourcing platform that works with e-commerce brands. Companies large and small are approaching price hikes individually and using different strategies to adjust to their new reality. For example, some are splitting the burden of increased duties between customers and themselves, others are fully eating costs and finding new manufacturers, and a select few are putting all tariff fees onto customers, says Akhavan. The strategy a brand takes plays a large part in how much it increases its prices by.",
      "Long story short: consumers should expect to pay more for goods right now, says Akhavan. \u201cSo far, brands that are raising prices seem to be keeping them that way. There\u2019s so much opacity around how the tariff situation is going to play out, and as a bit of insurance, brands are keeping their prices elevated, especially since they\u2019re accepting the volatility around tariffs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say where tariffs are going to land in the long term, but for the most part, I don\u2019t see a world where we go back to exactly where we were.\u201d",
      "Yes, tariffs are likely to increase prices on products manufactured in the U.S. as well as overseas, says Ales. Many domestically-made goods rely on imported materials, packing and machinery, all of which cost more now.",

    "story": [
      "Two years before he was arrested in the killings of two Arkansas hikers, Andrew J. McGann was known to some parents at a Texas elementary school for his pattern of off-putting behavior around their kids.",
      "Lindsay Camp Polyak, whose son would spend some days in McGann\u2019s classroom at Donald Elementary School in the town of Flower Mound, said she and other parents grew concerned that he was not properly teaching their children and felt they were falling behind academically. She also noticed what she characterized as McGann\u2019s \u201cgrooming\u201d of girls in the classroom.",
      "\u201cMy kid would come home and say, \u2018Mr. McGann loves to play tag. He plays tag at recess every day with the girls,\u2019\u201d Polyak said, adding that her son told her McGann gave out candy and special prizes \u2014 but only to the girls.",
      "In a group chat with other fourth grade parents, Polyak said she learned that McGann arranged \u201cspecial lunches\u201d where certain girls would remain in his classroom; some parents alleged McGann encouraged girls to sit on his lap.",
      "Details about McGann\u2019s background as a teacher emerged after authorities arrested him in the fatal stabbings of a couple at Arkansas\u2019 Devil\u2019s Den State Park on July 26. Officials believe McGann, 28, fatally stabbed Clinton David Brink, 43, and his wife, Cristen Amanda Brink, 42, in front of their 7- and 9-year-old daughters.",
      "McGann\u2019s motive remains a mystery. Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters Thursday that officials have \u201cno reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspect and our victims.\u201d Arkansas authorities do not believe the Brinks\u2019 young daughters were the intended targets of what appears to have been a random attack.",
      "Polyak learned about McGann\u2019s arrest at a barbershop after a parent sent her a link to a news article. \u201cI was like, holy s---, this is McGann, this is the guy who was teaching my kid,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had no business being around our children.\u201d",
      "Megan Perkins, another parent whose child attended Donald Elementary, described McGann as \u201codd.\u201d She recalled that he was unnecessarily competitive with the kids during field day athletic contests. She said other parents would chat about his strange behavior, though not everyone was necessarily alarmed and some believed he was simply insecure as the new guy in the community.",
      "In a statement, the Lewisville Independent School District said McGann was \u201cplaced on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgement and student favoritism.\u201d The school district said an \u201cinternal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students.\u201d",
      "The Texas Education Agency said it had no record of state investigations into McGann, but placed a flag on his teaching certificate on Thursday following his arrest.",
      "McGann resigned from the school district in May 2023, Lewisville ISD said. He then moved back to Oklahoma, where he got a job as a fifth grade teacher at Spring Creek Elementary School in Broken Arrow for the 2023-24 school year.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, a woman whose son was in McGann\u2019s class at Spring Creek said he was \u201cpretty quiet, but all the kids loved him.\u201d",
      "The woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about potential harassment, said her son admired his teacher and started wearing polo shirts to school \u201cbecause that\u2019s how Mr. McGann dressed.\u201d McGann expressed an interest in wrestling, hiking and the outdoors, and at one point he started a running club for the kids.",
      "She noticed that McGann was frequently \u201cawkward around the parents\u201d and \u201cstruggled to make eye contact during parent-teacher conferences.\u201d He once joked that he taught elementary school students because he was \u201cafraid of adults,\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement, Oklahoma\u2019s Broken Arrow Public Schools said McGann \u201cvoluntarily resigned at the end of that year to pursue employment elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The district said there were \u201cno disciplinary actions taken against him during his time at Broken Arrow Public Schools, and nothing in his background or reference checks gave cause for concern during the interview process.\u201d",
      "McGann\u2019s next stop was Northwoods Fine Arts Academy in the Tulsa suburb of Sand Springs, where he worked during the 2024-25 school year. He again taught fifth grade and again \u201cresigned his position\u201d at the end of one academic year, Sand Springs Public Schools confirmed in a statement.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why McGann decided to relocate to Arkansas. But he had lined up another teaching job there, this time with Springdale Public Schools.",
      "On July 26, two weeks before the start of the school year, a hiker came across a grisly crime scene in Devil\u2019s Den State Park. The hiker found two girls alone on the trail, led them to safety, and then came across their parents, who had been stabbed to death, according to a preliminary report from the prosecutor\u2019s office for the state\u2019s 4th Judicial District.",
      "A man had been spotted leaving the trail with what appeared to be blood on his face before getting into a black sedan later determined to be a Kia Stinger, according to the report.",
      "The killings kicked off a manhunt that lasted four days before police tracked the Stinger to Springdale, where McGann was getting a haircut.",
      "The barber, Adriana Guadalupe Ruiz Avalos, said she got a strange feeling about him almost immediately.",
      "Ruiz Avalos said she tends to have a good read on the customers who stream into Lupita\u2019s, an unassuming family-owned beauty salon in the Arkansas town of Springdale. That\u2019s why her guard went up when a tense-faced 20-something in baggy khakis stepped into the salon on Wednesday afternoon and tersely asked for a high-fade haircut.",
      "Ruiz Avalos, 28, started snipping away but kept a close eye on her customer. She had been following news reports about the frantic search for the suspect in the Devil\u2019s Den killings. The man in front of her seemed timid, barely saying a word and keeping his head down.",
      "Roughly five minutes into the haircut, a law enforcement officer walked inside. He was looking for the driver of the car parked outside, and he had a few questions for Ruiz Avalos\u2019 quiet customer.",
      "Before long, McGann was handcuffed and taken away.",
      "Ruiz Avalos, who watches a lot of true-crime documentaries, made a point of keeping McGann\u2019s hair clippings on the floor in the event they could be useful to investigators hunting for DNA evidence. In the hours after his arrest, she had trouble calming down.",
      "\u201cI felt nauseous all night. I didn\u2019t fall asleep until 6 a.m. I was just thinking about them,\u201d Ruiz Avalos said, referring to the Brinks.",
      "The Brinks, like McGann, were recent transplants to Arkansas. They had moved to the state about three weeks ago, according to Clinton\u2019s sister, Katrina Hutchins.",
      "The family said Clinton and Cristen died \u201cprotecting their little girls.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey deserve justice,\u201d the family said in a brief statement.",
      "McGann has been booked on charges of capital murder, jail records show. Authorities said that McGann\u2019s DNA matched that found at the scene. He made statements to investigators \u201cindicating that he had committed these heinous acts.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Aug. 2, 2025 4:00 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the location of Spring Creek Elementary School. It is in Broken Arrow, not Oklahoma City."

      "He had been released on bond related to an incident that allegedly took place in prison, where he was serving time for aggravated robbery, Goodman said.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether Drummond, Brown or Thomas have retained legal counsel. The public defender\u2019s office for the judicial district that covers Lake and Dyer counties was not available to provide information late Saturday.",
      "Drummond is described as armed and dangerous, and anyone who spots him was asked to call 911.",
      "\u201cGetting Austin Drummond in custody is a priority,\u201d the U.S. Marshals Service said.",
      "Two vehicles associated with Drummond have been found, authorities said. A white 1988 Ford pickup with red side panels was located in Dyer County on Saturday, and authorities are asking anyone with security video of the truck to send it to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.",
      "Drummond's white 2016 Audi A3 was found abandoned Friday in Jackson, about 74 miles southeast of Tiptonville, the bureau said.",

      "A relative of the victims said Thursday in a Facebook post that the suspect has \u201cliterally been nothing short of amazing to us and our kids.\u201d According to the post, Drummond previously dated a sister of Rose.",
      "Rausch said the suspect showed a sign of compassion \u2014 dropping the child off \u2014 so \"there is hope for him to be able to come in and have a conversation about what happened.\u201d"

      "There have not been reports of injuries or of structural damage, said Jonathan Tytell, a geophysicist at the USGS.",
      "The earthquake has a preliminary depth of 10 kilometers, which is shallow relative to others that have happened on Earth, he said.",

      "Michelle Williams had a three-word mantra in her head before reuniting with Destiny\u2019s Child last month.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter Tour,\u201d which concluded in Las Vegas on July 26, included a surprise Destiny's Child reunion with Williams and Kelly Rowland, as well as performances by Shaboozey and Jay-Z.",
      "Williams reflected on the moment during a July 29 episode of her podcast \u201cChecking In with Michelle Williams,\u201d sharing the behind-the-scenes story about how the reunion came to be, including the last-minute rehearsals and decisions to be made about the performance itself.",
      "During the rehearsals, Williams said she had one past incident from decades prior at the top of mind that kept her on edge.",
      "\u201cI was trying to stay focused because y\u2019all know I still have trauma from falling on \u2018106 & Park,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI need y\u2019all to be my therapist about that too because every time I perform with the girls, it\u2019s in my head, \u2018Do not fall. Do not fall. Do not fall.\u2019\u201d",
      "Williams cited the incident from more than 20 years prior when Destiny\u2019s Child appeared on \u201c106 & Park\u201d to promote their final studio album, \u201cDestiny Fulfilled.\u201d",
      "While performing their song \u201cSoldier\u201d on the show, Williams, Rowland and Beyonc\u00e9 were walking down the stage in unison when Williams tripped and fell. The singer quickly recovered and stood back up before diving into the dance moves, though the incident left an impression on Williams over the years.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s still in my head,\u201d she added. \u201cSteps do frighten me.\u201d",
      "Williams noted that in the Broadway musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d she has to descend steps during the show, though she noted that she has \u201ctwo gorgeous men on the right of me and the left of me holding my hand\u201d to help her down.",
      "\u201cDid I rehearse them steps? Sure did,\u201d Williams said, referring to her \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d steps. \u201cAnd then when it came to, I was like \u2018Oh my gosh, you dummy. You let fear or lack of trust on that first step,\u2019 because y\u2019all I\u2019m not going to let social media do me, because if that were to happen and I fell, I would not be able to live that down for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Williams said the only aspect of the reunion performance she didn't like was her lack of trust in the steps, citing her experience starring in \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d for over a year between performances in Chicago and on Broadway in New York City.",
      "\u201cThere are certain aspects of that stage that I know, I\u2019m comfortable. I don\u2019t have to look at certain marks,\u201d she explained. \u201c There are certain things that I know that I can hit because I\u2019m at home on that stage. I\u2019m not at home on the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 stage, nope. And y\u2019all wasn\u2019t going to do me. So that\u2019s the only thing that I\u2019m like, \u2018You could have trusted that the steps were not going to let you down.\u2019\u201d",
      "Williams said that all of the necessary changes were made \u201cwardrobe wise\u201d to make sure she wouldn't tumble on the \u201cCowboy Carter Tour,\u201d including requesting for the fringe to be cut off of the pants she wore to reduce to risk of tripping and falling.",
      "Despite the fear of the moment she experienced, the singer said that everything fell back into place for the group, sharing, \u201cWe turned into little girls again, them teenage girls, those younger girls who just wanted to since, dance and travel the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd Beyonc\u00e9 was like \u2018Y\u2019all, let\u2019s have fun. We just going to go out there and have fun. Whatever happens, happens, but we\u2019re going to have fun,\u2019\u201d Williams added. \u201cI knew we were going to have fun, we always have fun, but when you come from Destiny\u2019s Child, and then when you see the level of excellence that Beyonc\u00e9 performs at, you step it up.\u201d",
      "There were no missed steps in sight during the reunion on the \u201cCowboy Carter Tour.\u201d",
      "The trio, who officially disbanded in 2006, were in lock step as they kicked off their performance with a synchronized strut to kick off \u201cLose My Breath.\u201d",
      "Their medley transitioned into Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d track \u201cEnergy,\u201d including the mute challenge from last tour, before ending with their hit single \u201cBootylicious.\u201d"

      "Matt Rife says he's taking on a new not-so-funny title: Legal guardian of the allegedly haunted Annabelle doll.",
      "The comedian, 29, said on social media Aug. 1 that he purchased the home of Ed and Lorraine Warren, which has served as an Occult Museum housing the doll.",
      "\u201cIf you know me, you know I\u2019m obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted,\u201d he captioned the post, in part. \u201cYou also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I\u2019m incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history.\u201d",
      "He said Ed and Lorraine Warren \"arguably put demonology and paranormal into the mainstream and are the very heart of some of the most famous haunted stories of all time.\"",
      "\u201cWe plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place,\u201d he added.",
      "Rife purchased the property with viral ghost hunter Elton Castee, both of whom are now the legal guardians of the museum's artifacts for \u201cat least five years,\u201d according to Rife.",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, New England Society for Psychic Research director Tony Spera, son-in-law of the famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, clarified that while Rife and Castee purchased the home, he and wife Judy Spera remain the owners of the artifacts. NESPR is a paranormal research group founded by the Warrens in 1952.",
      "\u201cAll of the artifacts, including the infamous Annabelle doll, are owned by Judy and myself,\u201d Spera said, later adding, \u201cWe have no plans to ever \u2018sell\u2019 the artifacts.\u201d",
      "Spera said they are leasing the artifacts to Rife and Castee in an agreement that lasts five years. He added that Rife and Castee have plans to open the museum \u201coff site\" from the Warrens' home.",

      "What Is the Annabelle Doll?",
      "The Annabelle doll came into popular culture with the release of a 2014 horror film, which follows the story of a possessed doll haunting a couple nearly to their death.",
      "But the real Annabelle doll was around long before the film \u2014 and prior to her first appearance in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Conjuring.\u201d",
      "According to a timeline from NESPR, a nursing student was gifted a Raggedy Ann doll in 1968, which she then shared with her roommate.",
      "The two subsequently \u201cnoticed strange occurrences with the doll\u201d in the apartment before a medium told them it was \u201cinhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle,\u201d the timeline shows.",
      "\u201cThe two roommates tried to accept the doll\u2019s spirit and please it only to have it reciprocate maliciousness and violent intent,\u201d the NESPR website says.",
      "Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren deemed the doll \u201cdemonically possessed\u201d and removed it from the house, per NESPR, which is funded by the Warrens' son-in-law Tony Spera. The couple then \u201cencased it in a glass box to contain the evil spirited entity.\u201d",
      "A representative from the NESPR did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rife's post about purchasing Ed and Lorraine Warren's home.",
      "What's Next for the Annabelle Doll?",
      "The Annabelle doll notably left the Warren house this year for the \u201cDevils on the Run Tour.\u201d The nationwide tour showed the Warrens\u2019 work and displayed Annabelle.",
      "During the tour, Dan Rivera, a paranormal investigator and handler for the Annabelle doll, died at 54 on July 13 in a Pennsylvania hotel. Adams County Chief Deputy Coroner Scott Pennewill noted \u201cnothing suspicious\u201d surrounded Rivera\u2019s death.",
      "Pennewill confirmed the Annabelle doll was not present at the scene, adding that Rivera was found alone. Rivera\u2019s cause of death has not been released, and at time, Pennewill said Rivera\u2019s autopsy results would likely be available within 60 to 90 days.",
      "The Annabelle doll is scheduled to appear at the Maine Paranormal & Horror Convention in Augusta on Sept. 6 and 7, per NESPR's website.",
      "After buying the Warrens\u2019 home, Rife and Castee, the doll\u2019s new \u201clegal guardians,\u201d said they plan to host \u201covernight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place.\u201d",
      "In a livestream announcing their purchase, Castee walked through the museum for his social media followers and said he wants people to visit to capture any paranormal events to aid in research."

      "In response, Craig called him out for being a \"manipulative liar\" in another Instagram story and received support from her \"Love Island USA\" castmates, as well as the series\u2019 host Ariana Madix, who unfollowed Rodriguez as well.",
      "\"Love Island USA\" alum and Craig's close friend Leah Kateb also shed some light on what might've happened between the couple when she posted a message on Instagram.",
      "She wrote, in part, \u201cPut a sock in it ChatGPT head---. Tell the truth for once! Racist, clout/money hungry and a scammer since DAY 1!!!!\u201d",
      "In an interview with Elite Daily, which took place in early July, Craig talked about her time with Rodriguez on the show and said the biggest challenge for them post-\"Love Island USA\" was them navigating the real world together.",
      "\"I always wonder what his life was like before all of this,\" she said."

      "Carson both executive produced and starred in the film, released Aug. 1 on Netflix. The movie follows Carson\u2019s character Anna as she moves to Oxford to study poetry for a year at the famous university.",

Jamie has already died, and she is on the adventure alone, imagining what it would be like if Jamie were with her.",
      "Carson says that this heartbreaking moment in the film is captured by one of the movie's many literary references.",
      "\u201cI always go back to one of the authors that we quote often. Alfred Tennyson once said, \u2018It\u2019s better to have loved than lost than never to have loved at all,\u201d Carson says. \u201cThat is such a timeless and profound truth that I think we\u2019re reminded of in this story.\u201d",
      "Carson added that dealing with the film\u2019s profound subject matter was a \u201cbeautiful challenge.\u201d One of her favorite parts of the film was how they handled its tragic ending with comedy.",
      "\u201cIt was so important that comedy was the thing that always grounded our film. I think in times of darkness and loss, comedy is often how we cope,\u201d Carson says. \u201cComedy is what makes even the deepest moments just hit even harder.\u201d",
      "Another literary reference that stuck with Carson was the Emily Dickinson she set as Anna\u2019s lock screen: \u201cForever is composed of now.\u201d",
      "\u201cLife exists in the messiness, in the moments, in the now. All we have is a succession of moments,\u201d Carson says. \u201cI love \u2018forever is composed of now.\u2019 I always go back to that.\u201d"

      "\"I didn't have the emotional intelligence that I have now,\" he said. \"Me today on 'The Bachelor' would have handled that differently,\" he said.",
      "Despite her initial hesitation, Rachel agreed to rekindle things with Clayton. She appeared visibly emotional during their conversation and confessed she had always wondered what might have happened had Clayton chosen her.",
      "\u201cI want to, but I\u2019m so scared to get hurt,\u201d she told him. \u201cLike, I\u2019m terrified.\u201d",
      "Clayton, in turn, insisted that he had grown emotionally since their last relationship, citing newfound self-awareness and a desire to \u201cdo it right this time.\u201d",
      "They left the conversation walking hand-in-hand. \"My mom is literally going to kill me,\" Rachel said.",
      "But concerns arose almost immediately. Contestants in the villa, including Ollie Sutherland (\"Love Is Blind UK\") and AD Smith (\"Love Is Blind\" Season 6), questioned whether Rachel was making the right decision, with Ollie saying he believed Rachel was a better match for Freddie.",
      "In Episode 4, their rekindled relationship began to unravel. Clayton, after winning a blindfold kissing challenge, went on a date with Sandy Gallagher (\"The Ultimatum\").",
      "A day after reassuring her, Clayton ended things with Rachel. \u201cOut of respect for you, I have to not drag something out,\u201d he said. \u201cMy intuition is telling me this isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d",
      "Rachel broke down: \"I can't do it again,\" she said. \"Why would you put me in this position? This is literally so mean.\"",
      "She told fellow castmates that Clayton has now ended things with her three times, all using nearly identical language. \u201cHe does not give a (expletive) about me,\u201d she said through tears.",
      "In Episode 5, Clayton expressed regret. \u201cI don\u2019t have the best reputation,\u201d he said in a confessional. \u201cAnd I\u2019m avoiding being the bad guy, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s doable after everything I\u2019ve put her through.\u201d",
      "He pulled Rachel aside for a final conversation, apologizing for reopening old wounds and saying he wished he had handled their reunion differently.",
      "\u201cYou are an incredible person,\u201d Clayton told her. \u201cAnd the last thing I want is for you to say your experience was soured by someone from your past \u2026 I\u2019ve hurt you enough.\u201d",
      "The conversation offered Rachel a moment of clarity. \u201cBreaking up for the third time is the closure I needed to finally move on \u2014 for life,\u201d she said in a confessional.",
      "Clayton exited the show shortly afterward. \"I feel my journey was meant to be exactly as what it ultimately led to,\" he said, saying he also has \"closure.\"",
      "Freddie, who had shown interest in Rachel early on, picked up on a shift after she reconnected with Clayton.",
      "Though respectful and understanding, he eventually turned his attention to another contestant, Madison Errichiello (\"Love Is Blind\" Season 8), after Rachel grew emotionally distant.",
      "\u201cI came here to do something different,\u201d Rachel said to Freddie earlier in the season. \u201cBut of course, Clayton and I \u2014 we have a lot of history.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 02 Aug 2025 16:13:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Brazilian products are subject to a 50% tariff not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of Trump\u2019s relationship with Brazil's former president.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Products imported to the U.S. from Brazil \u2014 including almost a third of the supply relied on every day by America\u2019s coffee drinkers \u2014 are subject to a 50% tariff beginning Friday, not because of Brazil\u2019s trade policies, but because of President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with the country\u2019s former strongman president Jair Bolsonaro, and because of the actions of one of the justices of Brazil\u2019s supreme court.",
      "Trump typically justifies his tariffs by pointing to the U.S. trade deficit and saying that other nations are taking advantage of the United States. Many economists disagree with his view, but it doesn\u2019t matter in this instance: The U.S. actually has a trade surplus with Brazil of hundreds of billions of dollars over more than a decade, not a deficit.",
      "Still, on Friday, Trump imposed a total 50% tariff on certain products imported from Brazil, the highest rate of any country in the world.",
      "Earlier this week, the Trump administration also slapped the supreme court justice, Alexandre de Moraes, with tough sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, a law originally passed by Congress with the intent of punishing Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies after the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, who had been investigating corruption in Russia. In a post on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the sanctions had been imposed \u201cfor serious human rights abuses.\u201d",
      "What are the alleged human rights abuses? De Moraes has been overseeing the case against Bolsonaro, who is charged along with some 30 others \u2014 including the former commander of Brazil\u2019s navy, the former defense minister and the former intelligence chief \u2014 with trying to stage a coup to prevent the current president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from taking office after he defeated Bolsonaro in a 2022 election.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Court has ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor and not go on social media, call foreign leaders or leave the country pending his trial. Three Brazilian officials noted to NBC News that the penalty was imposed after one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian congressman visiting the U.S., worked to enlist Steve Bannon and other MAGA allies to get Trump\u2019s attention and advocate to put pressure on Brazil over his father\u2019s case.",
      "De Moraes also ordered a ban in Brazil of the social media platform X, which is owned by sometime Trump ally Elon Musk, that lasted for more than a month last year after Musk and X refused to appoint a legal representative for their business in the country or to comply with court orders and requests to remove certain accounts and posts associated with election misinformation.",
      "And Trump\u2019s own social media company, Trump Media, has sued de Moraes over a suspension order he issued to the video hosting company Rumble, which Trump Media uses for its Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cThe way that Brazil has treated former President Bolsonaro, a Highly Respected Leader throughout the World during his Term, including by the United States, is an international disgrace. This Trial should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d Trump said in a letter that he sent to Brazil\u2019s president, who is widely known as Lula, and posted to Truth Social on July 9.",
      "Trump\u2019s letter went on to tie Bolsonaro\u2019s prosecution and de Moraes\u2019 social media rulings to the tariffs he\u2019d later impose: \u201cDue in part to Brazil\u2019s insidious attacks on Free Elections, and the fundamental Free Speech Rights of Americans (as lately illustrated by the Brazilian Supreme Court, which has issued hundreds of SECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders to U.S. Social Media platforms, threatening them with Millions of Dollars in Fines and Eviction from the Brazilian Social Media market), starting on August 1, 2025, we will charge Brazil a Tariff of 50% on any and all Brazilian products sent into the United States.\u201d",
      "Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy, exports popular commodities like coffee, beef, oranges, aircraft, oil, iron and steel to the U.S. Trump\u2019s executive order excluded some products, including oranges, oil and fertilizers, but not coffee or beef.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions against Brazil have brought the country\u2019s opposing political sides together to some extent.",
      "A delegation including Bolsonaro supporters and a former opposition Cabinet member from Brazil\u2019s foreign relations and defense committee met in Washington this week with Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Republican Sen. Thom Tillis to try to iron out the dispute.",
      "Brazil\u2019s foreign minister also flew to Washington to meet with Rubio on Wednesday. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick talked by phone with his Brazilian counterpart, two of the Brazilian officials told NBC News. They also said the call did not go well.",
      "Lula has not yet announced whether or how Brazil will retaliate against the U.S. tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, a U.S. appeals court panel heard arguments on a challenge to Trump\u2019s authority to impose tariffs by executive order brought by businesses and a coalition of state attorneys general. Tariff opponents argue the White House has not established that a national emergency exists to justify Trump\u2019s circumventing what is, with some emergency exceptions, supposed to be congressional authority over tariffs.",
      "Several of the judges on the panel pressed the Justice Department lawyer representing the government on the president\u2019s right to impose steep duties using an economic emergency law that does not specifically mention tariffs. No other president has ever tried to impose tariffs under the 1977 law the Trump administration is citing. The case is expected to eventually end up at the Supreme Court."

      "On Thursday, Yu Zidi became the youngest-ever medalist at the World Aquatics Championships, which are being held in Singapore this year.",
      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",
      "Yu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, could earn an individual medal on Sunday in the women\u2019s 400-meter medley. Her times are so fast that they allowed her to compete at the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.",
      "She has already come close to medaling in two other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter medley on Monday and 0.31 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter butterfly on Thursday.",
      "At the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.",
      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Katie Ledecky of the United States and Summer McIntosh of Canada, with times that would have put her on the verge of medaling at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Already, Yu is swimming the 400-meter individual medley about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",
      "But sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.",
      "\u201cI never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,\u201d he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him \u201csevere\u201d mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.",

      "Katie Ledecky stubbornly refused to give up her 800-meter freestyle crown Saturday at the world championships in Singapore, winning that race for a seventh consecutive time and fending off Canada's Summer McIntosh, who led a field of talented, young would-be usurpers.",
      "The seven world wins put Ledecky at the top of the chart for the most triumphs in a single event, as she passed her own record of six victories in the 1500 free and Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m of Sweden's six titles in the 50 butterfly.",
      "Ledecky said she didn't feel too much pressure coming into this race, satisfied with how she's been training all year.",
      "\"It's been a really great season and I think coming into tonight, no matter what the outcome was, I was gonna be really happy with my season,\" she told NBC Sports. \"And I think I just took the pressure off and allowed me to enjoy the race and kind of appreciate that moment.\"",
      "Ledecky forced the early pace, with McIntosh keeping her in close range.",
      "The young Canadian then took a brief, 0.14-second lead after 700 meters, with Ledecky's dominance appearing to teeter.",
      "But the veteran found another gear and quickly regained the lead before heading into the final 50 with a 0.25-second edge over McIntosh, an advantage the American extended as she closed out another win.",
      "McIntosh fell to third behind Australia's Lani Pallister.",
      "\u201cThat last 100 was pretty stressful,\u201d Ledecky said. \u201cLani was and Summer was right there.\u201d",
      "Ledecky clocked in at 8:05.62, Pallister at 8:05.98 and McIntosh 8:07.29. It was by far the closest worlds win of Ledecky's seven in the 800 free.",
      "A disappointed McIntosh said she didn\u2019t swim as well as she wanted to, but will turn the page and concentrate on her next race, in the 400 individual medley.",
      "\"So it's just the beginning and I know I have lots of time in my career to do better at it,\" she told the CBC.",
      "McIntosh vowed to use Saturday's disappointment as fuel for future 800-meter efforts.",
      "\"I really wanted to swim my own race and I didn't do that,\" said McIntosh, who congratulated Ledecky and called her an \u201cinspiration of mine.\u201d",
      "\"I think what I did tonight actually makes me want to keep doing it more, to see how much better I can get at it because I know I can be way faster than I was tonight.\"",
      "The suburban Washington, D.C., native Ledecky said she's now looking forward to some time off, time with loved ones and a few dips in the pool she swam in as a youngster.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to that,\" she said. \"It's home to me but I'm with the people that I love, around the pool.\"",
      "The niece of New York Islanders co-owner Jon Ledecky has also been dominating the 800 free at the Olympics, having won gold in this race at the 2012 Games in London, 2016 in Rio, 2021 in Tokyo and last summer near Paris.",
      "She\u2019s the only woman to win the same individual event at four Olympics, in any sport. The only other swimmer to pull off such a four-peat was American legend Michael Phelps, who took the 200 individual medley in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016.",
      "At age 28, Ledecky was the field's oldest swimmer, and she outdueled her youngest and most fierce competitor, the 18-year-old Toronto native McIntosh.",
      "Ledecky\u2019s air of 800 invincibility was dented last year when a 17-year-old McIntosh beat the American at the Southern Zone South Sectional Championships in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 8.",
      "The Canadian prodigy opted against swimming in the 800 in France to concentrate on other events. She took gold in the 200 butterfly, 200 individual medley and 400 individual medley to become one of the breakout stars of last summer.",
      "If McIntosh takes on the 800 free in Los Angeles, Saturday\u2019s race offered a tantalizing preview of what could be in store for 2028."

    "story": [
      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Former Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe was sentenced Friday to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery in a historic case that gripped the South American nation and tarnished the conservative strongman\u2019s legacy.",
      "The sentence, which Uribe said will be appealed, followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that he attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cPolitics prevailed over the law in sentencing,\u201d Uribe said after Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Uribe, 73, has denied any wrongdoing. He faced up to 12 years in prison after being convicted Monday.",
      "His attorney had asked the court to allow Uribe to remain free while he appeals the verdict. Judge Sandra Heredia on Friday said she did not grant the defense\u2019s request because it would be \u201ceasy\u201d for the former president to leave the country to \u201cevade the imposed sanction.\u201d",
      "Heredia also banned Uribe from holding public office for eight years and fined him about $776,000.",
      "Ahead of Friday\u2019s sentencing, Uribe posted on X that he was preparing arguments to support his appeal. He added that one must \u201cthink much more about the solution than the problem\u201d during personal crises.",
      "The appeals court will have until early October to issue a ruling, which either party could then challenge before Colombia\u2019s Supreme Court.",
      "The former president governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States. He is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.",
      "Heredia on Monday said she had seen enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former paramilitary group members, who were in prison, into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a leftist senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "Uribe in 2012 filed a libel suit against Cepeda in the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court in 2018 dismissed the accusations against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe.",
      "Martha Pe\u00f1uela Rosales, a supporter of Uribe\u2019s party in the capital, Bogota, said she wept and prayed after hearing of the sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an unjust sentence. He deserves to be free,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Sergio Andr\u00e9s Parra, who protested against Uribe outside the courthouse, said the 12-year sentence \u201cis enough\u201d and, even if the former president appeals, \u201chistory has already condemned him.\u201d",
      "During Uribe\u2019s presidency, Colombia\u2019s military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America\u2019s oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group\u2019s leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016."

      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",
      "The beloved feline was killed in late June but his death only began to garner international attention in the last week.",

      "Africa Geographic\u2019s CEO, Simon Epsley, said the organization was \u201cdismayed and angered\u201d at the killing.",
      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",
      "Born Free, another U.K.-based advocacy group, has expressed concern for Blondie\u2019s pride, saying the fate of its three female partners and a number of cubs was \u201cseriously in doubt.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",
      "After the worldwide outrage caused by Cecil\u2019s killing, Zimbabwean authorities vowed to crack down on trophy hunting  \u2014 but pressure groups say it hasn\u2019t worked.",
      "Mark Jones, Born Free\u2019s head of policy, said that that little has been learned since Cecil\u2019s death.",

    "story": [
      "As deaths from starvation in the Gaza Strip continue to rise, experts say there\u2019s no easy way out of the crisis due to the medical complexity of treating severe malnutrition.",
      "More than 160 people \u2014 at least 90 of them children \u2014 have died of malnutrition since the war began, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "The world\u2019s leading body on hunger, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), says that nearly all of Gaza is suffering a food security crisis or worse, and more than half of the population is in the \u201cemergency\u201d or \u201ccatastrophe\u201d phase of starvation \u2014 which means recovering isn\u2019t as simple as giving starving people food.",
      "Rather, giving food to people experiencing such an extreme degree of starvation could kill them, experts say.",
      "\u201cIf you do what the body wants to do, which is to just drink and eat as much as possible the minute you see food, you can actually create these permanent imbalances that can cause things like heart failure or organ damage, because the body had to adapt to get to that starvation mode,\u201d NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel, an internal medicine doctor, said.",
      "At the most severe stages of starvation, even giving a person water can push their body into failure, Patel said.",
      "What happens to the body when it\u2019s starving?",
      "Humans can generally go without any food or water for several days because the body finds a way to adapt in order to survive. First by feeding off of so-called glycogen stores \u2014 a starchy substance from carbohydrates that\u2019s stored in the liver and muscles. The body stores about 1,700 to 2,200 calories\u2019 worth of energy as glycogen.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing your body goes for that can get you through without eating or any water for about several days, in some cases, maybe a little longer,\u201d Patel said.",
      "Once those glycogen stores are depleted, the body starts to break down fat for energy, but when that\u2019s gone, it turns to muscle. This is what causes the body to shrink and the starving person to assume a gaunt, hollow-cheeked look.Eventually the brain doesn\u2019t have the energy it needs to function, leading to irritability, mood swings and trouble concentrating.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to even just make sound judgments,\u201d Patel said. \u201cYou can see people have psychotic illusions. You can see people hearing things. All of that is basically the body\u2019s way of surviving.\u201d",
      "Most starving people die from infections as their immune system shuts down. Eventually, the heart will be affected, causing a person\u2019s blood pressure and pulse to drop. If they don\u2019t die from infection, the heart will shut down, doctors said.",
      "The more vulnerable parts of the population are likely to suffer the most. \u201cChildren \u2014 specifically infants \u2014 pregnant women, the elderly and people with certain kinds of chronic illness are the risk groups that we need to pay special attention to,\u201d said Dr. Irwin Redlener, a clinical professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.",
      "How is starvation treated?",
      "Patel said a good analogy to giving food to a starving person is a downpour after a drought. The land desperately needs water, but because it\u2019s so dry it repels water instead of absorbing it, leading to flash flooding. \u201cRefeeding\u201d after starvation needs to be managed clinically and by medical professionals.",
      "\u201cWhen a person has reached a state of starvation, the body undergoes extreme metabolic changes,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving too much food \u2014 or the wrong kind \u2014 too quickly can trigger a dangerous shift in fluids and electrolytes known as refeeding syndrome, which can be fatal if not carefully managed.\u201d",
      "\u201cA bag of flour \u2014 some of the only food aid that has gotten in recently \u2014 won\u2019t save anyone because it has none of the essential nutrients,\u201d said Dr. Nour Alamassi, a doctor and the medical team lead for Project HOPE, an international nongovernmental organization focused on global health and humanitarian aid.",
      "\u201cToo many carbs can actually be life-threatening for anyone with Severe Acute Malnourishment (SAM), and even for the average person in Gaza who has not had a regular diet in many months, it is very difficult to digest,\u201d Alamassi, who is caring for children and pregnant women in Gaza, wrote in an email.",
      "Ideally, doctors told NBC News, there would be enough medical staff to monitor the refeeding process for each person for a period stretching from weeks to even months. Children would be stabilized with fortified milks, which contain the nutrients that a malnourished child needs, and something called ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF), which are energy-dense, easy to digest and carefully balanced in the nutrients children need to start to recover. Doctors would draw blood to monitor sodium and potassium levels \u2014 if these electrolytes are too low or too high, it can be deadly.",
      "But the situation on the ground in Gaza is far from ideal. There are not enough doctors, not enough supplies and not the right supplies, experts say.",
      "\u201cThe aid blockade has prevented us from accessing the medications and nutrition supplies that are necessary to treat these people,\u201d Alamassi said. \u201cWe recently ran out of High Energy Biscuits (HEB) in our clinics, which really limits our ability to help patients. We hope to get more in the coming days, but each day without these supplies can make a major difference for a patient\u2019s outcome.\u201d",
      "What are the long-term effects of starvation?",
      "Even if refeeding is successful, people who survive starvation can experience physical and psychological effects for the rest of their lives, experts said. The damage, especially for young and very old victims, is permanent.",
      "In children, malnutrition can cause delays in both physical and cognitive development. Physically, they\u2019re more likely to have weakened immune systems, leading to a harder time recovering from infections. Malnourished children are also more likely to experience stunted growth, which can affect their height, muscle mass and bone density and even delay puberty, experts said.",
      "Cognitively, children can suffer from permanent brain damage due to iron and zinc deficiencies, affecting their ability to learn and problem solve.",
      "Alamassi said the hunger crisis in Gaza is affecting \u201can entire generation of children who will suffer lifelong consequences.\u201dThe recovery of adults from very severe malnutrition is not only possible, but likely, Redlener said.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s done right, most adults, unless they\u2019re really at a terminal stage of undernutrition, the refeeding will result in restoration of everything \u2014 a far different story than the ability for a young child with prolonged malnutrition, where it\u2019s often impossible to get a full recovery,\u201d he said.",
      "Patel said even people with a history of malnutrition are monitored over years to make sure their bodies are functioning properly.",
      "\u201cAs they age and develop, different parts of the body pull on memories of that nutrition depletion,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question we all have to ask ourselves is, how long are we going to be able to do this without having adequate support on the ground?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, made an extremely rare visit to Gaza on Friday amid the spiraling hunger crisis in the enclave under Israel's deadly offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "The pair visited an aid distribution site in Rafah run by the controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has for months overseen the majority of aid distribution in the enclave under a new system launched in May.",
      "\"Today, we spent over five hours inside Gaza,\" Witkoff said in a post on X. He said they spent that time \"level setting the facts on the ground, assessing conditions,\" and meeting with GHF and other agencies.",
      "\"The purpose of the visit was to give @POTUS a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid to the people of Gaza,\" he said.",
      "Huckabee said in a separate post that he had joined Witkoff on the visit to \"learn the truth\" about aid sites run by GHF. He said they also received briefings from the Israeli military and \"spoke to folks on the ground.\" It was not immediately clear whom he was referring to.",

      "Israel on Sunday announced measures to allow more aid into Gaza amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths from starvation. Since then, GHF has continued to distribute about 1.2 million meals a day, according to data shared by the organization. In a population of roughly 2.1 million people, that equates to just over half a meal per person per day on average.",
      "Humanitarian groups have said the aid that has so far been allowed into Gaza over the past week is not enough to stave off famine in the enclave.",
      "They have also condemned incidents in which hundreds of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach aid in the weeks since the new distribution system came into effect.",
      "Since late May, more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food, with 859 deaths \"in the vicinity\" of GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys,\" the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, said in a news release Thursday. It said most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.",
      "Witkoff and Huckabee made the trip as part of an effort by Washington to secure a plan to see more food delivered to Gaza as deaths from starvation in the enclave continue to rise, according to the White House.",
      "It was not clear how arrangements for the visit, including the meetings with local Palestinians in Gaza, were being arranged, with Israel having maintained strict control over access to Gaza throughout the war, barring international media and foreign officials from entering the territory independently.",
      "Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, condemned the visit, writing in a statement addressed to Witkoff: \"Gaza is not Animal Farm that needs a theatrical personal visit to take some pictures in front of the #Death_Factories that your American companies manage in collaboration with the fascist army of Israel.\"",
      "The trip comes as a growing number of Palestinians continue to die from starvation despite months of warnings from humanitarian groups about the impact of Israel\u2019s offensive and the strict aid restrictions it has upheld.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff and Huckabee would brief Trump \"immediately after their visit to approve a final plan for food and aid distribution into the region.\"",
      "She said more details would be forthcoming once the plan was \"approved and agreed on by the president of the United States.\"",
      "Their visit to Gaza comes after Witkoff traveled to Israel and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday to address the dire humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Trump said earlier this week that \"real starvation\" was taking place, citing images he had seen on TV in a break with Netanyahu, who has denied there is starvation in the enclave and sought to blame Hamas for the crisis."
