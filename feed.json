      "An artist in Denmark is seeking to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that includes three piglets starving to death",
      "An artist in Denmark aims to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that opened Friday that includes three piglets who will be denied food and water and will starve to death.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",
      "It's not Evaristti's first controversial project.",
      "One of his projects included goldfish in blenders, tempting viewers to press the button and create goldfish soup.",
      "In 2006 he used some of his own body fat removed via liposuction to prepare meatballs, and then ate some of them.",
      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

      "Hackman's performance as an obsessed and amoral cop in the 1971 film \u201cThe French Connection\" earned an Oscar for best actor in a leading role and was considered one of his defining roles. Hackman swung another Oscar for playing a sadistic sheriff in 1992's \u201cUnforgiven.\"",
      "Hackman demurred from the pomp of celebrity and was considered an actor's actor who focused on the job and not on his image, dodging social circuit appearances beyond some award ceremonies.",

      "Murray worked with Hackman on director Wes Anderson\u2019s 2001 film \u201cThe Royal Tennenbaums.\u201d Hackman gave young directors such as Anderson a hard time but brought skill to the set, Murray said.",
      "\u201cI watched him once do, like, 25 takes where he did it perfectly with an actor who kept blowing it every single time,\u201d Murray told The Associated Press. \u201cHe was a great one. He was a great actor.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children\u2019s television program",
      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, creator Tommy Krappweis drew Bernd's infamous grimace after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster's face when they were asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",
      "The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer \u2014 and an involuntary trendsetter.",

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Opera is staging a production of Herman Melville's masterpiece about a white whale, \u2018Moby-Dick",
      "When Leonard Foglia was invited to direct an opera based on Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece about a white whale, his first reaction was: \u201cMoby-Dick. That\u2019s great!\u201d",
      "\u201cThen I ran to a used bookstore and got the book,\u201d he recalled, \u201cand I thought: \u2018Oh my God, what am I in for here?\u2019 It\u2019s so daunting. I didn\u2019t panic, but I thought, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019\u201d",
      "How he and his collaborators did it will be on display at the Metropolitan Opera beginning March 3. The opera is composed by Jake Heggie to a libretto crafted by Gene Scheer.",
      "To begin with, Scheer had to whittle a novel of more than 600 pages down to a 64-page libretto. He kept as much of Melville\u2019s language as possible, and estimates that 40% to 50% of his libretto can be found in the original text, though he often tweaked the phrasing to make it more singable.",
      "Heggie and his initial partner, Terrence McNally (who withdrew for health reasons), had already decided to lop off the opening chapters, which take place on land. They set the entire opera aboard the whale-hunting ship Pequod.",
      "Another crucial change was renaming the narrator, calling him Greenhorn to reflect his status as a novice aboard the ship. Now the book\u2019s famous opening line, \u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d is transposed to the very end of the opera when the character has matured.",
      "\u201cIn the novel, Ishmael is telling a story that happened many years ago,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cBut in the theater, you want to see it happen in real time. \u2026 We\u2019re watching him take in all the experiences so that when he says \u2018Call me Ishmael,\u2019 he\u2019s ready to write the book. In essence, this opera is the education of Ishmael.\u201d",
      "Tenor Stephen Costello, who is performing the role for the fifth time and is the lone cast holdover from the Dallas premiere in 2010, sees his character as \u201cthe only one who really has an arc.",
      "\u201cHe goes on the Pequod because there was nothing for him on land,\u201d Costello said. \u201cSo he\u2019s either going to die at sea or figure out who he is.\u201d",
      "In addition to Costello, the Met cast includes tenor Brandon Jovanovich as the vengeance-obsessed Captain Ahab. Pip, his cabin boy, is written as a \u201ctrousers role\u201d (a male character portrayed by a woman) and will be sung by soprano Janai Brugger. Starbuck, the first mate, will be baritone Peter Mattei, and bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green will sing the part of Queequeg. Karen Kamensek conducts the eight performances through March 29.",
      "The opera, commissioned to celebrate the opening of a new opera house in Dallas, has been a success from the beginning, drawing praise from audiences and critics \u2014 and even scholars.",
      "Bob Wallace, a professor at Northern Kentucky University and past president of the Melville Society, admired the opera so much that he wrote a book about its creation.",
      "\u201cScheer and Heggie did a brilliant job of shrinking the novel to make it fit the stage and yet preserve so much of the essence of it,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "As much as critics admired Scheer\u2019s adaptation and Heggie\u2019s tuneful, atmospheric and at times gripping score, they lavished special praise on the physical production, with sets by Robert Brill and projections by Elaine J. McCarthy.",
      "The action, Steve Smith wrote in The New York Times, \u201cplayed out against a multimedia-enriched staging that ranged from striking to near-miraculous.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most stunning effect is the way animated projections superimposed on a climbing wall that is curved a bit like a skateboard ramp create the illusion of the crew leaving the Pequod to board three whaling boats.",
      "\u201cA lot of the excitement and thrill of watching this is due to the work of the production team,\u201d Scheer said. \u201cLenny kept saying to me, \u2019You imagine it the way you want it, and let me figure out how to do it.\u201d",
      "That often involved imposing unusual physical demands on the singers. For instance, when Pip gets lost at sea, his character sings the equivalent of an operatic mad scene dangling high above the stage, with projections making it appear he\u2019s treading water.",
      "\u201cI said to Janai when we first rehearsed it,\u201d Foglia recalled, \u201cOK, you can just get mad at me now, because you have to sing your hardest aria hanging from not even a full harness, just a single wire.\u201d",
      "In addition, Queequeg and Greenhorn climb up and down ladders to sing at the top of the mastheads. Ahab, who has lost a leg in a prior encounter with Moby-Dick, has to hobble on a wooden prosthesis. And Greenhorn \u2014 finally named Ishmael \u2014 ends the opera grabbing onto a whale hook from a passing ship that lifts him to safety.",
      "\u201cI joke with them that everything opera singers count on in life \u2014 having both feet planted on the ground \u2014 I\u2019ve taken away from them,\u201d Foglia said.",

      "\u201cWe have lost a true legend. The magnificent Gene Hackman has passed away. A man whose breath of talent was immeasurable. Growing up on his movies was an absolute thrill for me. To observe his remarkable facility and humanity in every role was something to behold. Whatever film he was in, he made it better. A force of nature like no other and as such there will never be another like him.\u201d \u2014 actor Cary Elwes.",
      "\u201cHe was a tough nut, Gene Hackman, but he was really good and he was really difficult. Like, we can say it now, but he was a tough guy because older, great actors do not give young directors much of a chance. They're really rough on \u2019em.\u201d \u2014 actor Bill Murray, recalling working with Hackman on \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\u201d with director Wes Anderson, in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe greatest ... \u201d \u2014 director Edgar Wright on X.",
      "\u201cSo awful. Gene was such an inspiration to so many of us who love movies. So many brilliant roles. His performance in \u2018The Conversation\u2019 alone changed the way I looked at acting and what actors could bring to a role. Such an amazing career. RIP Mr. Hackman.\u201d \u2014 director Paul Feig on X.",
      "\u201cLoved you in everything! \u2018The Conversation,\u2019 \u2018The French Connection,\u2019 \u2018The Poseidon Adventure,\u2019 \u2018Unforgiven\u2019 \u2014tough yet vulnerable. You were one of the greats. God bless those who loved you. Rest well, sir.\u201d \u2014 actor Viola Davis on Instagram.",
      "\"One of the best, one of the very, very best, has passed. Everything you ever wanted to know and learn about the craft of screen acting could be found in any, ANY of his performances. \u2018The French Connection.\u2019 \u2018Crimson Tide,\u2019 \u2018The Conversation.\u2019 Gosh! I could go on\u2026 A master. \u2014 actor Steve Toussaint on Instagram.",
      "\u201cI am crushed by the sudden deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa (and their dog). Crushed. He was always one of my favorites. Not many who beat to their own drums like he did. Rest in Peace.\u201d \u2014 actor Josh Brolin on Instagram.",
      "\u201cA very sad day for the cinema\u2019s family.\u201d \u2014 Antonio Banderas on X."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014  \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d is a hard act to follow.",
      "Last year\u2019s Oscars was by all accounts a successful show, with memorable performances and unscripted moments (thanks in part to Emma Stone\u2019s dress), and a winning movie that most people had seen. But the team behind last year\u2019s show is \u201caiming for the stars\u201d once more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling the pressure,\u201d said Oscars executive producer and showrunner Raj Kapoor. \u201cBut we\u2019re not ones to rest on our laurels. We always want to push the envelope.\u201d",
      "With just days to go until the three-and-a-half hour live broadcast, airing on ABC and streaming live on Hulu Sunday, March 2, the team behind the show gave The Associated Press a little insight into what to expect.",
      "\u201cWe want people when they watch the Oscars to be inspired by the films but also be inspired by the broadcast and feel something like it\u2019s a show that you can watch with your friends and your family and debate on who should have won and who is winning,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cWe want people to have all the feels when they watch the show.\u201d",
      "One of the major things that the producers are excited about this year is their first-time host, Conan O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cThat alone brings this fresh, invigorated energy,\u201d Kapoor said. O\u2019Brien, he said, has been a \u201cwealth of ideas and imagination\u201d since he accepted the gig and that he and his team are going to keep writing up until the show \u2014 and as a veteran of live television, he's skilled at in-the-moment improvisation as well.",
      "\u201cHe is going to be this great, exciting, warm hug and guide us through the night,\u201d said Oscars executive producer Katy Mullan. \u201cHe\u2019s got some surprises up his sleeve, which is fantastic because we love to keep people guessing.\u201d",
      "The Oscars this year decided to nix performances of the original songs, but there will still be some big names gracing the stage including \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo \u2014 though they\u2019re staying mum on whether any gravity will be defied in that performance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking for months,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a moment that\u2019s been very special.\u201d",
      "Lisa of Blackpink and Doja Cat will also be part of the broadcast, and the producers promised a musical moment that will honor Los Angeles and filmmaking in Hollywood.",
      "The wildfires, Mullan said, will be acknowledged in the show.",
      "\u201cThe Grammys did an incredible job with their show and how it was treated,\u201d Mullan said. \u201cOur show being a month after that and Conan having been affected himself, we\u2019re just looking at the right way to calibrate it so that it feels like the right show for March 2 \u2014 that we do acknowledge it and reflect on it but also allow people the chance to step on that stage and have their moment and celebrate their talent.\"",
      "Last year the Oscars made a moment out of what is usually just a list of names by inviting past Oscar acting winners to speak about each of the nominees before the winner was read. This year it's back, but evolved. It won\u2019t be the actors this time, but some of the other categories that \u201cmaybe don\u2019t normally get the spotlight on the Oscar stage,\u201d Mullan said.",
      "She added: \u201cOur theme is all about collaboration and the alchemy of filmmaking and really taking a look behind the scenes and understanding a bit more of the interconnectedness of how a film comes together.\u201d",
      "First, Mullan said, it\u2019s only Wednesday \u2014 there\u2019s still time to catch the diverse group of 10 best picture nominees before Sunday if you really try. But don\u2019t fret if you\u2019ve only seen a few. The show could be a discovery event.",
      "\u201cIf you love the movies, like come to the Oscars and maybe you\u2019ll discover things that you actually have not seen yet but will want to,\u201d Kapoor said. \u201cHopefully you\u2019ll fall in love even with a few pictures while watching the show.\u201d",
      "Also? It's just full of major stars.",

      "New York musician Larry Saltzman isn't really a movie fan, but he'll be sure to watch the Oscars this year",
      "NEW YORK -- He's not a movie buff, so New York musician Larry Saltzman doesn't always watch the Oscars. This year, however, he's got a rooting interest.",
      "Saltzman taught actor Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet how to play guitar for the role of Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d In turn, Chalamet earned a best actor nomination and the film is also up for best picture at the Academy Awards on Sunday.",
      "A guitarist who's performed with Simon & Garfunkel, Bette Midler and David Johansen, as well as in the pit at Broadway productions \u201cHairspray\u201d and \u201cAin't Too Proud to Beg,\u201d Saltzman has developed a specialty in teaching actors how to play music for their roles. Besides Chalamet, recent pupils have included Adam Driver and Sadie Sink of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d",
      "On a fellow musician's recommendation, Saltzman first got a call from a movie studio about a decade ago. He admits to being cranky as discussions dragged on. \u201cI almost did everything to talk them out of hiring me,\u201d he said.",
      "Not until the fifth phone call did the studio identify the client: Meryl Streep.",
      "She needed to learn the electric guitar for her starring role in the 2015 film \u201cRicki and the Flash,\u201d where she portrayed an aging rocker trying to keep her career and life together in the wake of a series of disappointments.",
      "Working with Streep is a little like a political consultant's first client being elected president. If she likes you and word gets around, other students will follow. Teaching actors now represents about 40% of his business, the 69-year-old said.",
      "\u201cMy time spent with her was excellent,\u201d he said of Streep. \u201cShe's smart. She knows how to learn things. There was a steady progress over three or four months. She did very well.\u201d",
      "Faking it just won't do for serious actors and film directors. It's like lip-syncing \u2014 the audience is going to tell the difference, and the characters will be less believable. That was especially true with Chalamet, who needed to sing and play at the same time for a character whose artistry is the centerpiece of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen the actors come to you, they're kind of vulnerable,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThey want to do a great job.\u201d",
      "Saltzman had more than 50 sessions with Chalamet, starting in person and retreating to Zoom during the pandemic. It wasn't easy. Chalamet had to learn some 25 songs in the script.",
      "\u201cSometime in 2018 I had my first lesson with this great guitar teacher named Larry Saltzman who at some point became less of a teacher and more a co-sanity artist through COVID,\u201d Chalamet recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI think we were keeping each other sane. We would Zoom three, four times a week and doing songs that never made it into the movie.\u201d",
      "It helped that Saltzman is a Dylan buff. Focusing on imparting \u201cthe guitar playing of \u2018pre-electric Bob,\u2019\u201d he taught his charge so well that Chalamet was a musical guest as well as host on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d performing obscure Dylan cuts last month. Saltzman says, in the course of their sessions, Chalamet \u201cwent the extra mile\u201d and unearthed \u201cvery early, obscure\u201d Dylan songs that weren't even in the script.",
      "Saltzman generally likes teaching actors more than common folk, in part because there's a specific goal: They need to learn certain songs to inhabit a particular character. When it's open-ended \u2014 someone just wants to learn the guitar \u2014 it can be more of a challenge, he said. Saltzman also believes that it's an advantage to not be a regular teacher, someone who may approach clients with a more rigid style.",
      "Actor Johnny Cannizzaro said he appreciated Saltzman's calming \u201cbedside manner\u201d and felt welcome in an apartment filled with guitars. Cannizzaro has the role of E Street Band member \u201cLittle Steven\u201d Van Zandt in the upcoming Bruce Springsteen biopic, \u201cDeliver Me From Nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was never really a moment where he expressed any sort of frustration or impatience with me during a session,\u201d said Cannizzaro, who has background playing keyboards but not guitar. \u201cIf anything, he would express some excitement when you grasped something he was teaching. That put me at ease.\u201d",
      "Saltzman also studied film of Van Zandt so he wasn't just teaching Cannizzaro guitar \u2014 he was showing specifics of how Van Zandt plays, the actor said.",
      "Beyond teaching, Saltzman's time is divided between studio work, playing in New York clubs accompanying different artists and Broadway \u2014 he's just about to begin \u201cSmash.\u201d",
      "It's an eye-opening experience for him to later see his students on screen. That was particularly the case when he saw \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and marveled at Chalamet's ability as an actor.",
      "All the more reason to watch the Oscars, and to take some pride in his own work.",
      "\u201cIn my own humble way, I'm a small gear in that machinery,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is rewarding is knowing that in some small way I'm contributing to making a better film.\u201d",

      "A new album documents jazz legend Ella Fitzgerald in concert in Oakland, California, in 1967",
      "The setting is less grand than suggested by the title of a new Ella Fitzgerald album, \u201cThe Moment of Truth: Ella at the Coliseum.\u201d In this case, the coliseum is not in Rome or Los Angeles, but the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California.",
      "Jazz giant Fitzgerald\u2019s presence elevated any event, however, and that was the case on June 30, 1967, when she performed at a concert that also included The Duke Ellington Orchestra and other luminaries.",
      "\u201cThe Moment of Truth\u201d documents Fitzgerald\u2019s set, and her incomparable alto is in typically fine form. She bounces and glides, blares and coos, bellows and whoops and scats and swings to the audience\u2019s delight. \u201cIf you love her, clap!\u201d someone shouts.",
      "The album, which will be released Friday, features performances of nine songs unearthed from the private tape collection of Verve Records founder Norman Granz. The vinyl release offers outstanding sound quality and extensive, informative liner notes by the critic Will Friedwald. He notes that while it was unusual for Fitzgerald to sing contemporary pop tunes, the set includes her only known performance of two classics from the mid-1960s \u2014 the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned \"Alfie\u201d and Bob Crewe's \u201cMusic to Watch Girls By.\u201d",
      "Fitzgerald is accompanied by a piano trio, and on several songs by the Ellington orchestra, with whom she had a lengthy 1960s collaboration. Ellington doesn\u2019t play, however, and the understated arrangements leave the spotlight entirely to Fitzgerald. She\u2019s in a playful mood in her on stage banter, teasing a late arrival, impersonating Louis Armstrong, and ruling out a striptease.",
      "Her singing is radiant as she turns sophisticated melodies into a thrill ride. Their direction is as unpredictable as a pinball, with rhythmic daring and inventiveness that could make an arena sway. And it probably did.",
      "Fitzgerald flies high on \u201cMack the Knife,\u201d and displays jazzy verve on Benny Goodman\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be That Way\u201d and the Tony Bennett staple \u201cThe Moment of Truth,\u201d while \u201cYou\u2019ve Changed\u201d shimmers with bluesy beauty. On \u201cLet\u2019s Do It (Let\u2019s Fall in Love),\u201d her phrasing is as clever as Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics. In her version, she injects references to the Beatles,James Bond, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "As Friedwald notes, Fitzgerald rarely drew from the Burt Bacharach-Hal David catalogue. But her interpretation of their classic ballad \u201cAlfie\u201d is a marvel of technique, emotional investment and creativity, including a brief digression. Fitzgerald navigates the complicated melody and rhythm with ease. It's an exemplar of the album, because as always, in keeping with the advice of the lyrics, her heart leads the way.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian author Marcelo Rubens Paiva happily swung his wheelchair from side to side, dancing with thousands of Carnival revelers there to celebrate him and his work. Seconds later, an unidentified man showed Paiva his middle finger, then threw a beer can and a backpack that hit him in the head.",
      "Paiva, a popular author in Brazil for four decades, has had intense days and exchanges since the movie based on his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d became a box-office success. The film, a rare blockbuster in the South American nation, garnered three Oscar nominations ahead of the awards ceremony Sunday.",
      "While millions of Brazilians love the story for its long-overdue truth-telling about the country\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, others see it as left-wing propaganda. Paiva has been dismayed at the outpouring of hatred, mostly online, directed at him.",
      "\u201cIt is simply (our) history being told in the way we believe it must be told, the way our family lived it, so it never happens again,\u201d Paiva, 65, told The Associated Press in his Sao Paulo apartment. \u201cI assure you that some of those on the far-right or on the right have watched it and maybe changed their opinion.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is up for best picture and best international feature, while Fernanda Torres, who portrayed Paiva's mother Eunice, is competing for best actress. The film centers on the disappearance of Rubens Paiva, the author's father, and Eunice's decadeslong quest to force authorities to confirm his death.",
      "Paiva, one of five siblings, has known success, but not as much controversy. His 1982 book \u201cHappy Old Year\u201d narrating his life before and after a diving accident put him in a wheelchair, sold more than 1.5 million copies. He is also an award-winning playwright, former TV talk show host and political activist.",
      "But he says nothing prepared him for the sudden impact \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d had since it won best screenplay at the Venice Film Festival. Many other awards followed since.",
      "\u201cThis is very different; it is more intense because of social networks,\" Paiva said. \u201cPeople (around the world) react in the same way to this movie, with the same emotion that Brazilians felt.\u201d",
      "After his book about his accident, he knew he still had another important story to tell.",
      "\u201cI was the son of a disappeared politician; few people knew what had happened during the dictatorship,\u201d he said.",
      "That was largely because Congress passed an amnesty law in 1979, as the dictatorship neared its end, sparing perpetrators of political crimes from prosecution.",
      "Cracks started to emerge in 2011 after then President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses. It was one of the seeds for Paiva's book and, later, the film.",
      "\u201cPeople were asking for reparations for families of missing politicians, they sued my father\u2019s torturers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military showed they were upset, because their colleagues and their fellow coup mongers were under fire. The accusations were being published, so they started to threaten Brazil\u2019s democracy. And little by little it was once again in doubt.\u201d",
      "Past ire toward the Paiva family has notably come from one man: Jair Bolsonaro, the former army captain who rode a wave of anti-establishment populism to his presidency (2019-2022).",
      "In 2014, then-lawmaker Bolsonaro spat on a statue of the late Paiva in Congress, accusing him and his family of being at the service of communist terrorists. His claims date to the 1990s and falsely link a farm the Paiva family owned, near where Bolsonaro grew up, to a guerrilla group.",
      "\u201cEvery year, he made a speech against my father, making up stories,\u201d Paiva said. \u201cOnce, he said my father had been killed by his comrades who were in the armed struggle, because he had revealed things during the torture sessions. It was the first time I heard anyone tell such an absurd story, with no evidence, and people believed it. It was the first time I saw the power of social media in creating a new narrative, a lie.\"",
      "Bolsonaro said in an interview Monday he hasn't seen the film, but his allies have railed against it, saying Paiva died in a war, as did many on both sides. Brazil\u2019s Truth Commission found that at least 434 people died at the hands of the military regime, including 136 who disappeared.",
      "Paiva published \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d as Alzheimer\u2019s disease washed away his mother\u2019s memory. Director Walter Salles bought the rights in 2017, but chose not to make the film during Bolsonaro's presidency. Last week, Brazil's prosecutor-general indicted Bolsonaro for allegedly staging a coup to remain in power. It included inciting a riot in capital Brasilia by encouraging his supporters to riot marking an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cPeople everywhere are afraid of watching their democracies become dictatorships,\" Paiva said. \"This movie glorifies democracy and the understanding that human rights, empathy are in short supply.\u201d",
      "Adding to Paiva's recent achievements since the film premiered, his father\u2019s death certificate, first obtained by his mother in 1996, was updated in January to go beyond mere confirmation to include: \u201cviolent death caused by the Brazilian State in the context of systematic persecution to the population identified as dissidents of the policies of the dictatorial regime installed in 1964.\u201d",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court said earlier this week it will rule whether the sole survivor among Rubens Paiva\u2019s torturers, Gen. Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Nogueira Belham, can be tried. Brazilian human rights activists have argued that concealing bodies is a continuous crime not covered by the country\u2019s amnesty law.",
      "\u201cI see literature as a mission, and I feel mine was accomplished,\" said Paiva. \u201cThe movie\u2019s mission is accomplished, even if it doesn\u2019t win any Oscars.\u201d",

      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d",
      "A routine deep-sea diving mission in the North Sea goes terribly wrong when a young diver is stranded some 300 feet below the surface in the new film \u201cLast Breath.\u201d His umbilical cable has severed. The support vessel above is aimlessly drifting away from the site through violent, stormy waters. And the diver has only ten minutes of oxygen in his backup tank.",
      "As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s also a true story.",
      "If merely reading this is giving you heart palpitations already, you can only imagine the white-knuckle experience of watching this all play out on the big screen. It\u2019s 40ish minutes of pure suspense and anxiety as the story shuffles between the man at the bottom of the ocean, Chris Lemons (Finn Cole), his fellow saturation divers (Woody Harrelson as Duncan and Simu Liu as Dave) in the diving bell below the waters who are unable to help and the crew in the support vessel above (including Cliff Curtis and Mark Bonnar) scrambling to get their systems back online and operational as the clock rapidly runs out. Ten minutes has never felt so short \u2014 and then it just gets worse as the clock starts counting up, showing Chris\u2019s time without oxygen.",
      "At one point, Liu\u2019s character Dave, a no-nonsense, all-business diver says matter-of-factly at that it\u2019s a body recovery, not a rescue. Deep-sea saturation diving is a dangerous business, described at the start of the film as the most dangerous job on earth. Chris tells his fianc\u00e9, in a short introduction, that it\u2019s no more dangerous than going to space. She replies that it\u2019s funny that he thinks that is comforting.",
      "The real incident happened in September 2012 \u2014 Dave, Duncan and Chris were just one team of divers sent to the ocean floor off the coast of Aberdeen, Scotland, to repair oil pipeline.",
      "The seas were particularly rough that day, with winds up to 35 knots, common for the North Sea but also not what one might call safe. Chris and Dave were in the middle of their work when they heard the urgent calls to abort: The dynamic positioning system in the support vessel above had failed and they were in drift. Chris scrambled to maneuver out of the pipeline corridors, but his umbilical got caught. For a brief, awful moment he\u2019s the anchor to the ship above, but soon enough the cord snapped, and he was thrown back to the ocean floor in pitch black with no coms, no heat and very little hope for survival. News articles about the incident clock his backup oxygen supply as being closer to five or six minutes \u2013 perhaps the movie wanted to give the audience a little buffer.",
      "If this sounds at all familiar, it may be because it was made into a documentary, also called \u201cLast Breath\u201d and released in 2019. While it was well-received, some true stories are just too gripping to exist solely in that form. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that a narrative film was made as well. There\u2019s a good track record of recent complimentary adaptations \u2014 think Ron Howard\u2019s \u201c13 Lives\u201d and \u201cThe Rescue\u201d about the Thai boys soccer team stuck in the cave.",
      "This one was made by Alex Parkinson, the same director who co-directed the doc, and it\u2019s a well-executed narrative interpretation that doesn\u2019t get in its own way with padding. Harrelson gets to be the wise mentor who really doesn\u2019t want to lose someone on his last mission. Liu gets to flex his action muscles (literally and figuratively) in a modest but solid role. And they don't go out of their way to shoehorn in a villain \u2014 this is just a group of people trying their best to save a life.",
      "The only real problem, if one can even call it that, is that it\u2019s so short. The film doesn\u2019t take liberties with stretching out the timeline much at all and after 93 minutes, the whole thing is over. It feels strange to want a movie to be longer, but in the case of \u201cLast Breath\u201d I was both desperate for it to end, for anxiety reasons, and also wanting more.",
      "\u201cLast Breath,\u201d a Focus Features release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 Motion Picture Association for \u201cbrief strong language.\u201d Running time: 93 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "Often when Robert Pattinson gets a script, one of the first things he does is try on different accents to bring his character to life",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when Robert Pattinson gets a script, one of the first things he does \u2014 to the annoyance of his girlfriend, Suki Waterhouse \u2014 is try on different voices to bring his character to life.",
      "\"I\u2019ve always had that sort of response to a script,\u201d he reflected, but said it became a practice while making his 2014 film, \u201cThe Rover.\u201d \u201cI think I feel very uncomfortable just doing something in my own accent. And for a while I felt like just doing an American accent felt like I was acting more.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unsurprising, then, that when he was offered a starring role in \u201cMickey 17\u201d \u2014 director Bong Joon Ho\u2019s first feature film since his Oscar-winning \u201cParasite\u201d \u2014 Pattinson\u2019s wheels immediately began turning over what his character(s) would sound like.",
      "\u201cMickey 17,\u201d a Warner Bros. release hitting theaters March 7, tells the story of Mickey Barnes, a naive but sympathetic protagonist who signs up to be an \u201cexpendable\u201d in a world that makes use of \u201chuman printing\u201d for dangerous tasks and research. When an expendable dies on the job, another version of them is printed with their consciousness and memories of their death intact.",
      "But Mickey\u2019s immortality is threatened when a very different version of him is printed while the 17th Mickey is mistakenly believed to be dead.",
      "\u201cI needed to find an actor who could cover both personalities,\u201d Bong said through a translator, recalling Pattinson\u2019s performances in \u201cThe Lighthouse\u201d and \u201cGood Time\u201d as he considered the more sinister and conniving Mickey 18.",
      "The film is based on Edward Ashton's 2022 novel, \u201cMickey7.\u201d But Pattinson, who read the book before he got the script, said he still can\u2019t believe how different they are from one another. \u201cWhen I read the script and Bong\u2019s changes to it, I was like, \u2018How did you see this tone in this book at all?\u2019 It\u2019s very, very different tonally. But I thought it\u2019s fascinating to have that interpretation,\u201d he said.",
      "Although Pattinson was eager to work with the acclaimed Korean filmmaker, he wasn\u2019t given a lot of initial information about the movie or role. \u201cThe only thing I knew was that it was in English and that the part was impossible,\u201d Pattinson said, laughing.",
      "As he eventually gleaned more about the story and his character, ideas for Mickey \u2014 and Mickey\u2019s voices \u2014 began swirling around in his head.",
      "Pattinson envisioned slapstick montages of his myriad deaths \u00e0 la \u201cThe Tom and Jerry Show\u201d \u2014 but that portion of the film turned out to be much darker than he expected. One early idea for voices that Bong shut down was inspired by Steve-O and Johnny Knoxville \u2014 Pattinson was a devout \u201cJackass\u201d fan growing up and even repped a \u201cJackass\u201d T-shirt to school \u201calmost every day.\u201d",
      "But one initial idea the 38-year-old had did stick. \u201cMy first thought, on pretty much the first read of it, was, \u2018It\u2019s like Ren and Stimpy,\u2019\u201d he said of the irreverent animated Nickelodeon series from the 90's about a cat and dog.",
      "The dynamic between the two Mickeys is an apt comparison given Ren\u2019s short temper and diabolical nature (Mickey 18), which stands in stark contrast to Stimpy\u2019s naivete (Mickey 17). The similarities in their voices can also be heard.",
      "\u201cI kind of wanted to do this like cartoon character performance. You start out really, really extreme and then kind of gradually tone it down,\" he said of how he refined the characters. \u201cWhen directors just let you do stuff, you just come out of the box doing whatever and wherever your instinct is taking you.\"",
      "In addition to Pattison, the sci-fi comedy boasts an impressive cast, including Mark Ruffalo,Steven Yeun,Toni Collette and Naomi Ackie. Although Ackie, who plays Mickey\u2019s romantic partner in the film, hadn\u2019t worked with Pattinson before, she said they quickly hit it off.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re both quite similar in how we work, which is very chatty up until the point of \u2018Action,\u2019 and then we do the acting. And I really enjoy that kind of separation between character and self. I find it quite difficult to hold onto characters once there\u2019s no cameras on,\u201d she said.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just Pattinson who made the experience a positive one for her. \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain you could ask anyone who works with Bong Joon Ho, \u2018Would you go back?\u2019 And they\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019d pay money.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite the notoriety the director has reaped since \u201cParasite\u201d racked up four Oscars in 2020, including best picture and best director, Bong said the experience hasn't changed him.",
      "\u201cIt was fun and exciting to meet with all these famous artists and filmmakers during the campaign, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was like on cloud nine. It was actually very mentally and physically exhausting because the campaign is so long and I just remember thinking, \u2018Wow, this is really tough,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe kept just like handing each other vitamins.\u201d"

      "\u201cTo work in this difficult moment is really tough,\u201d Prada said backstage. Sidestepping overtly political discussion, she added: \u201dWhat we try to do are clothes that make sense for women today.\"",
      "Prada's Fall-Winter 2025-26 collection aimed to liberate women from strictly feminine forms. In that way the little black dress series and other runway looks were loosely constructed, not body-hugging.",

      "Five days before the Academy Awards, nearly every nominee gathered for a cocktail reception, dinner and class picture shoot that served as an Oscars orientation.",
      "The event Tuesday night at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures was a stand-in for the annual Oscars luncheon usually held about a month earlier but scrubbed because of the Southern California wildfires.",
      "With the voting over and winners determined, contenders got chummy and the mood was cheerful. Best actress favorites Mikey Madison and Demi Moore hugged and chatted. So did best actor front-runners Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Adrien Brody.",
      "\u201cEveryone say Oscar nominee!\u201d best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo shouted gleefully from the front row of the museum's David Geffen Theater, where the dozens of nominees sat for their group picture.",
      "Clustered in front with Erivo were three best supporting actress nominees: her \u201cWicked\u201d castmate Ariana Grande, Monica Barbaro of \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and Zoe Salda\u00f1a of \u201cEmilia Perez\" along with Madison, nominated for \u201cAnora.\u201d The five women stood in a circle and talked happily together after the photo, and kept the conversation going as they descended the stairs together to dinner.",
      "In the back of the theater, a trio of best actor nominees sat together: Sebastian Stan of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d Colman Domingo of \u201cSing Sing\u201d and Brody, of \u201cThe Brutalist.\"",
      "After the photo was taken, Academy President Janet Yang gave the orientation presentation, reminding everyone that the 97th Academy Awards will be held Sunday.",
      "She greeted first-time nominees and acknowledged there were also some with more than one.",
      "Denis Villeneuve, director of \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d and a four-time nominee, raised his hand. Sixteen-time best original song nominee Diane Warren raised both of hers.",
      "Yang emphasized that the wildfires made this year different, and emphasized \u201cthe importance of community and an atmosphere of support.\u201d",
      "But, she said, \"The show, the big show, the Oscar show, you know what I'm talking about, will of course go on, and we simply must honor the talent, your talents, this year, as we have every year.\"",
      "She gave the annual, usually fruitless, guidance that acceptance speeches should be limited to 45 seconds, and had the class repeat the number back to her. \u201cForty-five!\u201d they shouted.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't sound like a lot, but you can definitely get a lot in there,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat works best is to be heartfelt, humorous if you like, poignant, inspirational, but brief.\u201d",
      "A straggling nominee then showed up, and Grande shouted to the official photographer, \u201care you ready to go again, Trevor?\" and they reshot the picture.",
      "As the big group broke up, Chalamet greeted several reporters by name and hugged them.",
      "It was a fun night for the famous, but in some ways it's an even bigger evening, as Sunday will be, for the majority of nominees \u2014 from short film animators to sound mixers \u2014 who are neither famous faces nor household names.",
      "Here they were treated as equals with their A-list peers. All were identified by the same black name tags.",
      "Madison and Isabella Rossellini, up for best supporting actress for \u201cConclave,\u201d each wore theirs as they stood and talked at length during the cocktail reception. Many others dropped in on the conversation including Moore, \u201cAnora\u201d director Sean Baker, and best supporting actor nominee Jeremy Strong from \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d",
      "Rossellini and Madison pulled out their phones and shared dog photos.",
      "\u201cYes, you have like a farm!\u201d Strong said to Rossellini.",
      "Samantha Quan, a best picture nominee as an \u201cAnora\u201d producer and Baker's wife, asked Rossellini, \u201cDo you have any goats?\u201d",
      "\u201cOh yes,\u201d Rossellini replied.",
      "\"The Brutalist\u201d director Brady Corbet stopped to talk to the women too, but stood aside when they were asked to get closer for a photo.",
      "\u201cI don't want to get them sick,\u201d he said.",
      "The attire for the evening was listed as \u201ccocktail\u201d and the outfits ran the gamut. Madison, Grande and Moore wore evening gowns. Rossellini wore a smoking jacket and necktie with a gold brooch. Strong wore a brown bomber jacket with running shoes. Chalamet wore, if there is such a thing, a black, shiny, formal version of a denim jacket and jeans, with a blingy gold chain around his neck.",
      "Media members, publicists, partners and all others were eventually told to stand aside while the nominees sat for a dinner that was exclusive to them.",
      "The roll call that normally goes with the photo was skipped, so it was difficult to determine who wasn't there, but apparent absentees included Elton John, up for best original song, Ralph Fiennes, up for best actor for \u201cConclave,\u201d and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, nominated for best actress for \u201cEmilia Perez.\u201d"

This is something I am overwhelmed with gratitude to be a part of.\u201d",
      "Murakami, initially known for paintings and sculptures, saw his popularity explode when he paired with Louis Vuitton in 2002 for a line of bags featuring his artwork. The bags, which featured his iconic flower motifs and quirky characters in bright colors, quickly became some of the brand\u2019s most coveted items.",

Working with a Japanese artist of Takashi Murakami\u2019s caliber also allows us to celebrate Japan\u2019s deep connection to baseball while showcasing baseball fashion as a powerful form of cultural storytelling.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A London judge has dismissed part of a lawsuit against the British band The 1975 over the lead singer\u2019s gay kiss that led Malaysian authorities to shut down a music festival",
      "LONDON -- Members of the British band The 1975 cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Matty Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage, a London judge ruled Monday.",
      "The organizer of the Good Vibes Festival is seeking 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country's anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "Future Sound Asia sued The 1975 Productions LLP in the High Court over breach of contract and said its four members owed a duty of care. But the band\u2019s lawyer argued that the suit should only target the company \u2014 not the musicians.",
      "Judge William Hansen said the claims against the band members were \"bad as a matter of law and that there is no good reason why the matter should go to trial.\" He allowed the case to proceed against the company, but ordered FSA to pay 100,000 pounds ($126,000) in legal costs.",
      "Band attorney Edmund Cullen had argued the claim was an \u201cillegitimate, artificial and incoherent\u201d attempt \u201cto pin liability on individuals\u201d because FSA only had a contract with the band's company.",
      "FSA\u2019s attorney Andrew Burns said authorities had initially refused to let the band perform because of reports about Healy\u2019s drug addiction and subsequent recovery. They relented after the band promised he would follow guidelines and regulations, he said.",
      "When the band played the same festival in 2016, they had agreed not to swear, smoke, drink, take off clothes or talk about religion and politics on stage, Burns said.",
      "Burns said the band deliberately provoked Malaysian authorities in 2023 by smuggling a bottle of wine on stage, and through Healy's \u201cobscene speech\u201d and the kiss. He said the band also performed a \u201csecond-rate set of songs\u201d to upset the crowd.",
      "\u201cThey could be argued to have been on a frolic of their own rather than simply acting within the course of their ordinary role as LLP members,\" Burns said.",
      "The band was supposed to be paid $350,000 (276,000 pounds) for a one-hour set, Burns said.",
      "The show wasn't the first time Healy made a political statement in the name of LGBTQ+ rights: he kissed a male fan at a 2019 concert in the United Arab Emirates, which outlaws same-sex sexual activity.",
      "After the show in the Malaysian capital, The 1975 canceled its concerts in Taiwan and Jakarta, Indonesia.",
      "The Malaysian government has blacklisted the band."

      "The other major awards \u2014 including the BAFTAs, the Producers Guild Awards, the Directors Guild Awards and the Golden Globes \u2014 have all had their say. But actors make up the largest piece of the film academy pie, so their picks often correspond strongly with Academy Award winners.",

But Edward Berger\u2019s \u201cConclave\u201d won last weekend at the BAFTAs, the latest wrench in an award season full of them. That\u2019s included the unlikely rise and precipitous fall of another top contender, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",

Can \u201cWicked\u201d make a late push and win the guild\u2019s top award, best ensemble? Can Adrien Brody hold off Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet for best actor? Can Mikey Madison keep the momentum and win best actress over Demi Moore?",
      "The 31st SAG Awards will be streamed live by Netflix beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern. An official pre-show will start an hour earlier, also on Netflix.

      "The latest cases, confirmed by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program, were detected in Sindh and Punjab provinces. This brings the total number of polio cases in Pakistan to five since January 2025. In 2024, Pakistan recorded 74 polio cases.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A nurse who survived an armed man\u2019s attack on an intensive care unit in a Pennsylvania hospital said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that she was held against him as a shield at gunpoint, arms zip-tied behind her back, as they walked through a doorway and encountered a phalanx of responding police officers.",
      "Nurse Tosha Trostle wrote that she had begged the attacker to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. When they encountered police, she prayed as she heard gunshots and smelled smoke, then heard bullet casings hitting the floor, she wrote.",

      "Authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49, brought a gun and zip ties to UPMC Memorial Hospital in York on Saturday morning and was holding hostages when responding officers fatally shot him.",
      "West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte, 30, was shot and killed. Two other officers and three hospital employees were wounded, authorities said.",
      "Trostle recounted that she had been drawing blood when she heard a commotion and went into a hallway.",
      "\u201cAfter all I thought I was responding to a staff assist, patient fall, one in a dozen possible occurrences; not an active shooter. When I rounded the corner of the back hall I was met in the distance by the shooter holding my coworker, Jess, at gunpoint,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Her colleague, Jessica Breighner, was forced to zip-tie her.",
      "\u201cI saw the fear in her eyes, fear does not sound like enough really though,\u201d Trostle wrote.",

      "Jason Huff, Breighner\u2019s partner of more than 20 years, also described the incident in a separate Facebook post on Wednesday that said the attacker had pulled the trigger three times with the gun against Breighner\u2019s head, but it was apparently out of ammunition.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when she knew it was time to take her shot,\u201d Huff wrote. \u201cShe broke her zip ties while he reloaded and ran -- thank God.\u201d",

      "York County District Attorney Tim Barker said Saturday that Archangel-Ortiz appeared to have had recent contact with the intensive care unit \u201cfor a medical purpose involving another person\u201d but declined to elaborate.",
      "Asked about the nurses\u2019 accounts, a UPMC spokesperson said the health system prioritizes safety and privacy but referred questions to law enforcement.",

      "After the shooting, she was led down a stairway. In the days since, the memory has haunted Trostle and her family, she said.",

      "The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in contract cuts after an uproar that critical veterans health services were harmed, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs has temporarily suspended billions of dollars in planned contract cuts following concerns that the move would hurt critical veterans' health services, lawmakers and veterans service organizations said Wednesday.",
      "The pause affects hundreds of VA contracts that Secretary Doug Collins a day earlier described as simply consulting deals, whose cancellation would save $2 billion as the Trump administration works to slash costs across the federal government.",
      "\u201cNo more paying consultants to do things like make Power Point slides and write meeting minutes!\u201d Collins posted to X Tuesday, in a post that was then lauded by Elon Musk, President Donald Trump's cost-cutting chief at the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The Associated Press has obtained the full list of 875 affected contracts, which shows the cuts would affect everything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The list underscores how the Trump administration\u2019s approach to broad spending reductions has immediate and potentially unintended consequences, generating significant concern not just among Democrats but also Republican lawmakers.",
      "The VA said in a statement to the AP that its review of the contracts \u201cis ongoing and not final.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not be eliminating any benefits or services to Veterans or VA beneficiaries, and there will be no negative impact to VA health care, benefits or beneficiaries. We are always going to take care of Veterans at VA. Period,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement.",
      "One contract that was on the chopping block supports assessing veterans' disability ratings. Those evaluations are one of the most important steps needed for a veteran to qualify to have their medical care covered and receive financial compensation if they were wounded due to their military service. An inaccurate rating can have a long-term impact on their access to care and financial support.",
      "Another contract is intended to identify and integrate data between the Pentagon, VA and other agencies to support the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022, a bill passed in 2022 to increase veterans\u2019 access to care.",
      "Some of the other contracts marked for cancellation also directly affect veterans' care.",
      "At a joint House and Senate hearing Wednesday with veterans services organizations, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal submitted a partial list of the affected contracts his office had received and submitted it for the congressional record.",
      "If carried out, these cuts \u201cwill harm veterans and taxpayers for years to come,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement.",
      "In an internal VA email sent Tuesday and seen by the AP, a VA contracting official said DOGE targeted contracts broadly categorized as \u201cconsulting\u201d but they included ones that if terminated would halt chemotherapy and imaging services.",
      "Contracts to calibrate radiation detection equipment, to support cancer care and veterans cemetery management, among others were also targeted. Another would directly affect the ability to assess toxic exposure because it supports more than 24,000 research requests to look through the National Archives and Records Administration and other government sources to validate service and toxic exposure events.",
      "Former VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served in the Trump administration in his first term, said that while the agency has gotten larger and there are likely savings to be found, the VA grew, in part, to meet the large expansion of veterans enrolling to get care under the PACT Act. More than 740,000 veterans signed up for coverage after the law passed, according to a September 2024 VA press release.",
      "\u201cI do think slowing down and pausing to see what the consequences are, even if they are unintended consequences, is important to do,\u201d Shulkin told The Associated Press.",
      "Veterans service organizations called for \u201dimmediate transparency\u201d on what contracts were affected.",
      "\u201cWith funding suddenly stripped from contractors processing claims, conducting medical screenings and expanding outreach, there are growing concerns veterans will face delays, denials and disruptions in accessing critical services,\u201d said Rosie Torres, executive director of Burn Pits 360.",

      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d starring Natalie Morales and Sonequa Martin-Green, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow",
      "Even for a film titled \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d the opening scenes of Kyle Hausmann-Stoke\u2019s movie have a startling rhythm.",
      "First, two female American soldiers are riding in a Humvee in Afghanistan 2016 blasting Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella.\u201d They are clearly friends, and more concerned with the music coming through loudly than enemy fire. Merit (Natalie Morales) tells Zoe (Sonequa Martin-Green) that they ever set foot in \u201csome dopy group therapy,\" to please kill her.",
      "Cut to years later, they\u2019re sitting in a counseling meeting for veterans and Morales\u2019 character has a sour look at her face. She turns to her friend: \u201cDid we survive the dumbest war of all time just to sit here all broken and kumbaya and ouchie-my-feelings?\u201d",
      "But after this rush of cavalier soldiering and bitter sarcasm comes a sobering moment. Merit blinks her eyes and is instead staring at an empty chair. Zoe isn\u2019t there at all.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d co-starring Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, confronts a dark reality of post-combat struggle with as much humor and playfulness as it does trauma and sorrow. It comes from a real place, and you can tell. Hausmann-Stoke is himself a veteran and \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is dedicated to a pair of his platoon mates who committed suicide. The opening titles note the film was \u201cinspired by a true story.\u201d",
      "Audience disinterest has characterized many, though not all, of the films about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the output has pretty much dried up over the years. \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d feels like it was made with an awareness of that trend and as a rebuke to it.",
      "This is an often breezy and funny movie for what, on paper, is a difficult and dark story. But the comic tone of \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is, itself, a spirited rejection to not just the heaviness of many films about veterans but of the grief that can consume those who have dealt with loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Throughout the film, Zoe appears only to Merit, ala Brad Pitt in \u201cFight Club,\u201d singing alongside her as she drives or impatiently waiting for Merit to come home from a run. Whether this, following some unspecified end to Zoe, is a healthy thing or not for Merit is increasingly in doubt. Merit needs to cling to her friend, or her memory of her. But Zoe also rolls her eyes at any suggestion of talking through her feelings. Zoe, as an apparition, is both the cause and relief to her pain.",
      "There are a few other points of view, courtesy of two of our finest actors. Freeman plays the counselor of Merit\u2019s mandatory group sessions. He refuses to let Zoe coast. To pressure her to share and participate, he threatens withholding Zoe's certification.",
      "Meanwhile, Merit\u2019s grandfather, Dale (Harris), a Vietnam vet, has just been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s. Merit is tasked with keeping an eye on him at his rural lakeside cabin and helping him into a retirement community \u2014 a prospect that infuriates him. As Merit\u2019s original inspiration for joining the army, Dale \u2014 stubborn and tight-lipped \u2014 epitomizes an earlier generation of soldier.",
      "In toggling between the present and wartime flashbacks, \u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe\u201d is sometimes a bumpy ride. The interplay between Merit and Zoe also shifts, beginning more like a buddy comedy and veering toward horror-film haunting, especially when Merit hesitantly agrees to a date with a worker at the prospective retirement home (Utkarsh Ambudkar).",
      "But the movie\u2019s earnestness carries it through these less smooth moments. So does the cast. Any opportunity to see Freeman or Harris, still at the top of their games, is a chance to be treasured. Freeman is typically sage and Harris characteristically fiery. But the leads are even better. Morales is at her finest as a cynical soldier, devoted to her friend but little else. And with compelling poise, Martin-Green (\"The Walking Dead\") carries a movie that at times can feel scattershot but never not sincere.",
      "\u201cMy Dead Friend Zoe,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language. Running time: 101 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The number of babies born in South Korea has rebounded for the first time in nine years",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The number of babies born in South Korea rebounded for the first time in nine years in 2024, welcome news for a country grappling with one of the the world\u2019s most serious demographic crises.",
      "South Korea\u2019s statistics agency said Wednesday that 238,300 babies were born last year, an increase of 8,300 from a year earlier. It said the country\u2019s fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies born to each woman in their reproductive years \u2014 was 0.75 in 2024, up from 0.72 in 2023.",
      "It\u2019s the first time that the yearly number of births has increased since 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say this is a considerably meaningful rebound,\u201d Choi Yoon Kyung, an expert at the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education, said Thursday. \u201cWe still have to see figures in the next few years to find whether it was a temporary rebound or it was driven by structural changes.\u201d",
      "Park Hyun Jung, a senior official at the Statistics Korea, said that her agency assessed the increase in births was partly attributable to an increase in marriages among couples who delayed weddings during the COVID-19 pandemic period.",
      "Park said that another factor behind the rebound was a growing number of people entering their early 30s. She also cited a government survey showing a small increase in the number of young people hoping to have children after marriage.",
      "Official data show South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has been the lowest in the developed world in recent years. In 2022, it was the only country whose fertility rate was below 1 among members of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "The low fertility rate poses a major potential threat to South Korea\u2019s economy, Asia's fourth largest, as it will cause labor shortages and greater welfare spendings. South Korea\u2019s central and regional governments have been increasingly offering a variety of financial incentives and other support programs to those who give birth to children.",
      "But experts say that it will be extremely difficult to address the country's demographic challenges as young people don't want to have babies, owing to a mix of factors that make it difficult to raise them in the brutally competitive, fast-changing country. They cite expensive housing, low levels of social mobility, the huge cost of raising and educating children and a culture that requires women to handle far more of childcare.",
      "Park said that the fertility rate will likely stay on an upward trend at least for another year. But observers say it remains to be seen whether the rate will go back down as post-pandemic marriages even out. The country\u2019s demographic structure will also eventually see a drop in people in their early 30s.",
      "Some experts argue that the government should focus on supporting young couples who want to have babies, rather than providing broad programs meant to address diverse social problems.",
      "\u201cThere are still people with solid wills to have a family and babies. When we help them realize their hopes, our fertility rate won\u2019t suffer a steep, 45-degree drop,\u201d Choi said."

Cases were most common in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where incomes are low and health services insufficient.",
      "In places where measles have largely been eradicated, cases have been spread by travelers from other countries.",
      "While measles-related deaths declined slightly in 2023, the number of outbreaks increased. Major outbreaks took place in 57 countries in 2023, including India and Indonesia, Russia, Yemen and Iraq. The largest number of cases in 2023 was 311,500 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "The worldwide rate of childhood vaccinations has fallen in recent years, to 83% in 2023 from 86% in 2019, partly due to disruptions in immunization and health care due to the pandemic.",
      "The WHO estimates that vaccination helped to prevent more than 60 million deaths worldwide between 2000 and 2023, as efforts to get the shots to more people ramped up. In 2000, 800,062 people are estimated to have died of measles. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, major epidemics caused about 2.6 million deaths a year.",
      "Measles is so highly infectious that 95% immunity is required to prevent epidemics, the WHO says. Put another way, it infects about 9 of 10 people exposed if they lack immunity.",
      "The WHO and others are backing an effort called \u201cImmunization Agenda 2021-2030,\u201d to push for elimination of measles.",
      "Independent experts declared the Americas free of endemic measles in 2016 but that status was lost in 2018 due to measles outbreaks in Brazil and Venezuela. Reduced vaccination rates are undermining efforts to fully eradicate the disease, experts say.",
      "Global health organizations and other groups have increased their efforts to speed up immunization programs and close the gaps in prevention."

      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \u201cTrans rights are human rights\u201d and chanting slogans including \u201cNo hate in our state!\u201d There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \u201cShame!\u201d as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and delivered a fierce defense of it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens recent \u201ccommonsense\u201d laws to ban transgender participation in sports and access to bathrooms.",
      "\u201cThe legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\u201d Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers\u2019 actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state\u2019s hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa\u2019s current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state\u2019s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\u201d Wichtendahl said. \u201cThe sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\u201d",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa\u2019s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women\u2019s sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",

      "Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth",
      "EL PASO, Texas -- On the Texas border, Dr. Hector Granados treats children with diabetes at his El Paso clinics and makes hospital rounds under the shadow of accusations that have thrown his career into jeopardy: providing care to transgender youth.",
      "In what's believed to be a U.S. first, Texas is suing Granados and two other physicians over claims that they violated the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, calling the doctors \u201cscofflaws\u201d in lawsuits filed last fall that threaten to impose steep fines and revoke their medical licenses. He denies the accusations, and all three doctors have asked courts to dismiss the cases.",
      "The cases are a pivotal test of intensifying Republican efforts to prevent such treatments, including President Donald Trump's executive order that would bar federal support for gender-affirming care for youth under 19.",
      "Some hospitals have already begun unwinding services for pediatric patients. But, so far, only Texas is demonstrating what punishing doctors looks like when bans are allegedly broken.",
      "Granados, in an interview with The Associated Press, said he was meticulous in halting transgender care before Texas' ban took effect in 2023. He denied that he continued prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to transitioning patients and said he was initially unclear which patients, who are not named in the lawsuit, he is accused of wrongfully treating.",
      "The other accused doctors \u2014 both in Dallas \u2014 are under temporary court orders not to see patients and only practice medicine in research and academic settings.",
      "\u201cLooking at the patients was hard because they were kind of disappointed of what was going on,\u201d Granados said of ending their care. \u201cBut it was something that needed to be followed because it\u2019s the law.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits are believed to be the first time a state has brought enforcement under laws that ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors, which Republicans have enacted in 27 states, including this month in Kansas over the Democratic governor\u2019s veto. Although those accused of violating bans face criminal charges in some states, they do not in Texas.",
      "Nationwide, doctors and hospital executives are reevaluating transgender health programs that carry a widening risk of litigation and losing federal funding. For transgender Americans, the climate has narrowed options for care and deepened fears.",
      "Trump has launched a broad charge against transgender rights quickly in his second term, signing executive orders that include barring schools from using federal education dollars to support students who are socially transitioning. Supporters say restrictions protect vulnerable children from what they see as a \u201cradical\u201d ideology about gender and making irreversible medical decisions.",
      "The Texas lawsuits were brought by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously gone beyond the state's borders to launch investigations into gender-affirming treatment.",
      "His office did not respond to requests for an interview. At a court hearing Wednesday involving the Dallas doctors, an attorney in Paxton\u2019s office declined to comment and referred questions to the agency\u2019s press office.",
      "\u201cI will enforce the law to the fullest extent to prevent any doctor from providing these dangerous drugs to kids,\u201d Paxton said in a statement this month.",
      "Granados is one of two pediatric endocrinologists in El Paso, a desert city of about 700,000 where mountains rise in the distance.",
      "Granados, 48, is from Ciudad Juarez, the neighboring Mexican city that sprawls out south of El Paso. He said that after attending medical school in Mexico he completed additional training in New York and Connecticut but he wanted to return to what he said is an underserved region.",
      "He opened a gender clinic at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in El Paso before starting his own practice in 2019. Before the ban, Granados said, treating transgender youth was just an extension of his practice that also treats youth with diabetes, growth problems and early puberty.",
      "He said he accepted transgender patients only if they had first received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a mental health provider.",
      "\u201cIt was not different from doing everything else that a pediatric endocrinologist does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just taking care of children who required that specific therapy.\u201d",
      "Emiliana Edwards was among them. Now 18, she called Granados an \u201camazing\u201d caregiver who carefully explained her gender-affirming treatment. But at her first appointment after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the ban in 2023, Edwards said the room felt different, \u201clike there were wires everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like we couldn\u2019t talk about anything really, even the most simple stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "Her mother, Lorena Edwards, said Granados put a \u201ccold stop\u201d to her daughter\u2019s care.",
      "\u201cIt was just: \u2018I don\u2019t provide that care anymore.\u2019 And it was done,\u201d she said.",
      "At the heart of Texas' lawsuits against Granados, Dr. May Lau and Dr. M. Brett Cooper are allegations of prescribing treatment to transition their patients' sex after the ban took effect.",
      "In one instance, the state accuses Granados of prescribing testosterone to a 16-year-old, alleging that although the doctor's records identify the patient as male, the teenager's sex assigned at birth is female. Granados and Lau are also accused of having instructed patients to wait until after the ban was in place to fill prescriptions.",
      "Granados does not dispute that he has continued prescribing puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy. He said those treatments are not for gender transition but for children with endocrine disorders, which occur when hormone levels are too high or too low.",
      "He said he prescribes testosterone for many reasons, including for patients whose testicles don\u2019t work or had to be removed because of cancer. Others have brain tumors, or surgery or radiation to the brain, that impact puberty. Patients with early onset puberty also need puberty blockers, he said.",
      "Attorneys for Lau said she has always complied with the law and the claims have no merit. Attorneys for Cooper did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is really part of a bigger pattern of extremism within the state that even other states have shied away from replicating,\u201d said Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal for the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "Transgender adults and youth make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to estimates by the Williams Institute, an LGBTQ+ research center at the UCLA School of Law.",
      "Granados' trial has been set for late October; trial dates have not yet been set yet for Lau and Cooper. While the cases are pending, Lau and Cooper agreed to practice medicine only in research and academic settings and not see patients.",
      "Neither Lau or Cooper attended the Wednesday hearing in their cases by a judge who is set to decide where their trials will be held.",
      "Under Texas' ban, the state medical board is instructed to revoke the licenses of doctors who are found to have violated the law.",
      "Lorena Edwards said she watched her daughter thrive during her transition then descend into melancholy as laws targeting transgender rights gained steam.",
      "Emiliana Edwards has switched to receiving treatment in neighboring New Mexico \u2014 where gender-affirming care is legal \u2014 but she said attacks on the transgender community have taken a toll on her mental health.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re normal people, too, and we\u2019re just trying to live,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reinstating some of the hundreds of staffers it fired last week",
      "Associated Press -- Barely a week after mass firings at the Food and Drug Administration, some probationary staffers received unexpected news over the weekend: The government wants them back.",
      "Beginning Friday night, FDA employees overseeing medical devices and other key areas received calls and emails notifying them that their recent terminations had been \u201crescinded effective immediately,\u201d according to messages viewed by The Associated Press.",
      "Three FDA staffers impacted by the decisions spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity because they planned to continue working for the agency and weren\u2019t authorized to discuss its internal procedures.",
      "The reversal is the latest example of President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk's chaotic approach to cost-cutting, which has resulted in several agencies firing, and then scrambling to rehire, employees responsible for nuclear weapons, national parks and other government services.",
      "The FDA reinstatements followed pushback by lobbyists for the medical device industry, which pays the agency hundreds of millions of dollars annually to hire extra scientists to promptly review products. The industry's leading trade group said Monday \u201ca sizeable number\u201d of device reviewers would apparently be returning to FDA.",
      "\u201cThis would be welcome news, and I appreciate the administration for acting quickly,\u201d AdvaMed CEO Scott Whitaker said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe all share the same goal \u2014 an efficient, effective FDA review process that helps advance the medical technologies American patients depend on.\u201d",
      "FDA staffers said entire teams of five or more medical device reviewers had been reinstated. There did not appear to be a similar effort to rehire staffers in other parts of the agency, including its food and tobacco centers.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t released official numbers on the terminations, but former FDA officials have pegged the number at roughly 700, with more than 220 coming from the medical device center. That would represent roughly 10% of the program's total staffing.",
      "The FDA did not respond to requests Monday about how many employees were being reinstated.",
      "Like other agencies, the FDA terminations went to employees in their probationary period, typically the first two years of federal employment. But that approach resulted in the terminations across key areas where the agency has been working to beef up staffing, including rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence and digital health. The cuts also included agency leaders who were recently hired for senior roles.",
      "\u201cThe disarray caused by the wholesale termination of a wide swath of device center staff was counterproductive and appears to have caused a variety of unintended and negative results,\u201d said Steve Silverman, a former FDA device official who now runs a consulting firm. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see a shift in the opposite direction that recognizes the critical expertise of these staffers.\u201d",
      "Many reviewers have advanced degrees in specialized medical and technological fields. They can typically earn more in the private sector than in government.",
      "Last week, the lobbying group AdvaMed pushed back on the firings, calling on Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to reverse course. The group warned that the cuts would result in slower approvals for companies and fewer new treatment options for patients.",
      "\u201cFDA will lose hundreds of new employees, the best and most innovative hires under our most recent agreement,\u201d Whitaker wrote in a statement posted online. He noted that the hiring of FDA device reviewers is largely financed through an ongoing five-year agreement between the FDA and medical device companies.",
      "More than half the device program\u2019s $791 million budget last year came from industry fees, according to federal figures. In return, the FDA is obligated to meet certain benchmarks for quickly and predictably reviewing applications for new and updated devices.",
      "FDA staffers who were reinstated said their immediate supervisors received no explanation or advance notice on the decisions. Instead, staffers received calls or emails from the FDA\u2019s \u201cOffice of Talent Solutions,\u201d informing them that their access to FDA computer systems and offices had been restored.",
      "\u201cWe are so grateful to still have you working for the FDA and serving the American public!\u201d the emails concluded.",
      "A week earlier, the same employees received emails stating that they were \u201cnot fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency\u2019s current needs.\u201d",
      "Nearly half the FDA\u2019s budget, or about $3.3 billion, comes from fees paid by drugmakers, device and tobacco companies. The result is that broad cuts to those programs won\u2019t add much toward Musk\u2019s stated goal of shrinking the federal budget.",
      "But the financial support of industry fees did not appear to help staffers in other parts of the agency.",
      "The agency\u2019s tobacco center \u2014 which reviews new products like electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches \u2014 is 100% funded by industry fees. But there did not appear to be an effort to rehire any of the estimated 100 or so employees fired from that center.",
      "Similarly, the recalls did not appear to apply to the agency\u2019s food program, which recently went though a major restructuring to better oversee essential products like infant formula and baby food.",
      "Last week, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, Jim Jones resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP. The employees fired included those with \u201chighly technical expertise in nutrition, infant formula, food safety response\u201d and chemical safety, Jones said.",

      "VANNES, France -- A former surgeon is set to stand trial in France on Monday for the alleged rape or sexual abuse of 299 victims, most of them children who were his patients, in what investigators and his own notebooks describe as a pattern of violence spanning over three decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, now 74, will face hundreds of victims during a four-month trial in Vannes, Brittany. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.",
      "He does not deny the allegations, though says he doesn't remember everything. Some survivors have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to prison terms ranging from three to 20 years.",
      "Child protection and women\u2019s rights groups and medical community associations have called for a rally on Monday in front of the courthouse where Le Scouarnec will be tried.",
      "The case began in 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor said Le Scouarnec had touched her over the fence separating their properties.",
      "A subsequent search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions, according to investigation documents.",
      "In 2020, Le Scouarnec was convicted of rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",

      "Years later, she described feeling overwhelmed when she learned that her name appeared in Le Scouarnec\u2019s notebooks.",
      "\u201cThat was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,\u201d she told public broadcaster France 3. \u201cI felt like I had lost control of everything.

      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn\u2019t allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral",
      "Utah appears to be the first state ready to put a full ban on fluoride in public water systems under a bill that doesn't allow cities or communities to decide whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral.",
      "A bill sponsor and an organization opposed to fluoridating water said Utah's proposal would set a precedent in the U.S. \u2014 and it would come as new federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, which is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Utah's bill cleared its final hurdle in the legislature Friday, and heads to Gov. Spencer Cox for his approval. A spokesperson for Cox didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he'd sign it.",
      "Already, some cities across the country have tossed fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "Utah ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data published in 2022 by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "Lawmakers who backed the bill, which was sponsored by state Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius and state Sen. Kirk Cullimore, said putting fluoride in the water is too expensive.",
      "\u201cI don't dispute that there can be positive benefits from fluoride, which is why the bill also includes a deregulation of the prescription,\u201d Gricius said in a text message to The Associated Press, referencing a fluoride pill. \u201cThis isn't anti-fluoride legislation, it is pro-informed consent and individual choice.\u201d",
      "Fluoridation is the the most cost effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "\u201cI think the anti-fluoride people, they\u2019re latching onto Kennedy\u2019s opportunity with his beliefs and using that now as a way to kind of get in the door to stop water fluoridation,\u201d Koci said.",
      "She added that fluoridated public water is often the only form of preventive dental care for some people, and the impacts may be most visible in low-income Utah residents.",
      "Fluoride strengthens the teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population drinks fluoridated water.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state's biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "In 2023, voters in Brigham City, north of Salt Lake City, struck down a measure that would have removed fluoride from its public water supplies. The proposal was defeated by more than a two-to-one margin.",
      "Val Radmall, the executive director of the Utah Dental Association, said he and others met with Gricius to try to get her to rethink the bill. He worked in a non-fluoridated community for three decades, and said the lack of fluoride showed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d have a patient come in without cavities or anything else like that, and I\u2019d say, \u2019You didn\u2019t grow up here. Where did you grow up?' ... because everybody here has lots of cavities!\u201d he said.",

      "The interval between the onset of symptoms \u2013 which include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding \u2013 and death has been 48 hours in most cases and \u201cthat\u2019s what\u2019s really worrying,\u201d said Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center.",
      "These \u201chemorrhagic fever\u201d symptoms are commonly linked to known deadly viruses, such as Ebola, dengue, Marburg and yellow fever, but researchers have ruled these out based on tests of more than a dozen samples collected so far.",
      "The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, with 419 cases recorded and 53 deaths.",
      "The outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said Monday.",
      "There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.",
      "After the second outbreak of the mystery disease began in the village of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases were sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples were negative for common hemorrhagic fever diseases, although some tested positive for malaria.",
      "Last year, another mystery flu-like illness that killed dozens of people in another part of Congo was determined likely to be malaria."

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- An annual United Nations conference on biodiversity that ran out of time last year will resume its work Tuesday in Rome with money at the top of the agenda.",
      "That is, how to spend what's been pledged so far \u2014 and how to raise a lot more to help preserve plant and animal life on Earth.",
      "The talks in Colombia known as COP16 yielded some significant outcomes before they broke up in November, including an agreement that requires companies that benefit from genetic resources in nature \u2014 say, by developing medicines from rainforest plants \u2014 to share the benefits. And steps were taken to give Indigenous peoples and local communities a stronger voice in conservation matters.",
      "But two weeks turned out to be not enough time to get everything done.",
      "The Cali talks followed the historic 2022 COP15 accord in Montreal, which included 23 measures aimed at protecting biodiversity. Those included putting 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems under protection by 2030, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework.",
      "\u201cMontreal was about the \u2018what\u2019 \u2014 what are we all working towards together?\u201d said Georgina Chandler, head of policy and campaigns for the Zoological Society London. \u201cCali was supposed to focus on the \u2018how\u2019 \u2014 putting the plans and the financing in place to ensure we can actually implement this framework.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey eventually lost a quorum because people simply went home,\u201d said Linda Krueger of The Nature Conservancy, who is in Rome for the two days of talks \u201cAnd so now we\u2019re having to finish these last critical decisions, which are some of the the nitty gritty decisions on financing, on resource mobilization and on the planning and monitoring and reporting requirements under the Global Biodiversity Framework.\u201d",
      "The overall financial aim was to achieve $20 billion a year in the fund by 2025, and then $30 billion by 2030. So far, only $383 million had been pledged as of November, from 12 nations or sub-nations: Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Province of Qu\u00e9bec, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Participants will discuss establishing a \u201cglobal financing instrument for biodiversity\u201d intended to effectively distribute the money raised. And a big part of the talks will be about raising more money.",
      "Chandler and Kruger both said the finance points at Colombia's talks were particularly contentious.",

      "Oscar Soria, chief executive of The Common Initiative, a think tank specializing in global economic and environmental policy, was pessimistic about raising a great deal more money.",

      "\u201cWhat was supposed to be a good Colombian telenovela in which people will actually bring the right resources, and the happy ending of bringing their money, could actually end up being a tragic Italian opera, where no one actually agrees to anything and everyone loses,\u201d Soria said.",
      "Susana Muhamad, Colombia's former environment minister and the COP16 president, said she's hopeful of \u201ca good message from Rome.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat message is that still, even with a very fragmented geopolitical landscape, with a world increasingly in conflict, we can still get an agreement on some fundamental issues,\" Muhamad said in a statement. \"And one of the most important is the need to protect life in this crisis of climate change and biodiversity.\u201d",

      "Chandler said deforestation in the Amazon has far-reaching impacts across South America, just as it does in the Congo Basin and other major biodiverse regions worldwide.",

      "An international border fence may soon split the village of Longwa in two",
      "LONGWA, India -- To the people who live there, Longwa is a typical hilltop village. The most imposing structure is a corrugated tin roof belonging to the Angh, a hereditary tribal chief.",
      "But recently, residents have been worried about another, less visible, local landmark: the border between India and Myanmar, which runs right through the village's center.",
      "National boundaries never mattered before to the local Konyak tribe. \u201cI eat in Myanmar and sleep in India,\u201d says Tonyei Phawang, the Angh, whose house sits on the border.",
      "The Indian government is now seeking to stop border crossings for the first time, revoking a system that made it legal for Indigenous people to cross freely and threatening to build a border fence that could cut villages like Longwa in two.",
      "On a Thursday in December, Longwa's marketplace was bustling with shoppers from the Myanmar side, motorbikes loaded with as much salt, flour, biscuits, clothes, milk, tea, soap as they could carry. The nearest town with a market on the other side of the border is Lahe, a full day\u2019s drive away.",
      "Locals have long come and gone to shop, study or seek medical care, with no sign that they're crossing an international border except a border marker sitting on a hilltop in the village. The Angh and village council members say their forefathers had no idea that the concrete pillar was meant to divide them when it was built in the early 1970s.",
      "\u201cAt that time we had no idea this is India or Myanmar. It was a free land. There was nobody who understood English or Hindi. They understood nothing,\u201d Phawang says.",
      "Like dozens of other Indigenous Naga tribes, the Konyak\u2019s land straddles the mountains that divide India and Myanmar. Naga villages are usually built on hilltops for security, something that wasn't considered when the British East India Company drew the border in an agreement with the then-Kingdom of Burma.",
      "The Constitution of India does not allow dual citizenship, but people in Longwa see themselves as belonging to both countries.",
      "\u201cI am from both India and Burma,\u201d Phawang said, using another name for the country officially known as Myanmar. \u201cI vote in the Burmese election. And when the Indian election comes I vote there too.\u201d",
      "Phawang is chief of six Konyak villages in India and more than 30 in Myanmar, whose residents pay allegiance with a yearly feast as they have for some 10 generations.",
      "The reach of the Indian state was very limited in these borderlands until recently. People here often have documents from both governments, said Khriezo Yhome, a senior fellow and editor at Asian Confluence, a think tank working to create an understanding of eastern South Asian. \u201cHowever, there was practically no way for the state to do anything to check it.\u201d",
      "Until recently, residents from both sides could travel legally within 16 kilometers (9.9 miles) of the border, but that started to change in February 2024, when the government revoked the Free Movement Regime \u201cto ensure the internal security of the country and to maintain the demographic structure of India\u2019s North Eastern states bordering Myanmar.\u201d",
      "Change has come slowly in Longwa: it took almost a year before soldiers stationed in the village began checking documents, and Longwa residents still move freely after their shifts end in the early afternoon. But people from other villages in Myanmar are afraid to travel beyond Longwa to reach schools or medical care, said B. Phohi Konyak, a former local leader of an organization representing Konyak women.",
      "Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said the government has decided to construct a fence along the entire 1,643-kilometer (1,021-mile) long Indo-Myanmar border.",
      "If it follows the legal border, it would have to cut through dozens of houses. Of the 990 buildings in the village, 170 lie on the boundary line \u2014 including a government school, the church and an army camp.",
      "Wangron Konyak, 23, drove five hours on his motorcycle from the village of Momkho to pick up his sister as school closed for vacation. \u201cIf we are not allowed to come this side then we will suffer a lot. For those studying in Myanmar school it will be alright, but people like my sister who study in India will be very affected.\u201d",
      "Residents and state officials are rejecting the changes.",
      "The Nagaland state government passed a resolution opposing the end of the Free Movement Regime and plans for border fencing, and on Feb. 3 Longwa residents staged a protest carrying placards with slogans like \u201cRespect Indigenous rights, not colonial legacy!\u201d",
      "Yhome, the expert, said that an effort to stop locals from crossing the border could violate the U.N. Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People, which seeks to protect the integrity of border-straddling communities.",
      "\u201cFor us there is no Burma Longwa or India Longwa,\" Yanlang, a 45-year-old village council member. \"How can one village and one family be divided?\u201d asked"

      "The official Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un oversaw the missile tests off the country\u2019s west coast Wednesday. They were the North\u2019s fourth missile launch event this year and the second of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The launches were designed to inform \u201cthe enemies, who are seriously violating our security environment and fostering and escalating the confrontation environment,\u201d of the North Korean military\u2019s counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations, KCNA said.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction over the results of the drills and said the military must be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons, the report said.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement later Friday that it had detected and tracked the North Korean launches. It said the South Korean military maintains readiness to repel any potential provocation by North Korea based on the solid South Korea-U.S. military alliance.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has boasted of his summitry with Kim during his first term and said he would reach out to Kim again. North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s overture as it continues its typical aggressive rhetoric against the U.S. and weapons testing activities.",

It cited the recent U.S.-South Korean aerial exercise involving a U.S. B-1B bomber and other reported activities involving U.S. military assets. A Defense Ministry statement said North Korea will counter the strategic threat of the U.S. with strategic means.",
      "Kim and Trump met three times from 2018-19 to discuss the fate of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, but their diplomacy derailed due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. Kim has since sharply increased the pace of weapons tests to expand and modernize his nuclear arsenal. Having a bigger nuclear arsenal now, experts say Kim would think he could win greater U.S. concessions if he revives diplomacy with Trump.",

      "Haq is the son of Maulana Samiul Haq, known as the \u201cfather of the Taliban,\u201d who was killed in a knife attack at his home in 2018.",
      "Haq\u2019s family confirmed he was killed in Friday's attack and appealed to his followers to remain peaceful. He was also in charge of the Jamia Haqqania seminary, where many Afghan Taliban had studied in the past two decades.",
      "Zulfiqar Hameed, the provincial police chief, said more than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq\u2019s seminary also had its own security.",
      "Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack, which came ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is expected to start either on Saturday or Sunday subject to the sighting of the crescent moon.",
      "Yawar Zia, a police officer who was wounded in the attack, said he was on a security duty at the seminary when the attack occurred and splinters from the bomb hit him. He was transported to the Qazi Hussain Ahmed Hospital by ambulance.",
      "\u201cAfter offering prayer, Hamidul Haq was leaving the mosque to go home and as he reached the main gate, a powerful explosion occurred, and I fell to the ground, losing consciousness,\u201d Zia told The Associated Press from his hospital bed.",
      "Zahir Shah, a worshipper, said that hundreds of people were leaving the mosque after offering prayers when he heard a powerful blast. He said Haq, accompanied by guards, was heading to his home located within the seminary premises when the attack occurred.",
      "Shah described a chaotic scene with blood and body parts scattered around, adding that the number of casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.",
      "Pakistan has witnessed a surge in attacks in recent years.",
      "As many as 101 people, mostly police officers, were killed in 2023 when a suicide attack targeted a mosque in Peshawar, the capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.",
      "Pakistani authorities have blamed the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, for previous attacks.",
      "The TTP never claim attacks on mosques, saying it does not target places of worship. The TTP is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who seized power in neighboring Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were in the final stages of their pullout from the country after 20 years of war.",
      "Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuary and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban.",
      "Separately on Friday, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying security forces in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta, wounding 10 people, including two soldiers, police and officials said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing, but previous attacks have been blamed on separatists.",
      "Quetta is the capital of Balochistan, which has for years been the scene of a long-running insurgency. Separatists want independence from the central government in Islamabad.",
      "Although Pakistan says it has quelled the insurgency, violence in Baluchistan has continued.",

      "A depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children\u2019s television program",
      "BERLIN -- Forget SpongeBob SquarePants, Sesame Street and the sourdough starter craze: a depressed German loaf of bread named Bernd das Brot is celebrating his 25th anniversary as the reluctant star of a children's television program that accidentally became equally popular with adults.",
      "A cult classic in Germany, Bernd das Brot (Bernd the Bread) is a puppet renowned for his deep, gloomy voice, his perpetual pessimism and his signature expression, \"Mist!\" (Think \u201ccrap!\u201d in English.)",
      "Played and voiced by puppeteer J\u00f6rg Teichgraeber, Bernd is a television presenter who wants nothing to do with TV and can\u2019t wait to go home to stare at the wallpaper.",
      "This year, his friends \u2014 a sheep and a flower bush \u2014 are urging him to become a bread influencer.",
      "Born as a sketch on the back of a napkin in a pizzeria, Bernd\u2019s infamous grimace was drawn by Tommy Krappweis who modeled it after co-creator Norman C\u00f6ster\u2019s face. The duo had been asked to come up with mascots for KiKA, a German children\u2019s public television channel.",
      "Comic artist Georg Graf von Westphalen designed Bernd as a pullman loaf \u2014 white bread typically sliced for sandwiches \u2014 with short arms and a permanent scowl. Bernd channels German stereotypes with his grumpy disposition, penchant for complaining and dry sense of humor and irony.",
      "Bernd's first episode aired on KiKA in 2000 alongside his more-optimistic pals, Chili the Sheep and Briegel the Bush.",
      "Because KiKA is a children's channel, there was typically dead air from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. On Jan. 1, 2003, the network put Bernd's short episodes into the night loop for the first time.",
      "The move brought an adult audience \u2014 often those sitting at home and smoking pot, or returning after a long night of partying \u2014 into Bernd's world, cementing his popularity as a German cult classic.",
      "In 2004, Bernd won the Adolf Grimme Prize \u2014 the German television equivalent of an Emmy \u2014 because the jury said he represents \u201cthe right to be in a bad mood.\u201d",
      "\u201cBernd shows you that you are less vulnerable with humor and self-irony. And perhaps the most important point is: It\u2019s totally okay if you don\u2019t feel well sometimes. That\u2019s completely fine,\u201d Krappweis, Bernd's creator, said in a KiKA Q&A about Bernd's anniversary.",
      "Bernd is depressed for a multitude of reasons, including his failed attempt to be the mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign (that's how he ended up as a TV presenter, as a last resort).",
      "But it's in Episode 85 that we finally learn about Bernd's broken heart.",
      "\u201cA long, long time ago I fell in love with a beautiful, slim baguette. She was so incredibly charming and funny,\u201d Bernd tells Chili and Briegel. \u201cBut unfortunately it was in vain.",
      "\u201cShe only had eyes for this run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain. It was so depressing.\u201d",
      "Despite Bernd\u2019s best efforts \u2014 one of his catchphrases is \u201cI would like to leave this show\u201d \u2014 the episodes have never become stale. He sings, he dances, he\u2019s been to space. He's the star of merchandise, a video game and headlines like \u201cGive Us Our Daily Bernd.\u201d",
      "He was even kidnapped! In 2009, his 2-meter-tall (6.56 feet) statue was stolen from his traditional place outside the town hall in Erfurt, where KiKA is based.",
      "A claim of responsibility surfaced on YouTube, by sympathizers of a group of demonstrators who were protesting a company that had produced cremation ovens for the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz. The demonstrators, however, denied involvement in Bernd\u2019s kidnapping and the video was removed from the internet.",
      "Bernd was held hostage for nearly two weeks before being discovered unharmed in an abandoned barracks.",
      "KiKA is honoring Bernd's 25th anniversary \u2014 despite his complaints \u2014 with new episodes, an update to his hit song and online activities for kids and adults alike. The celebrations begin now, as Bernd\u2019s birthday is Feb. 29.",
      "The latest series will premiere in September as Bernd, Chili and Briegel launch the social media channel \u201cBetter with Bernd\" in their efforts to make him into a bread influencer.",
      "The trio will present inventions to make school, and life, easier for viewers but naturally their concoctions backfire. Bernd instead becomes a defluencer \u2014 and an involuntary trendsetter.",

The dive instructor and other divers in the area, along with Philippine coast guard personnel, immediately launched a search, according to Lapitan.",
      "Melekhov was found unconscious at sea an hour later and was declared dead by doctors in a Batangas hospital, he said.",
      "\u201cThe other Russian diver was found while being attacked by sharks. His right arm, unfortunately, had been severed and the sharks were moving around him,\u201d Lapitan told The Associated Press. \u201cThey somehow managed to pull him away.\u201d",
      "An investigation is underway and the coast guard will meet provincial officials to discuss ways to prevent such deadly incidents at Verde Island and other dive spots, Lapitan said."

      "Mourners are burying the remains of one of the last hostages released in the first phase of the ceasefire between Hamas militants and Israel",
      "JERUSALEM -- Mourners in Israel on Friday were burying the remains of one of the last hostages released in the first phase of the ceasefire between Hamas militants and Israel, as negotiators discussed a second phase of the deal that could end the war in Gaza and see the remaining live hostages returning home.",
      "The funeral procession for Tsachi Idan, an avid soccer fan who was 49 when he was abducted by Hamas militants, began from a football stadium in Tel Aviv towards the cemetery where he was to be buried in a private ceremony.",
      "The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Idan, who was taken from Kibbutz Nahal Oz during the Hamas-led Oct. 7 2023 attack that sparked the war in Gaza, was killed in captivity.",
      "His body was one of four released by Hamas overnight Wednesday to Thursday, in exchange for over 600 Palestinian prisoners, the last planned swap of the ceasefire\u2019s first phase, which began in January.",
      "Idan was the only one of his family to have been taken to Gaza. His eldest daughter, Maayan, was killed as militants shot through the door of their saferoom. Hamas militants broadcast themselves on Facebook live holding the Idan family hostage in their home, as his two younger children pleaded with the militants to let them go.",
      "\u201cMy brother is the real hero. He held on,\u201d Idan\u2019s sister, Noam Idan ben Ezra, said in an interview on Israeli radio Friday. She said Idan had been \u201ca pace away\u201d from being released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023, when more than 100 of the 251 people abducted on Oct. 7 were released.",
      "\u201cTsachi was forsaken twice. The first time when he was kidnapped from his home and the second time when the deal blew up,\u201d she added. \u201cThe fact that Tsachi is not standing next to me today is the outcome of the decision-making and the policy here in Israel. They did not listen to us then, but it\u2019s not too late to listen to us today.\u201d",
      "The relatives of hostages still held in Gaza are ramping up pressure on Netanyahu to secure the release of their loved ones. According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead, and there has been growing concern about the welfare of an unknown number who are still alive, particularly after three hostages who were released Feb. 8 emerged emaciated from captivity.",
      "One of the three, Eli Sharabi, said in an interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 12 Friday that he and other hostages had been held in iron chains, starved and sometimes beaten or humiliated.",
      "\u201cDuring the first three days, my hands are tied behind my back, my legs are tied, with ropes that tear into your flesh, and a bit of food, a bit of water during the day,\u201d he said, in one of the first interviews by a hostage released under the current deal. \u201cI remember not being able to fall asleep because of the pain, the ropes are already digging into your flesh, and every movement makes you want to scream.\u201d",
      "Sharabi only found out after his release that his wife and daughters had been killed during the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Under the terms of the truce Israel and Hamas agreed to, Phase 2 of the ceasefire is meant to involve negotiations on ending the war that has devastated the Gaza Strip. That includes the return of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of all Israeli troops from the Palestinian territory. The return of the bodies of the remaining deceased hostages would occur in Phase 3.",
      "Officials from Israel, Qatar and the United States have started \u201cintensive discussions\u201d on the ceasefire\u2019s second phase in Cairo, Egypt\u2018s state information service said Thursday. Netanyahu's office confirmed he had sent a delegation to Cairo.",
      "\u201cThe mediators are also discussing ways to enhance the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, as part of efforts to alleviate the suffering of the population and support stability in the region,\u201d its statement said.",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire saw 33 hostages, including eight bodies, released in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Netanyahu has vowed to return all the hostages and destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas, which remains in control of Gaza. The Trump administration has endorsed both goals.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear how Israel would destroy Hamas without resuming the war, and Hamas is unlikely to release the remaining hostages \u2014 its main bargaining chips \u2014 without a lasting ceasefire. After suffering heavy losses in the war, the militant group has nonetheless emerged intact, and says it will not give up its weapons.",
      "The ceasefire, brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, ended 15 months of war that erupted after Hamas\u2019 2023 attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, who don\u2019t differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say over half the dead have been women and children.",
      "The fighting displaced an estimated 90% of Gaza\u2019s population and decimated the territory\u2019s infrastructure and health system.",

      "An independent online news agency in Myanmar is alleging that one of its journalists arrested two years ago has been subjected to daily physical and mental abuse after exposing human rights violations in the country\u2019s main prison where he is being held",
      "BANGKOK -- An independent online news agency in Myanmar said Friday that one of its journalists arrested two years ago has been subjected to daily physical and mental abuse after exposing human rights violations in the country\u2019s main prison where he's being held.",
      "The actions taken against photojournalist Sai Zaw Thaike were also to punish him for leaking information from the prison to media outlets, and because the ruling military government holds a grudge against him for his reporting about them before his arrest, said his employer, Swe Win, editor-in-chief of Myanmar Now.",
      "The military government has cracked down heavily on media freedom since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. A report released Wednesday by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said that Myanmar ranked as the world\u2019s third-worst jailer of journalists after China and Israel.",
      "Sai Zaw Thaike was mistreated for allegedly exposing human rights abuses by prison staff of fellow political prisoners during an inspection visit to Insein prison in Yangon by officials from the official Myanmar National Human Rights Commission, Swe Win told The Associated Press, elaborating on a report by Myanmar Now.",
      "A committee of the nonpartisan Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions last year recommended suspending the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission from its membership.",
      "It sustained complaints alleging a lack of independence, inability to effectively address human rights, the lack of cooperation with civil society and with the international human rights system, and the selection and appointment of its commissioners after the military takeover. The accreditation committee said that information provided by the Myanmar agency didn't change its findings.",
      "U.N. and other experts have said Myanmar\u2019s judiciary likewise is under the influence of the ruling military.",
      "Sai Zaw Thaike, 41, was arrested in May 2023, in the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe while reporting the damage caused by Cyclone Mocha, the country\u2019s most destructive storm in at least a decade.",
      "He was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a military tribunal after being convicted of charges under the Telecommunications Law, the Natural Disaster Management Law and statutes covering sedition and incitement for allegedly causing fear and spreading false news.",
      "Swe Win said that Sai Zaw Thaike was physically beaten, tortured and harassed, including by being forced to carry pots of human feces, for at least two weeks after a visit by officials from the Myanmar\u2019s National Human Rights Commission earlier this year.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s junta must identify and hold to account those responsible for assaulting journalist Sai Zaw Thaike,\u201d Shawn Crispin, senior Southeast Asia representative of the CPJ, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThis type of abuse is cruel and grotesque. Myanmar\u2019s military government must stop jailing and abusing journalists now.\u201d",
      "The military government hasn't responded to the allegations.",
      "At least 15 media outlets, including Myanmar Now, have had their media licenses revoked, and at least 172 journalists were arrested, up to 50 of whom remain detained, according to the local monitoring group Detained Journalists Information. Most of those still behind bars have been convicted under broadly defined security laws.",
      "The AP couldn't verify details on the allegations of human rights abuses in Insein prison. The prison has been notorious for decades for holding political prisoners under various military governments.",
      "According to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors deaths and arrests, security forces have arrested 28,693 people since the army takeover, with 21,937 remaining in custody.",
      "Myanmar Now reported that two other political prisoners had also suffered mental and physical damage after being tortured following visits by the human rights commissioners, including Thet Hnin Aung, a secretary-general of the Myanmar Industries Craft and Service Trade Union Federation, who was arrested in 2021 and again on his release in 2023 on political charges."

      "But since Assad's fall, Maaloula's Christians said some of those people have returned and carried out acts of vengeance including looting and vandalism. No one has been arrested.",
      "Christians say they have lived in peace with local Muslims and that the perpetrators are unfairly targeting them for what Assad did.",
      "\u201cThere are no guarantees,\u201d the priest, Ghazal, said. \u201cWhat we have to do is to try to reduce these incidents from happening.\u201d",

      "Sameera Thabet was among many residents who fled that night to Damascus. \u201cWe were living in fear, wondering if we were going to get slaughtered again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the next day, we came back after we heard that our houses were being looted.\u201d",
      "Already, the war had left bullet holes in religious symbols and artifacts. Paintings and mosaics of Jesus and other Christian figures had been damaged and defaced.",
      "Now residents and clergymen hope that Syria\u2019s new leaders will protect them and their efforts to pass down Christian tradition and the Aramaic language. Many people who had fled the town have not returned.",
      "Maaloula's church officials have asked al-Sharaa's government for more security. In late December, some security forces came from the capital during the Christmas holiday to protect the Christians who decorated homes and lit a tree in the town square.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t stay long. They came for two or three days then left,\" a dejected-looking Ghazal said. \"But our voices were heard.\u201d",

      "Bargeel said he's trying to look to the future. He wants to encourage more people, especially children, to learn Aramaic or become more fluent.",
      "\u201cThe moment a child is a born, the Aramaic language would be spoken at home.\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we started going to school as children, we didn\u2019t know Arabic.\u201d Now the language is mainly taught at home and is spoken more widely by older generations.",
      "Though the town is largely empty, remaining residents try to carry on.",
      "The Christmas tree still stood in the square. A few children fed stray dogs and cats loitering by a bakery.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 40,000 Palestinians driven from their homes by Israel's month-long offensive in the West Bank have scattered across nearby villages and towns, trying to find shelter",
      "JENIN, West Bank -- When Israeli snipers took positions in her neighborhood, Haleemeh Zawaydeh knew her family needed to leave quickly. As the snipers' gunfire rang out, the 63-year-old matriarch said there was no time to pack as she and 14 other family members fled on foot.",
      "The invasion of Jenin was faster than past Israeli assaults, she said. And, now, like some 37,000 other Palestinians the U.N. estimates have been driven out by a month-old offensive against militant groups in the occupied West Bank, Zawaydeh and her family are waiting to return to the place they\u2019ve long called home.",
      "But it's unclear if Israel will let them. Israel\u2019s assault has mostly emptied four refugee camps \u2014 sites that originated to house Palestinians driven from homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation and have since grown into densely built up towns or neighborhoods.",
      "Across the four camps, troops have ripped up roads and destroyed buildings, infrastructure, and water and electricity lines. The Israeli defense minister said Monday that troops were preparing to stay for a year and would prevent Palestinians from returning.",
      "That leaves thousands who hail from among the poorest areas of the West Bank in dire straits as many are forced to rent temporary housing in neighboring villages. OCHA, the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian agency, said there is an \u201curgent need for cash assistance\u201d for 4,000 families to meet rent needs.",
      "Zawaydeh said she was safe now at her shelter outside Jenin, but not at ease.",
      "\u201cI was born and raised in the camp, and now I have grown up and I still live in the camp,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no place that can replace the camp.\u201d",
      "Many Palestinians displaced from their West Bank homes are renting temporary housing or relying on friends or family to take them in. Some are staying in university dorms, others in makeshift shelters. Help is limited: The Palestinian Authority is strapped for cash, and the main U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known by the acronym UNRWA, has been handicapped by Israeli legislation.",
      "\u201cThe West Bank has never seen large-scale forced displacement of the level we\u2019re seeing now\" since 1967, said Roland Friedrich, the West Bank field director for UNRWA. During the 1967 Mideast War, some 250,000 Palestinians were forced from the West Bank when Israel seized the territory along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.",
      "After announcing a widespread crackdown against West Bank militants on Jan. 21 \u2014 just two days after it began a ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza \u2014 Israeli forces descended on Jenin camp, as they have dozens of times since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. But unlike past operations, Israeli forces also pushed deeper and more forcefully into several other nearby camps known as bastions of militant groups, including Tulkarem, Far\u2019a and Nur Shams.",
      "Israel's military says it has engaged in fierce battles with Palestinian militants inside the camps, which are now mainly emptied of their civilian populations.",
      "The dispersals are stirring bitter memories of the 1948 war over Israel\u2019s creation, when some 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from or fled their homes in what's now Israel. Forcible population transfers are banned under international law, and, if implemented as a policy, could be a war crime, rights groups say.",
      "The emptying of the West Bank camps comes as Israel\u2019s government and military have embraced U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for pushing out the population of the Gaza Strip permanently.",
      "In Nur Shams, a smaller refugee camp with a population of roughly 13,700, a number of displaced people returned Wednesday to clear what possessions they could from their homes after learning the Israeli military had slated them for demolition. Palestinians said the military puts out maps of intended demolitions in the camps. Asked the reasons for the demolitions, the military said it could not discuss operational plans.",
      "Mohammed Abdullah took advantage of the brief access to visit the grave of his son, Ali, who he said was killed by Israeli troops during a previous incursion into the camp. He hadn\u2019t been able to visit since being forced out two weeks ago.",
      "Abdullah then packed up his family\u2019s things from his home. No one can take everything, he said. \u201cEvery person has memories in his home, in his neighborhood, in the streets.\u201d",
      "The damage to the camps has been extensive. In Jenin camp, troops have demolished over 100 homes, Friedrich said. In Tulkarem camp, they have destroyed about 100 housing units and at least 300 commercial shops and set fire to at least 10 homes, according to the local Awda community center.",
      "At a charity for helping the blind in Jenin, converted into a shelter for those driven from the camp, barefoot children swung from monkey bars while their parents smoked cigarettes and looked on.",
      "Some 85 people from 23 families have taken up at the shelter. Rooms have been turned into separate dorms for men and women and children. Some have beds, others have mats on the floor. The charity relies on donations to feed its new residents.",
      "Facing mounting financial pressure and worried for their homes, many families have tried to return to the camps only to be blocked by the military.",
      "\u201cEvery day, we try to go back to the camp, hoping to enter, but they prevent us,\u201d said Nazmi Turkman, 53, who fled Jenin camp a month ago. \u201cThey\u2019ve set up checkpoints, placed tanks, and stationed soldiers. Even drones are flying around the people.\"",
      "\"God willing, we will return soon,\u201d he said. But he said he has no idea if his home still stands.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, the body charged with administering affairs in pockets of the West Bank where the camps lie, has denounced the wave of displacement. It says it has dispatched over 16 trucks of aid and sent funds to first responders.",
      "But its ability to help is limited. It has been left cash-strapped by the war, with Israel for months holding up tax revenues it needs to pay its workers. It is also largely detested across the territory, especially in the refugee camps, where it is seen as a tool of Israeli authorities.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening in the West Bank is a continuation of what the Israeli authorities did in the Gaza Strip,\u201d said Nabil Abu Redeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. \u201cWhat is happening will only lead to escalation, the repercussions of which will be felt throughout the region.\u201d",
      "UNRWA, too, is hampered. In the past, it could coordinate evacuations with the Israeli military. But new Israeli laws ban any interaction between Israeli authorities and the agency, making it difficult to evacuate people or ascertain when they will be allowed back, Friedrich said.",
      "On Tuesday, a small group of displaced men gathered outside Tulkarem camp, holding signs reading \u201cThe right of return is sacred \u2013 No to displacement.\u201d",
      "Nihad al-Shaweesh, head of a local political council for Nur Shams camp, said they were there to \u201ctell the whole world and all parties that we will not accept displacement.\u201d"

      "BERLIN -- Negotiators from German election winner Friedrich Merz's conservative bloc and the center-left Social Democrats started exploratory talks Friday on a possible coalition government, but were tightlipped on the details as they launched what could be a complicated process.",
      "Merz's Union bloc, which has led the opposition since 2021, won Sunday's election, in which the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany took second place.",
      "The only plausible choice of coalition partner for the Union \u2014 which like other mainstream parties rules out working with Alternative for Germany \u2014 is the Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. They slumped to third place and their worst post-World War II result in a German parliamentary election on Sunday.",
      "Between them, the Union and Social Democrats have 328 seats in the newly elected 630-seat parliament.",
      "In a brief statement after a first round of talks on Friday, the two sides said the discussions \u201cbegan in an open and constructive atmosphere.\u201d They said that Finance Minister J\u00f6rg Kukies offered an overview of Germany's budget situation and upcoming talks will discuss \u201cthe challenges.\u201d",
      "Another round will be held next week, according to the statement, which gave no specific date. At some point, negotiators will have to decide whether to move on to formal coalition talks.",
      "The possible partners will have to reconcile contrasting proposals for revitalizing the economy, which has shrunk for the past two years, and for curbing irregular migration \u2014 an issue that Merz pushed hard during the election campaign. They will also need to overcome distrust generated during the campaign.",
      "Merz has said he hopes to do a deal by Easter. That may be an optimistic timeframe, although other recent governments have been in place within two or three months of an election.",
      "There is no deadline for forming a government, and the record is much longer. After the 2017 election, it was nearly six months before lawmakers elected then-Chancellor Angela Merkel for her fourth and final term."

      "The mass mobilization, led by relatives of the 57 people killed, has been fueled by public resentment against the conservative government\u2019s perceived inaction. Critics of the government say that politicians should be held accountable for failures that led up to the crash, but so far only rail officials have charged with any crimes.",
      "The Feb. 28, 2023, disaster in Tempe \u2013 where a passenger train collided head-on with an oncoming freight train \u2013 was Greece\u2019s worst railway accident. The fiery crash also left dozens injured and exposed deficiencies in the country\u2019s transportation infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe full truth must come to light, and those responsible, no matter how high their position, must be held accountable,\u201d said Yannis Panagopoulos, president of the General Confederation of Greek Workers, the country\u2019s largest labor union, which has backed Friday\u2019s strike.",
      "\u201cLet us all take to the streets, expressing the outrage and demands of the overwhelming majority of the Greek people,\u201d he said.",

Private businesses and public services have also been affected, with many stores in Athens closed, leaving messages of solidarity for the victims\u2019 families in front windows.",
      "Demonstrations are planned in more than 300 cities and towns in Greece and abroad, with the parliament building in central Athens poised as the focal point. More than 5,000 police officers are being deployed in the capital to manage crowds and potential unrest.",

Opposition leaders, who are struggling to gain traction, are weighing whether to put forward a censure motion.",

      "A long-awaited report on the investigation into the Tempe crash, released Thursday, blamed human error, outdated infrastructure and major systemic failures for the head-on collision.",
      "The aftermath of the crash was marked by scenes of chaos, with surviving passengers describing tumbling carriages, fires and smashed windows as they scrambled to escape.",
      "It was followed by the gruesome task of victim recovery and identification as many bodies were severely burned or dismembered. Funerals were held across numerous communities throughout Greece, many streamed or broadcast live, turning private grief into a shared national experience.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has landed back in Britain with the satisfaction of a tricky mission not quite accomplished, but off to a flying start",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prime Minister Keir Starmer wore a broad smile aboard the plane home from Washington. He landed back in Britain on Friday with the satisfaction of a tricky mission not quite accomplished, but off to a flying start.",
      "Starmer\u2019s goals for his trip were to persuade President Donald Trump to provide Ukraine with security guarantees in any peace deal and head off duties on British goods while pursuing a rapport with an unpredictable U.S. leader who is the center-left prime minister\u2019s opposite in temperament and political outlook.",
      "On the personal front, he appeared to be remarkably successful. Whether that will bolster U.S. support for Kyiv or spare the U.K. from tariffs, only time will tell.",
      "Welcoming Starmer in the Oval Office at the White House, a relaxed-looking Trump was generous. He called Britain's leader \u201ca special man\u201d and said the two get along \u201cfamously.\u201d",
      "Sitting alongside the president in matching chairs, Starmer didn\u2019t get to say much \u2014 but he also didn't have any awkward moments.",
      "At a news conference later, the British leader laid on the charm, praising Trump for returning a bust of Winston Churchill \u2014 removed during the Obama and Biden administrations \u2014 to its \u201crightful place\u201d in the Oval Office.",
      "He even compared himself to Trump, saying that although \u201cwe are from different political traditions. \u2026 We\u2019re both in a hurry to get things done.\u201d",
      "Months of work went into preparing Starmer for this crucial meeting, with British officials strategizing how to strike the right balance of friendship, flattery and frankness.",
      "Starmer walked the line well \u2014 largely sticking to accentuating the positive, while occasionally pushing back. He thanked the president for creating a \u201cmoment of tremendous opportunity\u201d to end the war in Ukraine \u2014 skipping over concerns in Kyiv and other European capitals that Trump is pursuing warmer ties with Russia at the expense of old allies.",
      "Starmer said Trump has made a \u201chistoric peace agreement\u201d possible \u2014 though he cautioned that it \u201ccan\u2019t be peace that rewards the aggressor,\u201d pushing back on Trump\u2019s reluctance to blame Russia for starting the war.",
      "The British press showed rare unity in declaring the trip a success. \u201cCharmer Starmer pulls off diplomatic win in White House,\u201d said the front page of the i newspaper, which prides itself on its neutrality.",
      "\u201cWhat an unlikely bromance!\u201d said the right-leaning Daily Mail beside a photo of the two men laughing together.",
      "There were hints Starmer may have nudged Trump\u2019s thinking, or at least his language, on Ukraine. Trump said he had \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the democratically elected leader whom he recently called a dictator.",
      "The American president said a deal to end the war could come soon, but appeared to offer little on Starmer\u2019s request for U.S. security guarantees to underpin a ceasefire agreement. Britain and France are leading efforts to form a European-led military force to safeguard peace in Ukraine, but argue it can only work with the \u201cbackstop\u201d of U.S. military might in case of breaches.",
      "Trump said a deal he is due to sign with Zelenskyy on Friday, giving the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s critical minerals, was in itself a security guarantee, because it would bring \u201ca lot\u201d of Americans to work in Ukraine.",
      "He expressed confidence Russian President Vladimir Putin would keep his word; Starmer pointed out that the leader has often broken promises.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Trump is willing to offer more to Ukraine, though he suggested a deal could see some land seized by Russia returned to Kyiv\u2019s control. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see if we can get it back,\u201d he said.",
      "That struck a different note from his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who recently suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia.",
      "Starmer is due to debrief Zelenskyy and European allies about his trip at a meeting in London on Sunday.",
      "On the economy, Trump suggested the U.S. and Britain could soon strike a trade deal where the tariffs he has imposed or threatened on other countries \u201cwon\u2019t be necessary.\u201d",
      "But he offered no promises, saying only that Starmer tried hard to persuade him.",
      "\u201cYou are a very tough negotiator,\u201d he told the prime minister. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like that, but that\u2019s OK.\u201d",
      "Starmer specified that the agreement in the works is \u201ca new economic deal with advanced technology at its core.\u201d",
      "Britain aspires to be the third-biggest world power in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technology, after the U.S. and China. Starmer has moved to align Britain with the U.S. over the European Union on AI. He said that \u201cinstead of over-regulating these new technologies, we\u2019re seizing the opportunities that they offer.\u201d",
      "But his government, along with other European countries, has been criticized by U.S. Vice President JD Vance for restrictions on online discourse that ask tech companies to remove offending or illegal content.",

      "Starmer\u2019s trump card in his presidential charm offensive was royalty. In the Oval Office he presented the president with an envelope containing \u2014 on thick, expensive paper \u2014 a letter from King Charles III.",

      "Ethan Hertweck, a 21-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran who was killed while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, has been honored with a funeral service in Kyiv attended by family and friends",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A funeral service was held in Kyiv on Friday for a U.S. Marine Corps veteran killed while serving alongside Ukrainian forces. Family and friends said 21-year-old Ethan Hertweck had given his life fighting for freedom.",
      "Hertweck, from California, traveled to Ukraine soon after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022, initially assisting some of the millions of women and children who were fleeing the country in the earliest days of the war.",
      "After returning to the United States for several months, he returned to Ukraine to receive a combat medical license, and trained Ukrainian troops before himself joining a combat unit as a medic.",
      "In December 2023 he was guarding a military bunker in the eastern industrial region of the Donbas when Russian forces overtook his unit\u2019s position. When one of his unit was wounded, Hertweck attempted to drag him back to the safety of the bunker but was hit by gunfire in the process. He died soon after.",
      "At the funeral service in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Square, Hertweck's mother, father, sister and brother were presented with Ukrainian and U.S. flags as part of a military honors ceremony.",
      "Leslie Hertweck told those gathered that her son had died in a \u201cfight for freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was taken too young and he died a true hero,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cI\u2019m a very proud mom of what he did, that he came here for your people, for the country of Ukraine, to fight for freedom. And that\u2019s what Ethan stood for, was freedom.\u201d",
      "She described her son as \u201cstubborn, he was strong, he was serious. But he loved and had a soft heart.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know that we will miss him. But we will see you in heaven, Ethan, as you\u2019re with my mom and all those who\u2019ve gone before us,\u201d she said. \u201cSlava Ukraini.\u201d",
      "Hertweck was initially classified as missing in action and his family and fellow servicemen worked for months to retrieve his remains, which were believed to be behind Russian lines after the territory near the city of Avdiivka was captured by Moscow\u2019s forces.",
      "Finally, in December 2024, his body was part of a swap between the Ukrainian and Russian militaries. With the assistance of the RT Weatherman Foundation, a group that provides support and legal aid to families of soldiers killed in Ukraine, he was identified by his DNA.",
      "His family plans to repatriate him to the United States and lay him to rest in his native California.",
      "Jay Andrus, 25, a U.S. Marine veteran who trained in Ukraine with Hertweck, said the period his friend was listed as missing was difficult for family and friends to bear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good that we got his remains back because it kind of haunts you knowing that your friend is out there in the dirt and you don\u2019t know where he is,\" Andrus said. \u201cHe\u2019s back and he\u2019s going home, like every Marine should.\u201d",
      "He added that Hertweck, like so many foreign soldiers that have fought for Ukraine during the war, \"genuinely, really wanted to help people.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear as day: a country is being invaded, innocent people are dying, women and children,\u201d Andrus said. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to sit there with the training and the lifestyle that you\u2019re used to, watching the news and do nothing about it? I understand why (Hertweck) came, that\u2019s the reason why I came too.\u201d"

      "Pope Francis has reached the two-week mark in his recovery from pneumonia amid a guarded sense of optimism",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis reached the two-week mark recovery from pneumonia Friday as doctors suggested he had overcome the most critical phase of the infection while holding out on declaring him out of danger entirely.",
      "The Vatican\u2019s early Friday update also suggested a level of normalcy and routine as the 88-year-old pope continues recovering at Rome's Gemelli Hospital. \u201cAs in past days, the night was tranquil and the pope now is resting.\u201d",
      "In their Thursday evening bulletin, doctors said Francis\u2019 clinical condition had confirmed that he was improving. He was alternating the high-flow supplemental oxygen he had been receiving by a nasal tube with a mask in a sign of improved respiratory function. Additionally, he left his hospital room to go to his nearby private chapel to pray, while continuing with respiratory physiotherapy and work, the Vatican said.",
      "For the second day in a row, doctors avoided saying Francis was in critical condition, suggesting he had overcome the most acute phase of the infection. But given the complexity of his lung infection, they said \u201cfurther days of clinical stability are needed\u201d before they revise their prognosis officially and say he is out of danger.",
      "Francis has been at Gemelli Hospital since Feb. 14 after his bronchitis worsened.",
      "He has shown steady, albeit slight improvements since a respiratory crisis and kidney trouble over the weekend sparked fears for his life. The improvements beat back speculation of an imminent death, resignation or a conclave and signaled that he was still very much in charge.",
      "In Mexico City, a few dozen people gathered Thursday night at the cathedral to pray for Francis\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cHe is like part of the family,\u201d said Araceli Guti\u00e9rrez, who treasures the time she saw the pope during his trip to the country of nearly 100 million Catholics in 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s why we feel so concerned for him.\u201d",
      "Mar\u00eda Teresa S\u00e1nchez, who was visiting from Colombia with her sister, said that she has always felt close to Francis -- the first Latin American pope.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a relative within the higher-ups, with God,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has done so much for religion; he\u2019s such a humble person.\u201d",
      "Despite his improvements, Francis\u2019 near-term upcoming calendar of events was being changed: The Vatican cancelled a Holy Year audience scheduled for Saturday, and it remained to be seen if Francis would skip his Sunday noon blessing for the third week in a row. Ash Wednesday next week starts the Lenten season leading up to Holy Week and Easter, which this year falls on April 20.",
      "In past years, when Francis has battled bronchitis and influenza in winter, he curbed his participation in Ash Wednesday and Holy Week events, which call for the pope to be outdoors in the cold leading services, participating in processions and presiding over prayers in the solemn period in which the faithful commemorate Christ\u2019s crucifixion and resurrection.",
      "Beyond that, Francis has a few major events coming up that he presumably would hope to keep if well enough. On April 27, he is due to canonize Carlo Acutis, considered to be the first millennial and  digital-era saint. The Vatican considers the Italian teenager, who died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, an inspiration for young Catholics.",
      "Another important appointment is the May 24 commemoration of the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council. The spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians, Patriarch Bartholomew I, has invited Francis to join him in Iznik, Turkey, to commemorate the anniversary, which he has called an important sign of reconciliation between the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Before he got sick, Francis said he hoped to go, though the Vatican hasn\u2019t confirmed the trip.",

      "MIRAMAR, Panama -- Officials in Costa Rica and Panama are confiscating migrants\u2019 passports and cellphones, denying them access to legal services and moving them between remote outposts as they wrestle with the logistics of a suddenly reversed migration flow.",
      "The restrictions and lack of transparency are drawing criticism from human rights observers and generating increasingly testy responses from officials, who say their actions are aimed at protecting the migrants from human traffickers.",
      "Both countries have received hundreds of deportees from various nations sent by the United States as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration tries to accelerate deportations. At the same time, thousands of migrants shut out of the U.S. have started moving south through Central America \u2013 Panama recorded 2,200 so far in February.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a reflection of current United States immigration policy,\u201d said Harold Villegas-Rom\u00e1n, a political science professor and refugee expert at the University of Costa Rica. \u201cThere is no focus on human rights, there is only focus on control and security. Everything is very murky, and not transparent.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. sent 299 deportees from mostly Asian countries to Panama. Those who were willing to return to their countries \u2013 about 150 to date -- were put on planes with the assistance of United Nations agencies and paid for by the U.S.",
      "Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez, Panama\u2019s deputy foreign minister, said Thursday a small number are in contact with international organizations and the U.N. Refugee Agency as they weigh whether to seek asylum in Panama.",
      "\u201cNone of them wants to stay in Panama. They want to go to the U.S.,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Washington. \u201cWe cannot give them green cards, but we can get them back home and for a short period of time provide them with medical and psychological support as well as housing.\u201d",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s threats to retake control of the Panama Canal, he said Panama had not acted under U.S. pressure. \u201cThis is in Panama\u2019s national interest. We are a friend of the U.S. and want to work with them to send a signal of deterrence.\u201d",
      "Ruiz-Hernandez said some of the deportees remaining in Panama would be given the option of staying at a shelter originally set up to handle the large number of migrants moving north through the Darien Gap.",
      "One Chinese deportee currently detained in the camp, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid repercussions, said she wasn\u2019t given a choice.",
      "She was deported to Panama without knowing where they were being sent, without signing deportation documents in the U.S. and without clarity of how long they would be there. She was among the deportees who were moved from a Panama City hotel where some held up signs to their windows asking for help to a remote camp in the Darien region.",
      "Speaking to the AP over messages on a cellphone she kept hidden, she said authorities confiscated others\u2019 phones and offered them no legal assistance. Others have said they\u2019ve been unable to contact their lawyers.",
      "\u201cThis deprived us of our legal process,\u201d she said.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, asked about the lack of access to legal services on Thursday, questioned the idea that migrants would even have lawyers.",
      "\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like a coincidence that those poor people have lawyers in Panama?\u201d Mulino said.",
      "Costa Rica and Panama have so far denied press access to facilities where they are holding migrants. Panama had initially invited journalists to the Darien this week, but ultimately canceled the visit.",
      "\u201cPanama cannot end up becoming a black hole for deported migrants,\u201d said Juan Pappier, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in the Americas. \u201cMigrants have the right to communicate with their families, to seek lawyers and Panama must guarantee transparency about the situation in which they find themselves.\u201d",
      "Costa Rica has faced similar criticisms from the country\u2019s independent human rights entity, which has raised alarm over \u201cfailures\u201d by authorities to guarantee proper conditions for deportees arriving. The Ombudsman\u2019s Office, said that migrants were also stripped of their passports and other documents, and were not informed about what was happening or where they were going.",
      "Panama and Costa Rica, long transit countries for people migrating north, have scrambled to address the new flow of migrants going south and organize the flow.",
      "Kimberlyn Pereira, a 27-year-old Venezuelan traveling with her husband and 4-year-old son was among them.",
      "Pereira had waited months for an asylum appointment in Mexico after crossing the perilous Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama and traveling up through Central America. But after Trump took office and closed legal pathways to the U.S., she gave up and decided to go home, despite Venezuela\u2019s ongoing crises.",
      "But after a week of being held in a Costa Rican detention facility near the Panamanian border she expressed \u201chopelessness.\u201d",
      "Officials there had told them they would be flown to C\u00facuta, a Colombian city near the Venezuelan border. But they were loaded onto buses and driven to this Panamanian port on the Caribbean sea.",
      "\u201cWe do feel a little more protected. They\u2019ve given us food. My only concern is the confusion. This \u2018Come here, now go over there, get in this,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "While she and other migrants spoke to an AP journalist in a public place, Panamanian immigration authorities grew visibly upset and loaded nearly 200 migrants back on buses to drive them to a nearby building. When journalists attempted to follow them, immigration officials temporarily stopped on the side of the road in an attempt to keep them from following.",
      "Panamanian authorities declined to comment on the incident, but after voicing press freedom concerns, the journalists were allowed to catch up to the migrants.",
      "Before dawn Thursday, Pereira and other migrants boarded wooden boats that carried them to near the Colombia-Panama border where they planned to continue their journey. They paid up to $200 each for the ride.",

      "On Tuesday, Starmer said the government would raise U.K. defense spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2027 from the current 2.3%, saying Europe is in a new era of insecurity that requires a \u201cgenerational response.\u201d The increase would be funded by a reduction in the aid budget from 0.5% of GDP to 0.3%.",
      "The move, which drew support from U.S. President Donald Trump, was widely criticized by aid agencies, who said it not only harmed some of the world's poorest people but also reduced Britain's soft power."

      "The outbreaks in two distant villages in Congo\u2019s Equateur province began on Jan. 21 and include 419 cases and 53 deaths. Health officials still do not know the cause, or whether the cases in the two villages, which are separated by more than 120 miles (190 kilometers), are related. It\u2019s also unclear how the diseases are spreading, including whether they are spreading between people.",
      "The first victims in one of the villages were children who ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said this week. More infections were found in the other village, where at least some of the patients have malaria.",
      "Illnesses have been clustered in two remote villages in different health zones of Equateur province, which is 400 miles (640 kilometers) from Kinshasa.",
      "The first outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours. More than two weeks later a second and larger outbreak was recorded in the village of Bomate, where more than 400 people have been sickened. According to WHO's Africa office, no links have been established between the cases in the two villages.",
      "Dr. Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center, and one of the government experts deployed to respond to the outbreak, says the situations in the two villages are somewhat different.",
      "\u201cThe first one with a lot of deaths, that we continue to investigate because it\u2019s an unusual situation, (and) in the second episode that we\u2019re dealing with, we see a lot of the cases of malaria,\u201d said Dr. Ngalebato.",
      "The WHO Africa office said the quick progression from sickness to death in Boloko is a key concern, along with the high number of deaths in Bomate.",
      "Congo\u2019s Ministry of Health said about 80% of the patients share similar symptoms including fever, chills, body aches and diarrhea.",
      "While these symptoms can be caused by many common infections, health officials initially feared the symptoms and the quick deaths of some of the victims could also be a sign of a hemorrhagic fever such as Ebola, which was also linked to an infected animal.",
      "However, Ebola and similar diseases including Marburg have been ruled out after more than a dozen samples were collected and tested in the capital of Kinshasa.",
      "The WHO said it is investigating a number of possible causes, including malaria, viral hemorrhagic fever, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever and meningitis.",
      "Congo\u2019s government says experts have been sent to the villages since Feb. 14, mainly to help investigate the cases and slow the spread.",
      "Ngalebato said patients have been responding to treatments that target the different symptoms.",
      "The remote location of the villages has hindered access to patients while the weak health care infrastructure has made it difficult to carry out surveillance and manage patients. Such challenges are common in disease outbreaks in Congo. In December, an unknown illness killed dozens.",
      "In the latest outbreaks, several victims died even before experts could even reach them, Ngalebato said.",
      "There needs to be an urgent action \u201cto accelerate laboratory investigations, improve case management and isolation capacities, and strengthen surveillance and risk communication,\u201d the WHO Africa office has said.",
      "The U.S. has been the largest bilateral donor to Congo\u2019s health sector and has supported the training of hundreds of field epidemiologists to help detect and control diseases across the vast country. The outbreaks were detected as the Trump administration put a freeze on foreign aid during a 90-day review.",
      "There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where people regularly eat wild animals. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.",

      "A court in Bosnia has sentenced separatist Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years because of his unconstitutional actions",
      "SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- A court in Bosnia on Wednesday sentenced Milorad Dodik, the pro-Russia Bosnian Serb president, to one year in prison and banned him from politics for six years over his separatist actions as tensions mount in the fragile Balkan state.",
      "The landmark ruling by the court in Sarajevo came after a yearlong trial against Dodik on charges that he disobeyed the top international envoy overseeing peace in the Balkan country. The judgment becomes final after the appeal process.",
      "The leader and his lawyers weren't in court during the sentencing. Dodik has said that he would disobey any conviction and threatened \u201cradical measures\u201d in response, including eventual secession of the Serb-run entity in Bosnia called Republika Srpska from the rest of the country.",
      "Dodik has repeatedly called for the separation of the Serb-run half of Bosnia to join it with neighboring Serbia, which prompted the United States and the United Kingdom to impose sanctions against him and his close allies. Dodik is also accused of corruption and pro-Russia policies.",
      "Dodik\u2019s separatist threats stoked fears in Bosnia, where a 1992-95 war left 100,000 people killed and displaced millions. The U.S.-sponsored Dayton Accords ended the war nearly three decades ago and created two regions, Republika Srpska and the Bosniak-Croat Federation.",
      "The two regions were given wide autonomy but kept some joint institutions, including the army, the top judiciary and tax administration. Bosnia also has a rotating three-member presidency made up of Bosniak, Serb and Croat members.",
      "Bosniak official Camil Durakovic said the verdict against Dodik showed that \u201cno individual is above the state and that everyone will be held accountable for their actions.\u201d",
      "Dodik was in the Bosnian Serb administrative capital Banja Luka, where thousands gathered Wednesday in his support.",
      "\u201cThey say I am guilty, but now people here will say why I am not guilty,\u201d Dodik told the crowd shortly after the verdict was announced. \u201cThere is no reason to worry. I have learned to deal with tougher situations. It is important that you are here.\u201d",
      "In neighboring Serbia, populist President Aleksandar Vucic called an urgent session of the national security council there.",
      "Dodik is unlikely to be sent to prison, because he enjoys the full support of Vucic, who can provide shelter to him in Belgrade. Dodik is also expected to appeal the conviction.",
      "Dodik told the crowd in Banja Luka that he spoke on the phone with Vucic and with Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom he called a friend. He invited Vucic to come to Banja Luka to discuss \u201cwhat we are going to do next.\u201d",
      "Dodik said the Bosnian Serb parliament will vote later Wednesday to reject the legal proceedings against him. Lawmakers will also approve several laws banning the work of central Bosnian legal institutions from the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, he said.",
      "Dodik has repeatedly clashed with top international envoy Christian Schmidt and declared his decisions illegal in Republika Srpska. The Dayton peace agreement envisages that the high representative can impose decisions and change laws in the country.",
      "The war in Bosnia erupted when the country\u2019s Serbs rebelled against the country\u2019s independence from the former Yugoslavia and moved to form a mini-state of their own with the aim of uniting it with neighboring Serbia."

      "The release of the decision followed a three-day hearing last October for the owners\u2019 company at the High Court in the city of Auckland where they appealed the charges laid by New Zealand's workplace health and safety regulator following the 2019 eruption of Whakaari, also known as White Island.",
      "The company, Whakaari Management \u2014 run by three brothers who own the active volcano on New Zealand's North Island \u2014 was ordered in March 2024 to pay millions of dollars in fines and restitutions to the victims of the eruption, who were mostly U.S. and Australian cruise ship passengers on a walking tour.",
      "Lawyers for the company filed an appeal against the criminal conviction the same month.",
      "The case hinged on whether Whakaari Management \u2014 which granted access to the volcano to tourists and scientific groups, collecting fees for permits \u2014 should have been in charge of safety at the volcano site under New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety laws. Anyone in charge of a workplace must ensure management of hazards and the safety of all there, including at entry and exit points.",
      "Survivors told the trial in emotional testimony during the company's 2023 trial that they had not been told the active volcano was dangerous when they paid to visit it. They were not supplied with protective equipment, and many were wearing clothing that made their horrific burns more damaging.",
      "In Friday's written ruling, Justice Simon Moore ruled the company did not have a duty under the relevant law to ensure that the walking tour workplace was without risks to health and safety. He agreed with the company's lawyers that the firm only granted access to the bare land to tourism business \u2014 and should not have been legally considered the entity that managed or controlled the workplace.",
      "The case had far-reaching implications and has already changed the laws governing New Zealand\u2019s adventure tourism industry, which is often based around outdoor thrills on or around the country\u2019s many natural hazards. Operators must now take all reasonable steps to inform customers of any serious risks.",
      "The lawyers for the company said during last October's hearing that if the conviction was allowed to stand, it would make other land owners reluctant to allow such activities to take place on their property \u2014 a suggestion rejected by the regulator."

      "A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A small group of foreign tourists has visited North Korea in the past week, making them the first international travelers to enter the country in five years except for a group of Russian tourists who went to the North last year.",
      "The latest trip indicates North Korea may be gearing up for a full resumption of its international tourism to bring in much-needed foreign currency to revive its struggling economy, experts say.",
      "The Beijing-based travel company Koryo Tours said it arranged a five-day trip from Feb. 20 to Feb. 24 for 13 international tourists to the northeastern North Korean border city of Rason, where the country\u2019s special economic zone is located.",
      "Koryo Tours General Manager Simon Cockerell said the travelers from the U.K., Canada, Greece, New Zealand, France, Germany, Austria, Australia and Italy crossed by land from China. He said that in Rason, they visited factories, shops, schools and the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the late grandfather and father of current leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "\u201cSince January of 2020, the country has been closed to all international tourists, and we are glad to have finally found an opening in the Rason area, in the far north of North Korea,\u201d Cockerell said.",
      "\u201cOur first tour has been and gone, and now more tourists on both group and private visits are going in, arranging trips,\u201d he added.",
      "After the pandemic began, North Korea quickly banned tourists, jetted out diplomats and severely curtailed border traffic in one of the world\u2019s most draconian COVID-19 restrictions. But since 2022, North Korea has been slowly easing curbs and reopening its borders.",
      "In February 2024, North Korea accepted about 100 Russian tourists, the first foreign nationals to visit the country for sightseeing. That surprised many observers, who thought the first post-pandemic tourists would come from China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner and major ally.",
      "A total of about 880 Russian tourists visited North Korea throughout 2024, South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry said, citing official Russian data. Chinese group tours to North Korea remain stalled.",
      "This signals how much North Korea and Russia have moved closer to each other as the North has supplied weapons and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine. Ties between North Korea and China cooled as China showed its reluctance to join a three-way, anti-U.S. alliance with North Korea and Russia, experts say.",
      "Before the pandemic, tourism was an easy, legitimate source for foreign currency for North Korea, one of the world\u2019s most sanctioned countries because of its nuclear program.",
      "North Korea is expected to open a massive tourism site on the east coast in June. In January when President Donald Trump boasted about his ties with Kim Jong Un, he said that \"I think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He\u2019s got a lot of shoreline.\u201d That likely refers to the eastern coast site.",
      "A return of Chinese tourists would be key to making North Korea's tourism industry lucrative because they represented more than 90% of total international tourists before the pandemic, said Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's intelligence agency. He said that in the past, up to 300,000 Chinese tourists visited North Korea annually.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has been heavily investing on tourism sites, but there have been not much domestic demand,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe can assess that North Korea now wants to resume international tourism to bring in many tourists from abroad.\u201d",
      "The restrictions that North Korea has typically imposed on foreign travelers \u2014 such as requirements that they move with local guides and the banning of photography at sensitive places \u2014 will likely hurt its efforts to develop tourism. Lee said that Rason, the eastern coast site and Pyongyang would be the places where North Korea feels it can easily monitor and control foreign tourists.",

      "Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Venezuelan migrants handed over to Mexico like it\u2019s a U.S. immigration detention facility. Families from Central Asia flown to Panama and Costa Rica to await voluntary repatriation to their countries. Venezuelans from Guantanamo Bay handed off on a Honduran tarmac and returned to Caracas.",
      "It all sends the unmistakable message that trying to get to the U.S. border is no longer worth it. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has laid the groundwork to reverse the region\u2019s migration flow. And while the numbers remain modest, an outline of how the U.S. hopes to overcome limited detention space as it gears up its deportation machine is emerging.",
      "In its first month, the Trump administration has reached deals with Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama to act as stopovers or destinations for migrants expelled from the U.S. It has brokered deals with Venezuela to pick up its people in Texas, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and Honduras.",
      "But none of the agreements have been detailed for the public, raising concerns about evading international protections for refugees and asylum-seekers. Adam Isacson, a researcher with the Washington-based human rights advocacy organization WOLA, suspects many were little more than improvised \u201chandshake deals.\u201d",
      "They were requests made while Trump threatened tariffs and to take back the Panama Canal. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio moved through the region while U.S. foreign aid was suspended, bestowing exemptions when merited.",
      "Trump made deals during his first presidency with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to take in asylum-seekers, though only Mexico and Guatemala actually received them.",
      "But the agreements in his second term are more varied, ranging from Honduras letting Venezuelans get off a U.S. plane and board a Venezuelan one in its territory last week, to El Salvador offering to imprison deportees \u2014 and even U.S. citizen prisoners.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re being much more ambitious now,\u201d Isacson said. \u201cThe idea of sending people to be warehoused like goods, to deport them to third countries wasn\u2019t an issue\u201d in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "The numbers remain relatively small, but images of deportees deplaning in shackles and deportees holding up signs asking for help in the Panama hotel where they\u2019re held are powerful.",
      "This is still a preliminary phase because Congress has not approved a new budget, Isacson said. \u201cWhile they\u2019re at that lowest level of resources they are doing all of the shock and awe possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea is to scare them.\u201d",
      "Now the migration flow that is visible is of deportations and migrants boarding boats in Panama to take them south to Colombia rather than migrants riding trains north through Mexico or massing at the U.S. border.",
      "In just a month, Mexico has received more than 3,300 foreign deportees, who advocates say were from at least seven nationalities.",
      "A number of them carried unusual U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement documents that read: \u201cReason for transfer: removal. Name of new facility (immigration): MEXICO.\u201d They appear to have nothing to do with the Remain in Mexico program from Trump\u2019s first term that made asylum-seekers wait out the U.S. process from Mexico.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum has said little about Mexico\u2019s participation other than highlighting her administration\u2019s willingness to cooperate. The U.S. Department of State has praised Mexico for receiving deportation flights and for returning migrants from elsewhere to their countries.",
      "Farther south the numbers are smaller, but the imagery has been stronger.",
      "Panama, where more than 500,000 migrants passed en route to the U.S. border in 2023, suddenly became a bridge this month for U.S. efforts to deport asylum seekers. Nearly 300 U.S. deportees from 10 mostly Asian countries were held in a Panama City hotel. Some put signs to their windows that read \u201cHelp\u201d and \u201cWe are not save (sic) in our country.\u201d",
      "About one-third of those in the hotel who refused to voluntarily return to their countries were then sent to a remote camp back in the very jungle they had probably crossed in the other direction. One deportee in the camp told The Associated Press they were not informed of their rights and weren't told how long they would be in the camp, which concerned her because of its poor conditions.",
      "Similar flights landed in Costa Rica last week and they were sent to a remote facility that had also previously received migrants headed north.",
      "In addition to those flights, 50 to 75 migrants are moving south through Costa Rica on their own daily, according to Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s vice minister of the interior.",
      "He raised the possibility of Panama and Colombia getting involved to organize boat trips south for migrants, but neither of those governments has publicly confirmed their involvement. Panama and Costa Rica say U.N. agencies are assisting with the repatriations and that the U.S. government is paying.",
      "The International Organization for Migration said that it was helping authorities provide basic services and facilitating voluntary repatriations \u201cwhen it is safe to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith the old flow (south to north) the situation is pretty under control,\u201d Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said Thursday. \u201cThat shows that now the problem is coming in the opposite direction and we hope that can be managed in an orderly fashion.\u201d",
      "Even with the involvement of U.N. agencies, concerns abound about vulnerable migrants being passed from country to country and even sent back to countries they fled.",
      "Advocates worry the U.S. may be using third countries to deport migrants from countries where the U.S. may not have diplomatic relations or strained ones, to get around constraints in international law that are supposed to prevent people from being sent back to places they would not be safe.",
      "Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental legal services organization in Mexico, said recently a flight carrying Venezuelans from the United States to Venezuela made a stop in Cancun. But IMUMI wasn\u2019t able to speak with the migrants aboard directly to know if they wanted to try to request asylum in Mexico while in the country\u2019s territory.",
      "Isacson said among the Venezuelans sent back to that country have been people who deserted the armed forces, who would now be in the hands of the military. The risks could be even more dire for some migrants from Iran and Afghanistan.",
      "The region\u2019s governments are understandably sensitive about appearing to be aiding in Trump\u2019s deportation efforts, but Isacson said transparency will better shield them from those criticisms.",

Residents in Goma, which was once a critical trade and humanitarian hub, say they are struggling on various fronts even as the rebels try to consolidate their administration and restart normal life.",
      "On the streets of Goma, which is close to the border with Rwanda, economic activities have largely slowed down since the M23 rebels took over on Jan. 28. Banks are still shut, basic services such as trade are slowly restarting and thousands displaced by the conflict are desperate for aid and temporary shelters.",
      "\u201cFinding food has become a real challenge,\u201d said Jeannette Safari, her face marked by exhaustion and fear.",
      "The 26-year-old mother of one is now making plans to flee to Burundi. Safari had been working as a civil servant, but with government offices still not running, making ends meet has been a struggle for thousands of government workers like her living where the M23 controls, she said.",
      "\u201cLife is cheaper there (in Burundi), and even though I don\u2019t know exactly how I\u2019ll manage, I\u2019ll make do,\u201d she said.",
      "The city and its environs had hosted more than 500,000 displaced people in addition to its population of 2 million, before the M23 rebels seized it last month in a major escalation of their yearslong fighting with government forces in the central African nation.",
      "With the support of around 4,000 troops from Rwanda, the rebels fought off overstretched and outnumbered Congolese forces \u2014 many of whom surrendered \u2014 and started to gain more territories, taking Bukavu, a second major city in the region. The expansion is unprecedented, unlike in 2012 when M23 captured Goma for days, and has raised the risks of regional warfare, analysts say.",
      "Although the rebels have agreed to talks that neighbors have pushed for, Congo's government accuses them of carrying out human rights abuses and using their campaign to advance the interests of Rwanda.",
      "The rebellion has meant that the devastated city, which used to be a key trade route, has struggled economically as schools and other social services haven't returned to normal levels.",
      "The M23 has tried to strengthen their grip on the city, pushing for social services like electricity and water supplies to return. But life is still far from normal, locals say, many of them living in fear and uncertainty about what could happen next.",
      "Roads that were once bustling with heavy traffic and shopping outlets are often deserted and heavily militarized with armed rebels at every corner.",
      "As the M23 advanced towards Goma in January, the number of residents fleeing to safety sharply grew from hundreds to thousands. By the time the city had fallen to the rebellion, hundreds of thousands of people who were already displaced by the conflict had fled once again, the U.N. said.",
      "Despite M23\u2019s promises to restart economic activities, commercial banks haven't resumed operations as the local branch of the Central Bank of Congo remains closed down.",
      "The bank closures have led to concerns that the rebels could seek alternative banking systems independent of the Congolese government\u2019s control, a major setback to regional efforts to get them to withdraw from the city.",
      "\u201cThe only solution to this crisis would be a rigorous management of available resources and the establishment of alternative financial structures such as microfinance institutions,\u201d said Deo Bengehya, a Goma-based professor of economic sciences.",
      "The prolonged suspension of banking activities could further weaken the local economy and squeeze the population, which is already struggling with job losses and price hikes, he added.",

      "The aim is to create new political space in a fiercely divisive dynastic political landscape. For decades, the country\u2019s politics have been dominated by two former prime ministers and archrivals \u2014 Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia.",
      "The announcement came Friday at a rally in front of Parliament in Dhaka, during which political reforms were promised for a country born in 1971 through a bloody war against Pakistan.",
      "Thousands of people, mainly youths, gathered to witness the moment. Critics of Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who heads the interim government, say the new party is nothing but a \u201cKing\u2019s Party\u201d blessed by him. But political analysts say the new platform might be able to break the decades-long traditional political power structure in the South Asian nation.",
      "The new party has been named the Jatiya Nagarik Party, or National Citizen Party.",
      "Nahid Islam, a 26-year-old prominent student leader, was named as the head of the party. Nine other officials \u2014 all of them student leaders who rose to prominence during the mass uprising in July and August \u2014 have been named to top positions, according to Bangladeshi media.",
      "A 151-member committee of the party was announced during the launch.",
      "Supporters say a party is needed to bring reforms to the country\u2019s political culture of nepotism, and to tackle corruption and lack of democratic practices.",
      "Islam announced that the party\u2019s mission is to dismantle \u201cconstitutional autocracy and adopt a new democratic constitution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must eliminate all possibilities of restoring constitutional autocracy. Now is the time to dream anew, to march forward, and to build a new Bangladesh,\u201d Islam said as he read out the declaration.",
      "He said that the mass uprising wasn't merely about ousting a government, but also about reshaping the entire political framework.",
      "The party is committed to fostering a political culture where \u201cunity prevails over division, justice replaces vengeance, and merit triumphs over dynastic politics,\u201d Islam said.",

      "Hasina\u2019s Awami League Party and its 13 other previous allies weren't invited to the launching ceremony. Yunus or other advisers from his interim Cabinet didn't attend the event. Foreign diplomats were also invited but diplomats from India and other major global powers weren't spotted at the rally.",
      "Islam and his colleagues have been campaigning for months for Hasina to be put on trial for hundreds of deaths during the July-August uprising. The student leaders involved in the new party have also talked fiercely against India, accusing the neighboring country of exhibiting hegemony over Bangladesh, drawing a sharp reaction from India.",
      "On Friday, a giant stage was installed on a major thoroughfare just in front of the Parliament building in Dhaka. The organizers said they expected up to 300,000 people during the party\u2019s launch. But witnesses said up to 50,000 attended the event.",
      "After the installation of the interim government, Yunus repeatedly said that he was appointed by the students who led the anti-Hasina uprising.",
      "It wasn't clear if Yunus had any direct role behind forming the new party, but many critics of Yunus said, mainly on social media, that the formation of the party is an effort to unveil a \u201cking\u2019s party.\u201d",

      "Hasina\u2019s Bangladesh Awami League party is under tremendous pressure after she fled to India and thousands of party leaders and activists have either left the country, gone into hiding or have been arrested. The student wing of Hasina\u2019s party has already been banned by the Yunus-led government, which has been struggling to stabilize the country's law and order situation since the ouster of Hasina."

      "A key price gauge declined last month, a sign that inflation may be cooling though stiff tariffs threatened by the White House threaten that progress",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumers cut back sharply on spending last month, the most since February 2021, even as inflation declined, though stiff tariffs threatened by the White House could disrupt that progress.",
      "Americans cut their spending by 0.2% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday, likely in part because of unseasonably cold weather. Yet the retreat may be hinting at more caution by consumers amid rising economic uncertainty.",
      "Inflation declined to 2.5% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.6% in December, the government said. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices dropped to 2.6%, the lowest since June, from 2.9%.",
      "One other bright spot in the report was that incomes jumped 0.9% in January from December, fueled in part by a large annual cost of living adjustment for Social Security beneficiaries.",
      "Inflation spiked in 2022 to its highest level in four decades, propelling President Donald Trump to the White House and causing the Federal Reserve to rapidly raise interest rates to tame prices. It has since fallen from a peak of 7.2%.",
      "Last month\u2019s decline could reassure Fed officials that inflation is still slowly cooling. The Fed prefers Friday\u2019s measure to the more widely-known consumer price index, which rose for the fourth straight month in January to 3%. Friday\u2019s gauge calculates inflation slightly differently: For example, it puts less weight on the costs of housing and used cars.",
      "Even so, the key question preoccupying many American consumers, investors, and business executives is whether Trump\u2019s extensive tariff proposals will push prices higher in the coming months. Trump said Thursday he will double his recently-announced tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%, and will impose 25% import taxes on Canada and Mexico next Tuesday. The three countries are the United States\u2019 top trading partners.",
      "Trump is also calling for widespread layoffs of federal workers, which could cause hundreds of thousands of job losses and potentially lift the unemployment rate.",
      "\u201cIncreased uncertainty surrounding trade, fiscal and regulatory policy is casting a shadow over the outlook,\u201d said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at accounting and consulting firm EY.",
      "Americans also likely cut back on their spending after a healthy winter holiday season that saw a surge in credit card debt in December, economists noted.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% in January from the previous month, matching December\u2019s 0.3% increase. Core prices rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% in December. If sustained, January\u2019s increases would keep inflation running above the Fed\u2019s target. The Fed pays more attention to core prices because they provide a better read of future inflation.",
      "A big concern right now is whether tariffs will push up inflation, or slow the economy, or \u2014 in a particularly toxic combination \u2014 both.",
      "A report from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Boston branch this month concluded that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with Trump\u2019s initial 10% import taxes on China, could lift core inflation by as much as 0.8 percentage points.",
      "The last time Trump imposed tariffs in 2018-19, inflation was largely unaffected \u2014 but those tariffs were on a much narrower range of goods. And the economy still slowed, prompting the Fed to cut interest rates.",
      "Worries about tariffs pushing prices higher have sent consumer confidence plunging, unwinding the modest gains that had occurred after the election. Americans are also expecting inflation to move higher in the coming months. That\u2019s a risky trend because if consumers and businesses expect higher prices, they may act in ways to lift inflation, such as accelerating their purchases and boosting demand."

      "The U.S. lobster industry continued a multiyear slide in catch last year",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- The U.S. lobster industry's catch keeps sliding as fishermen contend with the northward migration of the valuable crustaceans.",
      "The industry is based mostly in Maine, where lobsters are both a cultural signifier and the backbone of the coastal economy. The state's haul of lobsters has declined every year from 2021, when it was nearly 111 million pounds, to 2023, when it was less than 97 million pounds.",
      "That decline extended into 2024, when the haul was about 86.1 million pounds, according to data released by state regulators on Friday. That is the lowest figure in 15 years. A series of major storms that damaged waterfront communities and disrupted fisheries was a key factor in the reduced catch, officials said.",
      "Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, praised the industry for its perseverance.",
      "\u201cDuring a year shaped by unprecedented storms and damage to our working waterfronts, Maine\u2019s commercial fishermen, aquaculturists, and seafood dealers once again delivered a major economic benefit to our state,\u201d she said.",
      "Last year\u2019s catch was still historically high, as Maine fishermen never exceeded 80 million pounds prior to 2009. Hauls in the 2000s were typically between 50 million and 80 million pounds. Hauls in the mid-2010s were routinely above 120 million pounds.",
      "The fishery remained economically strong in 2024. Maine fishermen took home more than $528 million at the docks, and that was the highest total since 2021, state officials said. Demand for the product, one of the most expensive seafoods, remained high, and the price per pound was one of the highest on record.",
      "The state is meeting the challenges of climate change head-on, said Patrick Keliher, the commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. The governor has secured funding to \"help rebuild damaged coastal infrastructure, make it more resilient to the effects of climate change, and protect critically important waterfront access for those who make a living on the water,\u201d he said.",
      "But numerous environmental and economic challenges threaten the industry's future. One of the biggest is the decline in the number of baby lobsters settling off New England. The young lobsters have to take shelter and grow to legal size to sustain the future of the fishery. Scientists have said the lobster population is migrating north to cooler habitats as oceans warm.",
      "The Maine lobster industry is also linked to Canada\u2019s seafood industry and could be disrupted by new tariffs. Canadian fishermen harvest the same species of lobster as American fishermen, and much of the processing capacity for the seafood is in Canada. Tariffs are likely to increase prices on both sides of the border, members of the industry have said.",
      "Another major challenge is the possibility of new rules to protect critically endangered North Atlantic right whales, which are vulnerable to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Fishing groups have engaged in protracted court cases against the government over stricter fishing rules.",
      "Other states, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, also have lobster fishing industries, but Maine's is by far the largest, and the size of the Maine harvest gives a firm indication of the health of the American lobster industry at large. Maine accounted for about 78% of the country's total lobster haul in 2023."

      "Egg producers blame the ongoing bird flu outbreak for driving prices up to record highs",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Egg producers blame the bird flu outbreak for driving prices to record highs, but critics believe giant companies are taking advantage of their market dominance to profit handsomely at the expense of budget-conscious egg buyers.",
      "Advocacy groups, Democratic lawmakers and a Federal Trade Commission member are calling for a government investigation after egg prices spiked to a record average of $4.95 per dozen this month. The Trump administration did unveil a plan this week to combat bird flu, but how much that might ease egg prices \u2014 a key driver of inflation \u2014 remains to be seen.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump promised to lower food prices on \u2018Day One\u2019, but with egg prices skyrocketing out of control, he fired the workers charged with containing bird flu. Working families need relief now,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a statement.",
      "The industry, and most experts, squarely blame bird flu. More than 166 million birds have been slaughtered to contain the virus. Some 30 million egg layers have been wiped out just since January, significantly disrupting egg supplies. The Department of Agriculture's longstanding policy has been to kill entire flocks anytime the virus is found on a farm.",
      "As a result, the number of egg layers has dropped nationwide by about 12% from before the outbreak to 292 million birds, according to a Feb. 1 USDA estimate, but another 11 million egg layers have been killed since then, so it's likely worse. When prices spiked to $4.82 two years ago and prompted initial calls for price gouging probes, the flock was above 300 million.",
      "\u201cThis has nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. And I think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the reality,\u201d American Egg Board President Emily Metz said.",
      "\u201cOur farmers are in the fight of their lives, period, full stop. And they\u2019re doing everything they can to keep these birds safe,\" Metz said. \"This is a supply challenge. Due to bird flu. Nothing else.\u201d",
      "Farm Action suspects monopolistic behavior. The group that lobbies on behalf of smaller farmers, consumers and rural communities notes that egg production is only down about 4% from last year and some 7.57 billion table eggs were produced last month, yet some consumers are still finding egg shelves empty at their local grocery stores.",
      "\u201cDominant egg corporations are blaming avian flu for the price hikes that we\u2019re seeing. But while the egg supply has fallen only slightly, these companies profits have soared,\u201d said Angela Huffman, Farm Action's president. The Justice Department acknowledged receiving the group's letter calling for an investigation but declined to comment on it.",
      "The fact that a jury ruled in 2023 that major egg producers used various means to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products during the 2000s only adds to the doubts about their motives now.",
      "Retail egg prices had generally remained below $2 per dozen for years before this outbreak began. Prices have more than doubled since then, boosting profits for egg producers even as they deal with soaring costs.",
      "Most of the dominant producers are privately held companies and don't release their results. But the biggest, Cal-Maine Foods, which supplies about 20% of the nation's eggs, is public, and its profits increased dramatically. Cal-Maine reported a $219 million profit in the most recent quarter when its eggs sold for an average of $2.74 per dozen, up from just $1.2 million in the quarter just before this outbreak began in early 2022 when its eggs were selling for $1.37 per dozen.",
      "Sherman Miller, Cal-Maine\u2019s president and CEO, said in reporting the numbers that higher market prices \"have continued to rise this fiscal year as supply levels of shell eggs have been restricted due to recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.\u201d",
      "But he said Cal-Maine also sold significantly more eggs \u2014 some 330 million dozens, up from 288 million the year before \u2014 in the quarter because demand is so strong and Cal-Maine has made a number of acquisitions. Cal-Maine also suffered few outbreaks on its farms, outside of a couple facilities in Kansas and Texas. The Mississippi-based company didn't respond to calls from The Associated Press.",
      "Economists and analysts say the record egg prices aren't a sure sign of something nefarious, and short-term profits might only last until farms get hit. Once a flock is slaughtered, it can take as long as a year to clean a farm and raise new birds to egg-laying age. The USDA pays farmers for every bird killed, but it doesn't cover all the costs for farmers as they go without income.",
      "\u201cThe consumer, I think, will probably feel like they\u2019re getting the rough end of the stick. But I guarantee you, the farmers that are having to depopulate the barns, they\u2019re having a rougher time,\u201d CoBank analyst Brian Earnest said.",
      "Inflation in the costs of feed and fuel and labor have contributed to rising egg prices, and farmers have been investing in biosecurity measures to help keep the virus away. So production costs also appear to be at an all-time high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' producer price index.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t a case where they\u2019re taking the price up to gouge the market. It is the price is going up through auction at wholesale. And they\u2019re benefiting from higher prices because supplies are tight,\u201d University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said.",

      "President Donald Trump has made the raw materials of modern life a pillar of U.S. foreign policy",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- President Donald Trump is taking a step toward granting the U.S. mining industry\u2019s biggest wishes by singling out one metal as a focus of his domestic minerals policy: copper.",
      "From talk of acquiring Greenland and its vast mineral wealth to prodding Ukraine for minerals in exchange for help fending off Russia's invasion, Trump has made the raw materials of modern life a pillar of his foreign policy.",
      "An executive order Trump signed Tuesday calls for boosting the domestic copper industry by investigating the national security implications of imports and weighing tariffs as a response.",
      "\u201cThe United States has ample copper reserves, yet our smelting and refining capacity lags significantly behind global competitors,\u201d the order reads.",
      "It could mean a new day for U.S. copper mining, and new worries for environmental groups that are contesting proposals such as the stalled Twin Metals project in northern Minnesota's Boundary Waters, a lake-filled wilderness on the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "\u201cThe White House itself acknowledges that America has \u2018ample supplies\u2019 of copper. Sacrificing an irreplaceable national treasure for an insignificant amount of copper is reckless and unnecessary,\u201d Ingrid Lyons, executive director of the Save the Boundary Waters, said by email.",
      "Copper is at least as crucial as lithium and cobalt for rechargeable batteries and rare-earth elements for cellphones, LED lights and flat-screen TVs. Copper goes into the cords and transmission lines that plug gadgetry into power.",
      "\u201cCopper is, I think, the metal that is really the most critical because it is the electricity metal,\u201d said Debra Struhsacker, a mining industry policy consultant. \u201cThe electricity demand is, I think, going to stay. And copper is indispensable for that.\u201d",
      "U.S. copper use, imports and exports have fluctuated somewhat over the past two decades, according to the Copper Development Association, but a dearth of smelting compared with the amount mined domestically has remained a consistent theme.",
      "While the U.S. in 2024 mined an estimated 1.1 million tons (1 million metric tons) of copper and exported about a third of that in primarily unrefined form, it imported 810,000 tons (735,000 metric tons), nearly all of it refined, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Trump's executive order accurately refers to China as the world's leading refiner of copper, with over half the world's smelting capacity. China, however, does not directly factor into U.S. supplies. Two-thirds of U.S. imports of refined copper comes from Chile, which is the world's leading copper producer, with lesser amounts from Canada, Mexico and Peru.",
      "How much those numbers might change with rising copper demand to support construction of transmission lines and manufacturing of wind turbines and electric vehicles remains to be seen. Some predict global demand to double by 2030 and keep rising, notes the National Mining Association.",
      "Even before Trump's plan for copper, the association was encouraged by Trump executive orders promoting mining. One lifts government rules and regulations responsible for \u201cundue burdens\u201d on mining and mineral processing, calls for updating the U.S. Geological Survey's list of minerals deemed critical to the nation and backs efforts to find and mine new sources of those minerals.",
      "\u201cMade in America, America first, starts with American mining and American miners that supported this president across the country,\u201d National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan said.",
      "The mining association's top priorities include:",
      "\u2014 The planned $1.7 billion Twin Metals copper-nickel-cobalt mine that environmental groups contend poses an unacceptable risk to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota, the most visited federally designated wilderness area. The latest blow to the project came when a judge refused to reinstate mining leases.",
      "\u2014 The stalled $1 billion NewRange Copper Nickel mine, also in northeastern Minnesota, which developers look to redesign to make more environmentally and cost-efficient after a series of court and regulatory setbacks.",
      "\u2014 The contested Resolution Copper project at Oak Flat in central Arizona, which is believed to be the world's third-biggest deposit of copper ore and was the site of a battle between locals who want the mine for economic development and native Apache who consider the land sacred. An appeals court panel in 2024 refused to block a crucial land transfer for the mine.",
      "\u2014 Southern Arizona's proposed Copper World copper-molybdenum mine, formerly known as the Rosemont mine, which has been delayed by a court ruling that limited how mining companies can discard tailings on U.S. Forest Service land under the 1872 Mining Law.",
      "All four projects are led by non-U.S. companies including Toronto, Canada-based Hudbay Minerals Inc., developer of Copper World.",
      "The federal government should have a national strategy to protect the environment and public health by avoiding new terrain and increasing production at existing mines operating at less than full capacity, said Rob Peters, executive director of Save the Scenic Santa Ritas, a group opposing Copper World.",
      "\u201cThat would make sense, right? But there\u2019s nothing like that. Instead, it\u2019s sort of like the Wild West where companies \u2014 in our case here in Arizona, the majority of them foreign companies \u2014 just can come in. And the only decision-making process is the company figures out where they think they can make the most money,\u201d Peters said.",
      "Decades ago, Arizona copper made the U.S. the world's top producer. Now it ranks fifth.",
      "To Struhsacker, the industry consultant, lack of government coordination has stalled permits and stifled mine development. Trump's executive orders recognize the need \u201cto make permitting work again,\u201d she said."

      "NEW YORK -- For years, Ed Yaker, treasurer of a New York City co-op with nearly 1,500 units, and fellow board members have dealt with gas leaks. It can mean the gas at an entire building is shut off, leaving residents unable to use a stove for months until expensive repairs are made to gas lines.",
      "So Yaker was all in when he learned of a California startup called Copper that was manufacturing an electric stove and oven that could simply be plugged into a regular outlet. The sleek, standard four-burner electric induction stove runs on 120 volts, meaning there is no need to pay a licensed electrician thousands of dollars to rewire to 240 volts, which many electric stoves require.",
      "\u201cIn terms of, \u2018Is this the way to go?\u2019 It\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d Yaker said, demonstrating a quart of water that boiled in about two minutes. His apartment is full of books, many on energy and climate change, and the energy efficiency was a motivation, too.",
      "Then there are the health benefits of cooking with electricity. Gas stoves, which 47 million Americans use, release pollutants like nitrogen dioxide that has been linked to asthma and cancer-causing benzene.",
      "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t stand over the tailpipe of a car breathing in the exhaust from that car. And yet nearly 50 million households stand over a gas stove, breathing the same pollutants in their homes,\u201d said Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Stanford University and lead author on a study on pollution from gas cooking.",
      "\u201cI had a gas stove until I started this line of research. Watching pollutant levels rise almost immediately every time I turned a burner on, or my oven on, was enough to get me to switch\u201d to an electric stove, he said.",
      "Induction stoves are also a way to address the considerable amount of climate change that comes from buildings \u2014 emissions from cooking, heating and cooling living spaces and hot water.",
      "In the case of gas stoves, about half of the flame\u2019s heat escapes into the room. Electric stoves by comparison can be up to 80% efficient. Of those, induction stoves come out on top with up to 90% efficiency in part because they only heat where the surface contacts the pot.",
      "Just the presence of a gas stove in a home contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, even when it\u2019s not turned on. Jackson's team found gas stoves bleed methane \u2014 the main constituent of natural gas \u2014 when they\u2019re off, from loose fittings and at connections between the stove and wall. The climate impact of leaky stoves in U.S. homes was estimated to be comparable to carbon emissions from 500,000 gasoline-powered cars.",
      "The stove contains a battery that is smart, meaning it can charge up when electrical rates are low, allowing people to cook without incurring peak-rate electrical charges.",
      "The new Copper stoves are not cheap. Early adopters are relying on government incentives to defray the cost. When Yaker, who worked as a teacher and was a saver, bought his, it was $6,000 and a federal tax credit for clean energy appliances brought that down to $4,200.",
      "The manufacturer now has an agreement with the New York City Housing Authority to buy 10,000 stoves at a maximum price of $3,200 each, set to arrive in 2026.",
      "Eden Housing in Martinez, California, retrofit one of its 32-apartment buildings with Copper stoves using state and local programs. The affordable housing group plans to purchase more.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, it looks nice and it\u2019s easy to clean,\u201d said Jolene Cardoza, about the new appliance. Her adult daughter\u2019s asthma was irritated by her old gas stove when she would come over to bake and she\u2019s happy the Copper doesn\u2019t release pollutants.",
      "Other tenants found the transition to induction cooking more bumpy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like the way it cooks my food in the oven,\u201d said Monica Moore, who notices a difference in the texture of her cornbread. She is impressed with how quickly water boils, but misses cooking with a flame and said it was a hassle to switch out her pans with ones that are compatible with induction stoves.",
      "For Jackson, though, the change is important.",
      "\u201cI think shutting the gas off to our homes and electrifying our homes is one of the best things that we can control individually to reduce our personal greenhouse gas emissions. I think of cars and homes as the two places to start for reducing our greenhouse gas footprint,\u201d said Jackson.",

      "The original Gatwick project, which was rejected but then revised by planning inspectors, means that the final approval may be delayed by nine months.",
      "Under the new plan, Gatwick will have to ensure at least 50% of passengers traveling to and from the airport do so by public transport and take steps to mitigate noise.",
      "Gatwick, which is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of London and serves more than 40 million passengers a year, is the country's busiest single-runway airport, and second-busiest overall behind London's Heathrow Airport.",
      "Under the plan, Gatwick will have to move the current emergency runway 12 meters (39 feet) north away from the main runway in order to meet international safety standards. That would allow it to be used for departures of narrow-bodied planes such as Airbus A320s and Boeing 737s.",
      "The project, which will be funded privately, is expected to cost 2.2 billion pounds ($2.8 billion), could be completed by the end of the decade, if construction begins later this year.",
      "The expansion would allow it to cater for another 100,000 flights a year, taking capacity up to more than 380,000. It's projected to create 14,000 new jobs and generate 1 billion pounds ($1.26 billion) in annual economic benefits to the country.",
      "Gatwick, which is majority-owned by France-based VINCI Airports, has until April 24 to formally respond to the new proposals, while Alexander is expected to make a final decision shortly after that date, although a deadline has been extended to Oct. 27.",
      "Gatwick CEO Stewart Wingate welcomed Thursday's announcement, saying that the airport will \u201cengage fully\u201d in the extended process for a final decision.",
      "\u201cBy increasing resilience and capacity, we can support the U.K.\u2019s position as a leader in global connectivity and deliver substantial trade and economic growth in (southeast England) and more broadly,\u201d he said.",
      "Climate change activists, however, have railed against the new Labour government's provisional thumbs-up, which came just a few weeks after it gave its full backing to the construction of a third runway at London's Heathrow Airport, the country's busiest, as part of its drive to bolster the U.K.'s anemic economic growth over recent years. The government has made airport expansion a central plank of its growth plan.",
      "\u201cSuch a decision would be one that smacks of desperation, completely ignoring the solid evidence that increasing air travel won\u2019t drive economic growth,\u201d said Greenpeace U.K.\u2019s policy director, Doug Parr. \u201cThe only thing it\u2019s set to boost is air pollution, noise and climate emissions.\u201d"

      "A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A spike in demand for electricity from tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race is upending forecasts for natural gas-fired power in the U.S., as utilities reconsider it as a major new power source.",
      "That is not what many scientists and climate activists envisioned in the fight against climate change. And it is endangering progress on the greenhouse gas-reduction goals that scientists say are necessary to manage the damage from burning fossil fuels that warms the planet.",
      "Across the nation, tech companies are snapping up real estate and seeking new power projects to feed their energy-hungry operations.",
      "In some cases, Big Tech is building climate-friendlier projects like solar, wind, geothermal or battery storage.",
      "But industry decision-makers are also turning to natural gas for what they say is a cheap and reliable source of power, raising the prospect that gas-fired power will play a bigger role \u2014 and for a longer period of time \u2014 than even they had anticipated.",
      "\u201cGas is growing faster now and in the medium term than ever before,\u201d said Corianna Mah, a power and renewables analyst at data analytics firm Enverus.",
      "Before the spike in electricity demand last year, many in the industry had assumed that there would be few new gas plants and that the nation's fleet would gradually retire in favor of a grid powered by wind, solar, geothermal, batteries and possibly the next generation of nuclear power \u2014 sources that don't emit the planet-warming greenhouse gas carbon dioxide.",
      "For many countries, that ramp down is happening as they work toward the goal of slashing their emissions to zero \u2014 or at least, net zero \u2014 by 2050, which scientists say could help the world avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., the electric power sector is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to government figures. And the construction of every new natural gas plant \u2014 built to last for decades \u2014 is a setback for climate goals, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.",
      "\u201cAt a top level, we will not get to net zero by 2050 if we are building new gas plants. Period,\u201d Quigley said.",
      "Burning natural gas emits carbon dioxide, and before that, when it escapes from wellheads or pipelines in its unburned form, it's an even more potent greenhouse gas called methane.",
      "Quigley and others say there is enough solar, wind and battery storage projects on the drawing board to satisfy growing electricity demand. But, they say, utilities and grid operators lack the will to abandon natural gas.",
      "Enverus now projects the next five years will bring roughly 46 gigawatts of gas-fired power online. That compares to 39 gigawatts in the past five years, it said.",
      "Announcements last year alone include:",
      "\u2014 two 705-megawatt plants by Evergy in Kansas;",
      "\u2014 Entergy's 2,300-megawatt plant to serve Meta\u2019s $10 billion AI data center in northern Louisiana, a pair of new plants in Texas and another in Mississippi;",
      "\u2014 a 1,450-megawatt plant by the Tennessee Valley Authority;",
      "\u2014 a 1,400 megawatt Duke Energy project in North Carolina;",
      "\u2014 and Georgia Power's plans for three oil or gas units with a capacity of up to 1,300 megawatts.",
      "And that\u2019s not all.",
      "Calpine said it's exploring new gas-fired capacity in the congested mid-Atlantic region, especially Pennsylvania and Ohio, where analysts say the grid operator is trying to fast-track new gas-fired power plants into service.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the former Homer City coal-fired power plant is being transformed into a massive gas-fired station that's expected to supply a data center \u2014 and got a $5 million state grant to do it.",
      "On top of the artificial intelligence boom, the frenzy for new electricity is fueled by cryptomining, the broader electrification of society and a bipartisan push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "It is coinciding with the closure of coal plants and aging nuclear plants, unable to compete with cheaper gas, solar and wind.",
      "Across the U.S., gas pipeline operators are exuberant about the new demand and are reporting strong interest in extending their lines.",
      "Chris Kalnin, the CEO of BKV, the largest natural-gas producer in the Barnett Shale gas reservoir in Texas, said the trend there is toward gas plants being built next to data centers in a booming data center corridor in metropolitan Dallas.",
      "Data center developers there are in an \u201carms race\u201d to secure power, Kalnin said.",
      "\u201cData center guys are trying to source power and trying to get to market with their data centers as fast as possible,\" Kalnin said. The key to signing up cloud-computing customers \"is getting your facility online quickly and getting your facility online quickly requires you to have power and dependable power and a cost-efficient power source.\u201d",
      "Rob Jennings of the American Petroleum Institute, said the sudden growth in actual and forecast electricity demand has put a premium on power sources that can be built fast and cheaply and are reliable.",
      "That means natural gas is once again attractive to investors over solar and wind, he said.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, the reality has dawned on most that it has to be gas,\u201d Jennings said.",
      "Industry officials say they strive to deliver electricity that is clean, reliable and affordable.",
      "For instance, some new gas plants are replacing higher-pollution coal-fired plants, some are designed to run only at times of high demand, some are paired with battery storage or a wind farm nearby and some are designed with carbon-capture technology or to run on a hydrogen blend, said Alex Bond of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents U.S. investor-owned electric companies.",
      "At the very least, building gas-fired capacity will have high-level political support.",
      "In his remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, President Donald Trump declared that he'd issue \u201cemergency declarations\u201d to get coal - and gas-plants built to make the U.S. a superpower of manufacturing, cryptomining and artificial intelligence.",
      "But Amanda Levin of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the U.S. must take big steps by 2035 to reduce its reliance on gas.",
      "That means slashing a fleet of roughly 1,500 gas plants down to about 100 if the U.S. is to meet strong climate commitments and preserve a chance of addressing climate change, she said.",
      "Still, she said there are reasons to be optimistic that gas plant projects on the drawing board won\u2019t get built.",
      "In recent weeks, Chinese tech startup Deepseek released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies and at a fraction of the cost \u2014 calling into question the need for a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers.",
      "And some analysts believe utilities overestimate the electricity they\u2019ll need, essentially by double- or triple-counting data center proposals when firms express interest in multiple locations \u2014 but only build in one.",
      "Besides, Levin said, data center operators are getting better at energy efficiency, particularly in how they cool their servers.",
      "Even if all the gas plants are built, they may not get used, she said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of reasons,\u201d Levin said, \"for why we might not actually see all of this (demand) materialize.\u201d",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam is revising its energy plans to focus more on large solar farms and less on reliance on coal and natural gas. The fast-growing economy now aims to get 16% of its energy from the sun \u2014 more than triple its earlier target of just 5%.",
      "A draft of the new policy outline, likely to be finalized in coming weeks, scraps plans to build offshore wind turbines, instead building more onshore wind capacity, rooftop solar and energy storage.",
      "Offshore wind and new gas projects have proven expensive and difficult. Large solar farms are cheaper and easier to build.",
      "But Vietnam also is emphasizing expansion of large solar farms to meet soaring demand for power generation. It forecasts it will need more than 211 gigawatts of energy by 2030 as its economy grows, 40% more than its previous estimate and more than Germany's current total capacity.",
      "\u201cThis reflects both an overall increase in potential power demand by 2030 and the fact that LNG (or liquefied natural gas) projects are not on track to be completed by 2030,\u201d said Giles Cooper, a partner at the international law firm Allens based in Hanoi who specializes in energy policy.",
      "Solar power expanded rapidly in Vietnam from 2018 to 2020, helped by generous government policies, as it leaped past its neighbors and some richer nations like the United Kingdom. But construction of new solar capacity stalled in 2020 as the Southeast Asian nation realized that its creaky electricity grid was getting overloaded since electricity was only available when the sun shone.",
      "\u201cIt was like the market almost stopped,\u201d said Dimitri Pescia, of Berlin-based thinktank Agora Energiewende.",
      "Use of polluting coal, which releases earth-warming gases into the atmosphere, has surged and Vietnam is set to become of the world's top five coal importers, displacing Taiwan, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Like many other countries, Vietnam still needs to upgrade its rickety grid, which has failed to keep up with rapid growth of clean power generation. However, it has made improvements and gained experience dealing with energy sources that aren\u2019t always availables, Cooper said.",
      "Last year, authorities allowed electricity-guzzling factories to buy power directly from energy producers, aiming to ease pressure on the overstrained power grid and help big manufacturers like Samsung Electronics meet their climate targets. But that was hindered by a lack of space to build clean energy projects close to factories.",
      "Solar energy is \u201cseen as the most promising technology to kick start\u201d those direct purchases, Cooper said.",
      "But while it's building clean power capacity, Vietnam is also ramping up use of coal. That's partly to make up for lost hydropower capacity due to drought, and also to meet soaring demand as businesses shift factories from China to Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam is Southeast Asia's second-biggest coal producer after Indonesia. It also imported 50 million ton of coal in the first three quarters of 2024 \u2014 a 31% increase, according to government data.",
      "Pescia noted that Vietnam\u2019s coal-fired power plants aren\u2019t very old and operators have yet to recoup their investments.",

      "An attorney for a Texas pipeline company says he will show at trial that various Greenpeace entities coordinated delays and disruptions of a controversial oil pipeline's construction in North Dakota and defamed the company to its lenders",
      "MANDAN, N.D. -- An attorney for a Texas pipeline company said Wednesday at trial that he will prove various Greenpeace entities coordinated delays and disruptions of a controversial oil pipeline's construction in North Dakota, and defamed the company to its lenders.",
      "Attorneys for the Greenpeace defendants told a jury there is no evidence to back up the claims by Dallas-based Energy Transfer, which seeks potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in damages from Greenpeace.",
      "The case is tied to protests in 2016 and 2017 of the Dakota Access Pipeline and its controversial Missouri River crossing upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline as a risk to its water supply. The pipeline was completed in 2017.",
      "Energy Transfer and its subsidiary Dakota Access allege trespass, nuisance, defamation and other offenses by Netherlands-based Greenpeace International and its American branch, Greenpeace USA. The lawsuit also names the group\u2019s funding arm, Greenpeace Fund Inc.",
      "Greenpeace paid professional protesters to come to the area, sent blockade supplies, organized or led protester trainings, passed \u201ccritical intel\u201d to the protesters and told untrue things to stop the pipeline from being built, the plaintiffs' attorney, Trey Cox, told the jury in his opening statement.",
      "\u201cThey didn't think that there would ever be a day of reckoning, but that day of reckoning begins today,\u201d Cox said in opening statements.",
      "Attorneys for the defendants emphasized what they said are distinctions between the various Greenpeace entities, such as what they do and how they're organized.",
      "They said Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund Inc. had zero involvement in the protests, while Greenpeace USA had six employees at Standing Rock for five to 51 days. Greenpeace is committed to nonviolence, and only got involved at Standing Rock because of tribal outreach, the attorneys said.",
      "\u201cThis was an Indigenous-led movement by the Native tribes, and we wanted them to have the spotlight,\" said Greenpeace USA attorney Everett Jack Jr.",
      "One of nine alleged defamatory statements \u2014 that Energy Transfer desecrated burial grounds and culturally important sites during construction \u2014 was made many times by the tribe before any of the Greenpeace statements, he said.",
      "Cox said that statement was included in a letter sent to Energy Transfer's banks and signed by the executive directors of Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA.",
      "He added that Energy Transfer made 140 adjustments to its pipeline route in order to respect sacred sites.",
      "\u201cOur goal was to be a good corporate citizen in North Dakota,\u201d Cox said.",
      "More than 500 organizations from more than 50 countries signed on to that letter, said Greenpeace International attorney Courtney DeThomas, who described it as an act of free expression.",
      "No financial institution will testify that it received, read or was influenced by the letter, which was signed after thousands of protesters were already at Standing Rock, DeThomas said.",
      "Greenpeace representatives have said the lawsuit is an example of corporations abusing the legal system to go after critics and is a critical test of free speech and protest rights. An Energy Transfer spokesperson said the case is about Greenpeace not following the law, not free speech.",
      "Greenpeace says the lawsuit is going after $300 million, citing a figure from a previous federal case. The lawsuit complaint asks for damages in an amount to be proved at trial.",
      "Because of Greenpeace, Energy Transfer incurred over $82 million in security, contractor and property costs, and lost $80 million of profits, Cox told jurors. The pipeline was supposed to be completed by Jan. 1, 2017, but wasn\u2019t moving oil until five months later, he said.",
      "Greenpeace's \u201cdeceptive narrative scared off lenders\" and Energy Transfer lost half its banks, he said. The company suffered over $68 million in lost financing and spent $7.6 million for public relations \"to deal with these problems and lies\u201d from the \u201cwhisper campaign,\" Cox said.",
      "But Jack said Greenpeace had nothing to do with the company's delays in operating or refinancing. He also disputed how Energy Transfer is claiming or calculating its damages. The company also has no expert to back its claim of reputational harm, he said.",
      "Jury selection took place earlier in the week and the estimated five-week trial is now underway. Nine jurors and two alternates will hear the case in Mandan, North Dakota.",
      "The company filed a similar case in federal court in 2017, which a judge dismissed in 2019. Energy Transfer subsequently filed the lawsuit now at trial in state court.",
      "Earlier in February, Greenpeace International filed an anti-intimidation suit in the District Court of Amsterdam against Energy Transfer, saying the company acted wrongfully and should pay costs and damages resulting from its \u201cmeritless\u201d litigation.",

      "Government agencies have been directed to submit by March 13 their plans for what is known as a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees but eliminate positions altogether.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported that U.S. employers added 143,000 jobs in January, significantly fewer than December\u2019s 256,000 job gains. However, the unemployment rate ticked down to an even 4%, signaling a still very healthy labor market.",

      "For the three months that ended Jan. 26, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $39.3 billion, up 12% from the previous quarter and 78% from one year ago. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 89 cents a share.",

      "The fourth-quarter earnings are the company\u2019s first report since Chinese company DeepSeek boasted it had developed a large language model that could compete with ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, but was more cost-effective in its use of Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data.",

      "The U.S. Center for SafeSport's recent firing of an investigator who was arrested for sex crimes is having a negative ripple effect for some of the people whose cases he handled",
      "DENVER -- It took time, patience and months of therapy before Jacqui Stevenson could leave behind the anxiety and suicidal thoughts stemming from an ordeal involving her childhood swim coach that stretched out for more than two decades.",
      "A glance at her phone earlier this month forced some of those feelings back to the surface.",
      "\"I checked my email and just had a total panic attack,\u201d Stevenson said.",
      "The Feb. 12 email from general counsel Jessica Perrill began: \u201cI\u2019m reaching out about a recent incident involving the investigator who was assigned to your U.S. Center for SafeSport (the Center) case, Jason Krasley.\u201d",
      "Thus began an angst-infused spiral for Stevenson, whose story serves as a bracing example of the potentially devastating ripple effect the former police officer-turned-SafeSport investigator\u2019s arrest for sex crimes \u2014 and the center\u2019s response to it \u2014 can have on the people whose cases he handled.",
      "Before receiving the email, Stevenson had viewed Krasley, a former vice cop at the Allentown, Pennsylvania, police department, as the only person who really had her back when she reported abuse in December 2022. She still believed that when the case was quietly resolved and closed, some 14 months later, with the coach receiving a one-year probation after admitting to inappropriately kissing Stevenson when she was a teen.",
      "When Perrill\u2019s email landed with a jolt, informing Stevenson that Krasley had been arrested and charged with rape, theft and other crimes she started rethinking everything.",
      "Stevenson, now 38, living about an hour southwest of Philly and working as a director for a major software company, said she also has grave doubts about the center\u2019s position, stated in Perrill\u2019s email, that \u201cwe don\u2019t currently have reason to believe\u201d Krasley had been involved in wrongdoing over the three years he worked at the organization.",
      "She wonders if expressing her doubts to the third-party auditing group the center hired to collect information about cases Krasley handled might lead the center to reopen her case and, in turn, give the man she accused, who still coaches kids, a chance of having wrongdoing wiped off his record.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s probably looking at this and going, \u2018Sweet, I\u2019m off scot-free,\u2019\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cAnd all of this is just confirming to him that he can do whatever the hell he wants.\u201d",
      "The center said it asked for the third-party audit out of an abundance of caution, to ensure fair and proper handling of cases.",
      "\u201cWe recognize the emotional toll revisiting cases may have, so we have been working closely with experts to ensure any outreach to parties is done in a trauma-informed manner, including offering support resources,\u201d CEO Ju\u2019Riese Col\u00f3n said.",
      "According to Perrill\u2019s email, the center fired Krasley on Nov. 15, 2024, immediately upon learning of his arrest for allegedly stealing drug money seized from a raid he was involved in as a vice cop in 2019.",
      "Two months later, details emerged of new arrests for allegations of rape, sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution \u2013 allegations that dated to 2015. Krasley\u2019s attorney says his client is innocent of those charges.",
      "The center has not divulged how many cases Krasley handled over his three years working there, though that was one of the questions Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, asked when he opened an inquiry on the center earlier this month.",
      "Stevenson said after getting the email, she reevaluated the hours she had spent on the phone with Krasley, the friendly vibe he gave off that bordered on oversharing, and memories of him telling her that \u201cI\u2019m not a therapist, but I\u2019m here for you and we\u2019re gonna get this (expletive).\u201d",
      "She regretted having sent him pictures of her, cuddled up on the couch with the coach \u2013 her abuser \u2013 from back when she was 14 and the coach was 21.",
      "She started wondering if Krasley \u2014 a man people put their trust in to get to the bottom of sensitive cases, some involving sex abuse and harassment \u2014 had appropriately handled other evidence she and a friend had offered of what they said were more recent instances of the coach abusing minors.",
      "After finding no help from police in investigating her abuser, she worries that the center \u2013 which was opened in 2017 to combat sex abuse in Olympic sports, and which Stevenson once considered her last line of defense \u2013 could disappear in the wake of a sordid episode like this.",
      "\u201cAnd now, everyone who dealt with him has to deal with that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat he did in his previous role has now tainted everything he touched at SafeSport. And this could bring down an organization, and then what? SafeSport\u2019s not perfect, but at least it\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "Stevenson\u2019s concerns date to the early 2000s, when she came under the influence of the same coach she would turn in to the center nearly 20 years later.",
      "She said the interactions between her and the coach involved marijuana, alcohol, late-night parties and kissing as part of a relationship that she said spiraled into inappropriateness that she could not truly recognize until many years had passed.",
      "More than 15 years later, she reconnected with the coach at a swim club near her old hometown where she herself became a coach, then a member of the club\u2019s board of directors. She still viewed the coach in a decent light, but when she saw him exhibiting some of the same behaviors she experienced as a kid, red flags started going up.",
      "Eventually, the swim club fired the coach \u2014 who is not being identified by AP because he never landed on SafeSport\u2019s Centralized Disciplinary Database, nor was he charged by police \u2014 sparking his defenders to retaliate by starting a petition to have Stevenson removed from the board.",
      "That sent her into a tailspin that she said included thoughts of suicide and a guilty conscience because she saw kids were in harm\u2019s way and felt helpless to do anything about it.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part for me was getting Jacqui to the finish line, and I felt like we got her across the line, and then she gets smacked in the face with this,\u201d said Mike Scime, a friend of Stevenson\u2019s who helped her cope with the mental-health issues that set in as the case evolved.",
      "Stevenson\u2019s own bad experience with the police is an example of what led the SafeSport Center, which touts its independence from traditional legal channels as one of its strengths, to argue that it will often go further than law enforcement and other investigative bodies to ensure athlete safety.",
      "It took about two months for the center to assign an investigator to the case after Stevenson reported it. That investigator turned out to be Krasley.",
      "Stevenson said the former police officer had a way of making her feel he was the only person who truly understood her problems.",
      "\u201cWhen I think about it,\u201d she said, \u201cit felt hauntingly similar to what (the coach) did to me when I was 14.\u201d",

      "Vanderbilt freshman Mikayla Blakes knows each time she drops the ball in the basket it will bring more attention",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Vanderbilt freshman Mikayla Blakes knows each time she drops the ball in the basket it will bring more attention.",
      "That's what happens when someone scores 53 points, then sets the NCAA freshman single-game scoring record with 55 just 17 days later.",
      "\u201cEverybody wants to stop you now,\" Blakes said about being a bigger target for opponent's scouting plans. \u201cSo I think just continuing to keep going and continue to keep working on my weaknesses and turn them into strengths is definitely going to help me.\u201d",
      "Blakes has scored at least 30 points in five games, tied for fourth-most by any NCAA Division I player this season and most among freshmen. She ranks second in the Southeastern Conference averaging 23.3 points a game.",
      "South Carolina coach Dawn Staley called Blakes special after her No. 6 Gamecocks held the freshman to 19 points last weekend. Blakes got only two in the fourth quarter as the Gamecocks made Blakes work hard on both ends of the court.",
      "\u201cTo come in our league and to have done what she\u2019s done, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a bigger offensive impact,\" Staley said. \"I mean, she\u2019s very, very efficient.\u201d",
      "Blakes already is in exclusive company.",
      "Her 55 points are the ninth most scored in NCAA history. She also joined Patricia Hoskins of Mississippi Valley State as the only players to score 53 or more points twice in the same season. Blakes scored 53 on Jan. 30 in a win at Florida.",
      "With Vanderbilt trailing by 15 with 6:55 left at Auburn, even her brother Jaylen watching on TV thought that game was over. Then she took over, scoring 30 of her 55 points over the final 10 minutes, 25 seconds of regulation and overtime in the victory.",
      "Blakes also went 23 of 24 at the line. She knocked down down her first 23 attempts on her way to the single-game scoring record first set by Elena Delle Donne with 54 as a redshirt freshman at Delaware in a 2010 loss to James Madison.",
      "It's just not about the points. Her brother knows only too well the sister he worked out with and played 1-on-1 with couldn't let the Commodores lose.",
      "\u201cShe hates losing,\" Jaylen said. \"At the end of the day, she hates losing more than she loves winning and for her, that was the most important thing, I think. Obviously the 55 was great, but she was so happy about just winning that game.\u201d",
      "Tara VanDerveer tried to get Blakes to play at Stanford: \u201cShe\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019s a star. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d",
      "The now retired Hall of Fame coach called it disappointing not to get the 2024 McDonald's All-American from Somerset, New Jersey. VanDerveer said she's mad that Jaylen came to Stanford as a graduate transfer this season from Duke and didn't bring his sister with him.",
      "Joking aside, VanDerveer said she loves the Blakes family and called Mikayla a great student and that she is really happy for the 5-foot-8 freshman.",
      "\"She\u2019s doing really well,\u201d VanDerveer said.",
      "Everybody wanted Blakes. Stanford, UCLA, Tennessee, Indiana, Wisconsin and Rutgers were among those recruiting her. Shea Ralph convinced Blakes to become her highest-rated recruit yet for the coach's fourth season at Vanderbilt.",
      "Jaylen, who joined the family on some Zoom calls as coaches pitched away, knows why Mikayla chose a program with only one Final Four berth way back in 1993 and now is on the verge of a second straight NCAA Tournament berth after a 10-year drought.",
      "\u201cShe was just about building something,\u201d Jaylen said.",
      "Thanks to Stanford playing on Wednesdays and Saturdays and the Vanderbilt women on Thursdays and Sundays, the Blakes siblings are able to keep up with each other's games.",
      "In that comeback against Auburn, Mikayla Blakes joined LeBron James as the only basketball players to score 55 or more points playing every second of a game since 2005 whether at the NBA, WNBA, NCAA men or women's basketball level.",
      "She also earned both the SEC player and freshman of the week, something not done in this league since Candace Parker in 2006.",
      "Ralph said while Blakes has not been a secret for a long time now, she liked how the point guard played against South Carolina. Ralph is focused on making sure her freshman doesn't have to score 50 to win as the Commodores host Texas A&M on Thursday night in their final home game of the regular season.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s done it in moments where we\u2019ve really needed it,\" Ralph said. \u201cBut she also has to get a little bit of help.\u201d",

      "Pass rusher Abdul Carter says he should be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Former Penn State star Abdul Carter made one thing clear Wednesday: He should be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft.",
      "Carter was in the first group of players to speak with reporters at the NFL's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis, and he wasted no time declaring himself the top player in the 2025 draft class.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m the best player in the country and the best player should be picked first,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the work I put in with my dad, who trained me, and all the sacrifices I made, I know I\u2019m the best.\u201d",
      "Of course, such pronouncements have come to be expected during combine week.",
      "Still, Carter certainly has a case after finishing last season with 68 tackles, a Football Bowl Subdivision-leading 23 1/2 tackles for loss and 12 sacks to finish seventh nationally.",
      "He was the Big Ten's top defensive player in 2024 and finished his three-year career with 39 1/2 tackles for loss, 23 sacks and 14 passes defensed.",
      "The question is whether the 6-foot-3, 259-pound Carter is a better fit at defensive end or outside linebacker. Either way, he's likely to be the first or second defensive player selected April 24 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.",
      "Going No. 1 overall remains a challenge, though.",
      "Since 2007 only three defensive players have been chosen No. 1 overall \u2014 Jadeveon Clowney in 2014, Myles Garrett in 2017 and Travon Walker in 2022. Each was chosen primarily because of their pass-rushing ability.",
      "And leapfrogging the top two quarterbacks, Cam Ward of Miami and Shedeur Sanders of Colorado, or Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter could prove difficult.",
      "\u201cI think quarterbacks have kind of a lock on that or maybe a great pass rusher,\u201d Cincinnati Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin said Tuesday when asked about a non-quarterback being the top overall selection. \u201cOr maybe a guy that plays six positions like the one from my alma mater. We\u2019ll see.\u201d",
      "Tobin, who attended Colorado, was referring to Hunter, who is listed as a cornerback but hopes to also play receiver in the NFL as he did in college.",
      "Yet Carter believes he can defy the odds and become the third Penn State player to hear his name called first on draft weekend. Tennessee holds the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "\"Defensive players impact the game just as much as the quarterback,\u201d the 21-year-old Carter said. \u201cAll the teams that have won Super Bowls, they have that one standout player. I feel like I\u2019m that.\u201d",

      "The movie \u2014 ranked as the No. 1 sports film of all-time by The Associated Press in 2020 \u2014 was released in 1986. Hackman starred as Dale, a man who was given a second chance at coaching after his first one ended after striking one of his players years earlier.",
      "The tale follows the journey of the Hickory Huskers, a team that in the movie version took on big-city South Bend Central in the 1952 state championship game and won with Jimmy Chitwood hitting a buzzer-beater. The story is loosely based on the real-life story of small-school Milan winning Indiana\u2019s 1954 state championship. Bobby Plump was the hero in the actual game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about change,\" Hackman once said. \"It\u2019s about what happens with change, how we deal with it, where we learn to give up our ideas about who we are as people.\u201d",
      "Since the movie's release, tourists have stopped in Milan and other sites where filming took place.",
      "Susan Cottingham, secretary and treasurer of the Milan \u201954 Hoosiers Museum and lifelong resident of the town of 1,800, said Thursday she expected a steady flow of visitors over the next few days, though the place was quiet hours after news of Hackman\u2019s death broke.",
      "Cottingham said she's watched the movie at least a dozen times \u2014 probably on the low end for Hoosiers aficionados \u2014 and has hazy memories of when Milan High made its real-life run to the championship. Other than to say, \u201cOh, my,\u201d she couldn't put into words what the team's accomplishment and movie have meant to the town.",
      "\u201cI remember the excitement and the celebration and my parents heading to the games,\u201d she said. \"The celebration when they got back from winning state, there was between 30 and 40,000 people here. So even at 5 years old, that was pretty noticeable.\u201d",
      "The museum first opened in the early 1960s with displays from the 1954 Milan High team. The museum moved into its current location in 2013 and features the uniforms worn in the movie and the set from the hospital scene featuring co-star Dennis Hopper.",
      "Hackman never visited the museum though he had a standing invitation. The movie's writer, Angelo Pizzo, and a few of the lesser-known cast members have made several appearances.",

Gary Woodland is a constant inspiration to us all.\u201d",
      "The Courage Award includes a contribution of $25,000 from the tour to a charity of the recipient's choice.

      "\u201cHe can be whatever he wants to be, he's that talented,\u201d Denver Broncos general manager George Paton said. \u201cWe're still working through it, you know, but I think he's going to play on both sides of the ball. I'll just leave it at that.\u201d",
      "Hunter certainly thrived in both spots in college, first at Jackson State in Mississippi before following his coach, Sanders, to Boulder, Colorado. In his final two college seasons, Hunter had 153 receptions, 1,979 yards, 20 TDs, broke up 11 passes and had four interceptions.",
      "Combine organizers gave Hunter a defensive backs T-shirt, partly because it gives him the option of doing on-field drills with the defense Friday and offense Saturday \u2014 if he chooses.",
      "The first indication he'll do either, or both, could come Thursday when he's scheduled to speak with reporters.",
      "Sanders is already lobbying publicly for his star player, urging any team that doesn't intend to use Hunter as a cornerback and as a receiver to pass on drafting him.",
      "Yet most executives who fielded questions Tuesday seem to concur with Sanders' assessment that Hunter can excel at both, even if they believe he should start at cornerback as a rookie.",
      "\u201cTravis is obviously an exceptional talent. He can do it all, that\u2019s no secret,\u201d Carolina Panthers coach Dan Morgan said. \"Yes, he can play both sides of the ball. That\u2019s up to the team to decide that, whatever team that drafts him.\u201d",
      "One lingering question is how many snaps can Hunter be expected to play at the pro level without declining production?",
      "He held up relatively well at Colorado, where he logged roughly 2,500 snaps between 2023 and 2024. But he'll be facing bigger, stronger, faster opponents in the NFL, plus a more physical style, a 17-game regular season and even more games if his team makes the playoffs.",
      "Few would argue Hunter is the best athlete in this year's draft or a legitimate top-five talent, but everyone is trying to figure out just how high someone with Hunter's talent will go in a draft where quarterbacks tend to be the first pick, the second pick and last year the top three picks.",
      "That could the case again with Tennessee, Cleveland and the New York Giants holding the top three selections with each presumably looking for new franchise quarterbacks.",
      "\u201cI think quarterbacks have kind of a lock on that or maybe a great pass rusher,\u201d Cincinnati Bengals general manager Duke Tobin said when asked about a non-quarterback being the top overall selection. \u201cOr maybe a guy that plays six positions like the one from my alma mater (Colorado). We'll see.\u201d",
      "But with third-year quarterback Will Levis still on the Titans roster, Callahan and general manager Mike Borgonzi aren't ruling out anything. Even taking Hunter, who could fill two holes in their rebuilding effort.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a special player,\u201d Borgonzi said. \u201cWe were watching him, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anybody that\u2019s actually done what he\u2019s done in modern-day football, playing both offense and defense during the course of a season. He\u2019s definitely a special player.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt allowed me the opportunity to get a college degree,\u201d the former Boston mayor and U.S. secretary of labor said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI went to school with people that were undergrads, that went to school at BC, taking class at night. And I was (also) in class with people in their 70s. Which is amazing.\u201d",
      "Woods College Dean David Goodman said the agreement is \u201cthe next evolution of a relationship that was already there,\u201d by removing \"some of the friction\" that might have prevented players from going back to school. It will make it easier for potential students to transfer previously earned credits, as one example, he said.",
      "Josh Jooris, who played three years at Union College before earning his first NHL contract with the Calgary Flames, is currently enrolled. Brooks Orpik, who played three years for the Eagles before an NHL career in which he won two Stanley Cup championships with the Pittsburgh Penguins, returned to school after he retired and earned his degree in 2022.",
      "\u201cI had promised a lot of people, including my parents and former BC hockey coach Jerry York, that I would finish college at some point,\u201d Orpik said. \u201cThe feeling of pride I had was just so different than anything, athletically, I have accomplished.\u201d",
      "Goodman said the students can study online, on-campus or hybrid. The new agreement doesn\u2019t have a limit on the number of players it can accept, but Goodman said he expects \u201ca couple of dozen\u201d; if there are more, the school would add sections to accommodate them, he said.",
      "The NHLPA agreement with BC comes the same week as the Major League Baseball Players Association announced a similar deal with Syracuse. Walsh said he hadn't talked to his baseball counterparts about it.",
      "\u201cWe all have programs,\u201d said NHLPA head, who needed more than 10 years, taking one or two classes per semester, to get his degree while he was working full-time, including as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a union that represents our workers on the on the ice and through to collective bargaining,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also want to make sure that we\u2019re preparing these players, that when their careers are over, that they're set up for success going forward, too.\u201d",
      "The NHL says more than a third of its players played college hockey in the U.S. or Canada, with the majority of those leaving school before getting their degrees. Both Woods and Walsh noted that even players who go on to a successful NHL career would likely retire in their 30s, leaving a long worklife ahead of them.",
      "\u201cThese players are typically scooped up in their first two years,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWhen they come back after having been successful, coming back to one\u2019s education is not necessarily a sexy move. But it\u2019s finishing something they once started.\u201d",

      "Norwegian soccer will vote this weekend on whether to scrap the use of video reviews in its top league after a turbulent couple of years since the technology was introduced in the Nordic country",
      "Norwegian soccer will vote this weekend on whether to scrap the use of video reviews in its top league after a turbulent couple of years since the technology was introduced.",
      "The decision will be noted with plenty of interest around the soccer world, given the video review system \u2014 or VAR, as it is better known \u2014 has had such a huge impact on the sport since being formally written into the laws of the game in 2018.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how and why Norwegian soccer has reached this stage, what to expect in the vote, and why it is significant.",
      "The Norwegian soccer federation brought in video technology in 2023, in a way some found controversial. That\u2019s because the decision was reached before Norway\u2019s member-run clubs could establish a unified position on whether they wanted VAR, leading to disgruntlement among some fans who felt the democratic process in the Norwegian game had been undermined. Disillusionment increased in the early months of VAR\u2019s adoption, with the technology taking seven minutes to decide on an offside call in one match.",
      "Disillusionment about VAR quickly led to active protests about the use of the technology \u2014 and some were very quirky in their nature. A match between Rosenborg and Lillestr\u00f8m was suspended \u2014 and later abandoned and restaged behind closed doors \u2014 after fans threw fish cakes and then tennis balls onto the field soon after kickoff. In the second tier, fans of Lyn disrupted a game by throwing champagne corks onto the pitch in what was viewed as a protest against VAR. Amid such strident anti-VAR sentiment at certain clubs, the federation agreed to set up a working group to look further into the issue. And in a vote in January of the 32 clubs making up the top two leagues in Norway, 19 voted to scrap VAR and 13 to keep it. A recommendation was sent to the federation to support the clubs' majority decision and remove VAR \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "In a blow to anti-VAR campaigners, the Norwegian Football Association came out in favor of the technology a week later, with president Lise Klaveness saying the association acknowledged processes needed improving but wanted to retain video officials. \u201cThe governing body unanimously concluded that the best thing for Norwegian football is to maintain and develop it,\u201d Klaveness said. For Anders Kjellevold, chairman of the Norwegian supporters\u2019 alliance, it felt like a betrayal, saying most people thought the vote of the top clubs would be decisive. \u201dIf we end up with a decision where the FA decides not to listen to the affected clubs in this issue, then we are undermining club democracy and club democracy is a bulwark against many of the negative aspects of football,\" Kjellevold told The Associated Press.",
      "The final decision on whether to scrap VAR will be taken at a vote at the federation's congress taking place over Saturday and Sunday. All clubs which are active members of the federation are allowed to vote, along with leaders of the federation's counties and members of the federation board. A majority decision is needed either way. Anti-VAR campaigners fear many clubs who vote will end up siding with the view of the federation, as is the tradition in major decisions in order to maintain good relations with the governing body. The vast majority of clubs which will be voting aren't affected by VAR because the technology is used only in the top division.",
      "According to Kjellevold, anti-VAR sentiment lingers because the technology \u201cis incompatible with the intention of the game of football.\u201d It ruins \u201cthe experience of football as a live spectator,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it brings up these stoppages in the game, it takes away some of the euphoria of a goal, which is just vital to a game and how we live it when we use so much of our time and effort to follow the game.\u201d Kjellevold is just as unhappy at how the whole process has been handled, chiefly how the teams most affected by VAR might not get their voices heard.",
      "The result of the vote is significant on a wider level because Norway scrapping VAR might influence supporters in other countries to step up protests about the technology in an effort to remove it from their leagues. Premier League clubs voted in June to continue using VAR after being asked to consider scrapping the technology following controversies last season. Sweden is one of the few countries in Europe to have decided against introducing VAR to its league.",

      "Knapp \u2014 the No. 99 player in golf's current world rankings \u2014 shot a bogey-free 59 in the opening round of the Cognizant Classic at PGA National, the 15th time that someone has broken 60 in a PGA Tour event.",
      "Knapp finished one shot off the tour scoring record of 58, done by Jim Furyk in the final round of the 2016 Travelers Championship. Knapp became the 14th player to shoot a sub-60 round; it has been done 15 times, with Furyk the one who has carded such a round twice.",
      "Knapp had a putt for eagle at the par-5 18th that would have tied Furyk\u2019s mark of 58 \u2014 18 feet, 8 inches was the measurement given by the PGA Tour. The eagle putt didn\u2019t have the speed and he tapped in for 59.",
      "The 12-birdie round on the par-71 course also broke the previous Cognizant scoring record of 61, first done in 2012 by Brian Harman and matched in 2021 by Matt Jones. There are three rounds of 62 in tournament history \u2014 Tiger Woods in the final round in 2012 on his way to a tie for second, Brandon Hagy in the second round in 2021 and eventual winner Chris Kirk in the second round of the 2023 event.",
      "There was barely any wind and PGA National was largely defenseless in the morning session. The closest there was to any trouble was the seventh hole, where Billy Horschel \u2014 a Florida Gator from his college days \u2014 used a club to poke at an actual alligator that was catching some sun near the green and got it to retreat back to its watery home.",
      "Even that was easy on Thursday morning. But nobody had an easier time than Knapp, who finished no better than a tie for 17th in any of his first seven starts of 2025 \u2014 and then played his way into golf history in Round 1 at PGA National.",
      "Knapp has one PGA Tour win, that coming at last year\u2019s Mexico Open. He\u2019s played the Cognizant only once before and did well, tying for fourth last year after shooting three rounds of 68 or better and finishing at 13 under.",
      "And this year, so far, he\u2019s even better.",
      "He started Thursday with five straight birdies, that stretch highlighted by a 60-foot putt at the par-4 second hole. The birdies kept coming in bunches; three in a row on holes 9 through 11, three more coming on holes 13 through 15 \u2014 the last of those a big breaking putt from 31 feet, going across the green before dropping dead center into the cup.",
      "A 12-footer for birdie on the par-3 17th hit the outside right edge of the cup and spun off, leaving him at 11 under with only the par-5 finishing hole left.",
      "A 335-yard tee shot left him 200 yards to the hole at No. 18, and a simple two-putt was all that remained to cap the history-making round.",

      "The scourge of unwanted phone calls has been branded an epidemic by consumer groups, while the Federal Communications Commission says it's the top consumer complaint. The calls are a nuisance to many ordinary people, some of whom have complained to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI need help on getting spam calls to stop,\u201d one reader said in an email. She's getting up to 14 calls a day despite the countermeasures she's employed.",
      "As the name implies, robocalls are automated calls to deliver recorded messages to a large number of phones. A robocall purely to deliver a message or collect a debt is allowed under U.S. regulations, but the Federal Trade Commission says robocalls with a recorded voice trying to sell you something are illegal unless you've given explicit written permission to receive them. Many robocalls are also probably scams, the FTC warns.",
      "If you're flooded by unsolicited calls, here are some ways to fight back.",
      "Smartphone users can turn on some built-in settings to combat unknown calls.",
      "Apple advises iPhone users to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Go to your \u201cSettings,\u201d then scroll down to \u201cApps,\u201d and then to \u201cPhone,\u201d where you'll see it under the \u201cCalls\u201d section. When you turn this on, any calls from numbers that you've never been in touch with and aren't saved in your contacts list will not ring through. Instead, they'll be sent to voicemail and show up in your list of recent calls.",
      "Android has a similar setting that allows you to block calls from private or unidentified numbers, although you will still receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in your contact list.",
      "Just keep in mind that you could also end up not getting important calls, which sometimes come from unknown numbers.",
      "If an unwanted call does get through, both Android and iPhone users can block the individual phone number by tapping on it in the recent callers or call history list. You can also enter numbers directly into your phone's block list.",
      "Sign up for the national Do Not Call registry, which is a list of numbers that have opted out of most telemarketing calls. The Federal Trade Commission, which runs the registry, says it only contains phone numbers and holds no other personally identifiable information, nor does the registry know whether the number is for a landline or a cellphone.",
      "The FTC says there are some exemptions, including political calls, calls from non-profit groups and charities, and legitimate survey groups that aren't selling anything. Also allowed are calls from companies up to 18 months after you've done \u2014 or sought to do \u2014 business with them.",
      "But it also warns that while having your number on the registry will cut down on unwanted sales calls, it won\u2019t stop scammers from making illegal calls.",
      "Other countries have similar registries. Canada has its own Do Not Call list while the U.K. has the Telephone Preference Service.",
      "Check whether your wireless carrier has a call-blocking service. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T, three of the biggest U.S. networks, all have their own call filters for customers to block robocalls and report spam. There's typically a free basic version and an advanced version that requires a subscription fee.",
      "If your phone company's filters aren't good enough, try third-party apps to weed out unwanted callers.",
      "There are a host of smartphone apps available that promise to block spam calls, like Nomorobo, YouMail, Hiya, RoboKiller, TrueCaller and others. Many charge a monthly or annual subscription fee but some offer a free basic option. Some also can be installed on landline phones, but only if they use VOIP technology, not copper cables.",
      "The Associated Press hasn't tested any of these apps and isn't making specific recommendations. We recommend you read user reviews and try some out for yourself.",
      "Apple says the apps work by comparing a caller's number with a list of known numbers and labeling them, for example, spam or telemarketing. Then it might automatically block the call. \u201cIncoming calls are never sent to third-party developers,\u201d the company says.",
      "Did you know you can file a complaint with the FCC about specific spam calls? You can do so easily through an online form. It might not give you immediate satisfaction, but the National Consumer Law Center says data on complaints is the best tool federal agencies have for determining how big a problem robocalls are.",
      "While companies you've done business with can make robocalls to you, the National Consumer Law Center says it's probably because you gave consent - possibly hidden in fine print. But you can also revoke your consent at any time.",
      "Just tell the company representative that you want to \u201crevoke consent,\u201d and if that doesn't stop them, contact customer service and tell them that you don't consent to receive calls and want your number added to the company's \u201cdo not call\u201d list, the center says.",
      "You might be tempted to try to engage with the call in an attempt to get your number off the call list or be put through to a real person. The FTC warns against doing this and recommends that you just hang up.",
      "\u201cPressing numbers to speak to someone or remove you from the list will probably only lead to more robocalls,\u201d the agency says on its advice page. \u201cAnd the number on your caller ID probably isn\u2019t real. Caller ID is easy to fake\" and can't be trusted, it says.",
      "Cybersecurity company Kaspersky advises not even saying anything when you receive what you think is a robocall. We've all received scammy calls that start with something like \u201cHello, can you hear me?\u201d to which you've probably replied \u201cyes\u201d without thinking.",
      "Scammers \u201ccan then store the recording of your confirmation and use it for fraudulent activities,\u201d Kaspersky says. \u201cSo, avoid saying yes where possible.\u201d",

The company claims this factory will create \u201cthousands of jobs.\u201d",
      "The announcement is similar to one Apple made in early 2018 \u2014 during the first Trump administration \u2014 that promised to create 20,000 new jobs as part of a $350 billion spend in the U.S. Trump was also mulling a tariff then that could have affected iPhones at the time, but he didn't end up targeting those devices during his first administration."

      "Officials say a first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea",
      "AYIA NAPA, Cyprus -- A first-of-its-kind project will use a swarm of small, independent submersibles to monitor, protect and provide data on offshore artificial reefs whose purpose is to attract new marine life in otherwise barren sections of sea, officials said Monday.",
      "The small, autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, hailed as the \u201cfuture of underwater surveillance\u201d will be equipped with sensors and high-definition cameras to give scientists at the Cyprus Marine and Maritime Institute a clear picture on the effectiveness of their intricate artificial reefs designed and built using 3D printing.",
      "Made of an environmentally friendly cement mixture, the artificial reefs will be embedded with a docking station at which the AUVs can recharge and transmit collected data including video, said CMMI CEO Zakarias Siokouros.",
      "The advantage of the AUVs lies in their ability to loiter underwater for as long as a month at a time and provide a continuous flow of data while \u201cprotecting\u201d the reefs by alerting scientists to any disturbance in protected waters from illegal fishing and encroaching boats. Scientists would, in turn, notify local authorities.",
      "A trial run of the project, dubbed EONIOS, is currently underway off Cyprus\u2019 Ayia Napa marina. Scientists plan to place the artificial reefs in waters off Cyprus\u2019 southern coastal town of Limassol at a depth of around 20 meters (66 feet) where sunlight can still reach the seabed.",
      "\u201cThe reefs attract everything from vegetation to large fish and for waters off Cyprus where there isn\u2019t enough food for fish, we aim to create the appropriate environment to bring such fish there,\u201d Siokouros told The Associated Press following a demonstration of the AUVs' capabilities at the Ayia Napa Marina.",
      "EONIOS is a partnership between the CMMI, AUV makers Arkeocean of France, Cypriot tech company SignalGeneriX and French consultancy company Lanego.",
      "Siokouros said the partnership aims to market EONIOS to other countries who would want to build up their fish stocks using artificial reefs.",
      "A key selling point for the AUVs is that they can provide surveillance, 3D data collection and area protection at a significant discount compared to tethered submersibles, said Arkeocean official Tamara Brizard.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make a system under which six of our mini-drones can do the same work for the price of one conventional drone,\u201d Brizard said.",
      "Arkeocean AUVs can currently pack a maximum 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of sensors and other gear and can operate to a depth of 300 meters (984 feet) although newer versions are being designed to reach 3,000 meters (9,842 feet). The AUVs receive commands through an attached acoustic antenna and can pinpoint their location.",
      "Battery-powered thrusters make the AUVs very stealthy and nearly undetectable, Brizard said, making them extremely useful for defense purposes such as surveillance in restricted waters. The AUVs can operate anywhere in the world thanks to an Iridium satellite antenna.",
      "The AUVs can also use undersea currents to roam, extending battery life. Another application is in the energy field where the submersibles can be used to detect seismic activity for offshore oil and gas exploration as well as finding suitable areas on which to build offshore wind and solar farms, said Brizard."

      "\"At no time did the two officers indicate that Defendant was free to go; nor did they explain the reasons as to why Defendant was being detained; other than that, he looked suspicious and/or over stayed his welcome as a customer at McDonalds,\" Dickey wrote.",

      "He has also pleaded not guilty to murder charges in New York, a case that takes precedence over the case in Pennsylvania, where court dates have been scrapped and no new dates set. Mangione also faces federal charges, including a charge of murder through the use of a firearm, which makes him eligible for the death penalty.",
      "His New York attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, has also raised questions about Mangione's treatment in Pennsylvania custody, arguing during a recent hearing that police body camera footage indicates her client's \"constitutional rights were violated.\"",
      "\"I think there's a very, very serious search issue in this matter, and there might be evidence that is suppressed,\" Agnifilo said.",

      "Rafael Caro Quintero, 72, was arraigned on multiple drug and weapons offenses in Brooklyn federal court following his extradition Thursday to the U.S. from Mexico.",
      "\"Today is a historic event,\" Frank Tarentino, the special agent in charge of the DEA's New York division, said at a press briefing outside the courthouse following the hearing. \"We have waited 40 years for this day. This day, when justice would be served.\"",

      "\"After 40 years the man who murdered Enrique Camarena is finally facing justice in the United States,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Saritha Komatireddy said in court. \"Justice never forgets.\"",

      "Caro Quintero was among 29 top drug operatives Mexico who were expelled and transferred to the U.S. under pressure from the Trump administration.",
      "He was convicted in Mexico in 1985 of the torture and murder of Camarena, one of the most notorious killings in the history of the Mexican narco wars. After serving 28 years of his 40-year sentence, he was released from prison in 2013 when a Mexican judge ruled that he had been improperly tried. Caro Quintero promptly went into hiding, as U.S. officials stridently condemned the release.",
      "In 2018, he was added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, with a $20 million reward available for information leading to his arrest or capture.",
      "The criminal ringleader was once again detained in Mexico in 2022, nearly 10 years after his release. At the time, the FBI said that he was allegedly involved in the Sinaloa cartel and the Caro-Quintero drug trafficking organization in the region of Badiraguato in Sinaloa, Mexico, and warned that he should be considered \"armed and extremely dangerous.\"",
      "Caro Quintero is charged in the Eastern District of New York with multiple drug and weapons offenses, including leading a continuing criminal enterprise, making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted.",
      "In his remarks outside the courthouse, Tarentino said Camarena \"remains a symbol of strength, honor, courage, unity and determination.\"",
      "\"Rafael Caro Quintero, the man responsible for Kiki's kidnapping, torture and murder in 1985 in Guadalajara, Mexico, will answer for his crimes,\" Tarentino said.",
      "Camarena joined the DEA in 1974, the year after its founding.",
      "For more than four years in Mexico, Camarena investigated the country's biggest marijuana and cocaine traffickers.",
      "In early 1985, reportedly close to unlocking a multibillion-dollar drug pipeline, Camarena was kidnapped while headed to meet his wife. The agent's capture and subsequent murder were dramatized in Netflix's \"Narcos: Mexico.\""

      "The filing stated that almost 5,800 USAID awards for future work, and approximately 4,100 distributed through the State Department, will be terminated, while around 500 USAID awards and roughly 2,700 State Department awards will be retained.",

      "Two of the 170 migrants recently held there describe the conditions on the base.",
      "When Jose, a Venezuelan migrant who was seeking asylum in the United States, was awoken by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official at 2:30 a.m. on Feb. 8, he sensed he was being sent to Guantanamo Bay, home of the notorious U.S. prison camp that administration officials said would house the most violent \"worst of the worst\" migrants apprehended on American soil.",
      "\"When we got on the [military] plane, they put restraints on our hands, feet, and waist,\" said Jose, who requested that his last name not be used out of fear of retribution. \"They searched us and then sat us in a chair, tying us to it and binding our feet together. We hoped it wouldn't be Guantanamo but in the end, that's where we ended up.\"",
      "Jose is one of the more than 170 migrants who spent two weeks at the naval base before being sent to Venezuela. He told ABC News that while he had a suspicion he was being sent to Guantanamo, he claims U.S. officials never told him and the other migrants where they were being sent.",
      "\"Our minds were racing, thinking we were kidnapped, wondering who would get us out of there,\" said Jose. \"Because no one tells you anything.\"",
      "Jose told ABC News that he had traveled to Mexico's northern border to wait for an asylum appointment that he requested through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection app, prior to it being shut down by the Trump administration. After three weeks of waiting and \"no food or a place to stay,\" he decided to surrender to authorities at the U.S. southern border. He was detained at a detention center until he was transferred to Guantanamo.",
      "ABC News spoke with Jose and another Guantanamo detainee, Jhoan Bastidas Paz, in Spanish, and reviewed court testimonies from three other detainees about their experience on the naval base before they were released. They allege U.S. officials transferred them to Guantanamo despite their having no criminal records, and several claim they were denied phone calls with their attorneys and relatives despite repeated demands.",
      "\"From the moment we were there, we tried to kick the doors, we went on countless strikes,\" Jose said. \"We clogged the toilets and protested, we covered the cameras because the confinement is unbearable.\"",
      "Jose told ABC News the room in which he was placed had \"cobwebs and a disgusting smell.\" He said that he spent 10 days without a mattress.",
      "\"They give you food ... but it's like they don't give you any, [it's] very little food,\" Jose said. \"There came a point where I would lick the plate. The food had no salt, but I would still eat it as if it were very tasty, because I was hungry.\"",
      "Jose said he and the other detainees were only allowed outside twice in two weeks and were denied phone calls with their relatives and families.",
      "\"There are four cages outside,\" Jose said. \"That's the yard. You leave one room to go into another cell.\"",
      "Representatives from the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Bastidas Paz had surrendered to authorities after crossing the U.S. southern border from Mexico in 2023. He was charged with \"improper entry\" to which he pleaded guilty, and was in a detention center in El Paso, Texas, until he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay.",
      "Both Jose and Bastidas Paz told ABC News they are not members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, despite the U.S. government saying they are.",
      "\"We're not from Tren de Aragua or anything, we're not criminals, we're immigrants,\" Bastidas Paz said. He said that officials never told him he was being sent to Guantanamo and then to Venezuela.",
      "\"I don't think it's fair that they're taking us there, like that, with lies, because practically we're being taken there, kidnapped, without telling us anything, and when we realize it, they leave us there, and I don't think it's fair,\" Bastidas Paz said.",
      "Bastidas Paz told ABC News that he went on a hunger strike with other detainees while they demanded information from officials. He also claims he was only allowed to shower three times during the time he was in Guantanamo.",
      "\"We are immigrants and we haven't committed any crime to be taken to that very ugly prison,\" Bastidas Paz said.",
      "Jose said he has not been able to sleep since he arrived in Venezuela.",
      "\"I haven't slept at all because of the fear that I might fall asleep and ... I'd wake up back there,\" he told ABC News. \"That's the terror I feel.\"",

The election comes after federal job cuts carried out by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency with a goal of slimming down a bloated federal government and reducing its jobs -- many of which are stationed in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs of Virginia.",

Glenn Youngkin winning the election and flipping the governor seat after Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's time in the governors mansion.

      "ABC News reached out to Virginia's Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running against Spanberger for governor, about the federal job cuts in Virginia and its effect on the race, but did not hear back by the time of publication.",
      "In response to the federal layoffs and the impact on Virginia workers, Youngkin announced a new state website to help people find jobs in the commonwealth, including those impacted by the Trump administration's federal cuts.",
      "The new website, called virginiahasjobs.com, displays 250,000 jobs available across the state.",
      "Although Youngkin said he has empathy for those who have lost their jobs through the Trump administration's slashing of federal jobs, the Virginia governor -- a Trump ally -- said he supports the idea of trying to cut out waste and fraud from government.",
      "\"Listen, we have a federal government that is inefficient, and we have an administration that is taking on that challenge of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse and driving efficiency in our federal government. It needs to happen,\" Youngkin said.",
      "Earle-Sears, whom Youngkin recently endorsed, amplified the resources announced by the Virginia governor through releases, campaign messaging and social media posts.",
      "But some say it's too early to tell if these cuts could impact the upcoming elections in Virginia.",
      "Zack Roday, a Virginia-based GOP consultant who ran the coordinated campaign for Spirit of Virginia -- Youngkin's PAC, told ABC News that Democrats seizing on the cuts of the federal government means they're looking for a message to carry them through this cycle.",

Youngkin's record, his approval is popular, both with the electorate writ large and certainly the important independents that have a big role in determining who's the next governor,\" Roday continued.",
      "Roday also added that there are people in Virginia who support the Trump administration's cuts.",
      "\"There's a whole lot of Virginians that live outside of Richmond and Northern Virginia, and have a lot of people that look at what Donald Trump is doing and are saying about time, thank you,\" Roday said.",

      "Many Ukrainians fear that a hastily negotiated peace \u2014 especially one that makes too many concessions to Russian demands \u2014 would allow Moscow to rearm and consolidate its forces for a future invasion after current hostilities cease.",
      "According to the preliminary economic agreement, seen by The Associated Press, the U.S. and Ukraine will establish a co-owned, jointly managed investment fund to which Ukraine will contribute 50% of future revenues from natural resources, including minerals, hydrocarbons and other extractable materials.",
      "A more detailed agreement on establishing the fund will be drawn up once the preliminary one is signed.",
      "Trump has framed the emerging deal as a chance for Kyiv to compensate the U.S. for wartime aid sent under Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "But Zelenskyy has remained firm that specific assurances for Ukraine\u2019s security must accompany any agreement giving U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s resources. On Wednesday, he said the agreement \u201cmay be part of future security guarantees, but I want to understand the broader vision. What awaits Ukraine?\u201d",
      "Trump remains noncommittal about any American security guarantees.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to make security guarantees ... very much,\u201d Trump told reporters this week. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have Europe do that.\u201d",
      "If a truce can be reached, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed to send troops for a potential peacekeeping mission to Ukraine to ensure that fighting between Ukraine and Russia doesn\u2019t flare up again. Both leaders traveled to Washington this week before the Zelenskyy visit to discuss with Trump the potential peacekeeping mission and other concerns about the war.",
      "White House officials are skeptical that Britain and France can assemble enough troops from across Europe, at least at this moment, to deploy a credible peacekeeping mission to Kyiv.",
      "It will likely take a \u201cconsensual peace settlement\u201d between Russia and Ukraine before many nations would be willing to provide such forces, according to a senior Trump administration official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House.",
      "Zelenskyy and European officials have no illusions about U.S. troops taking part in such a mission. But Starmer and others are trying to make the case that the plan can only work with a U.S. backstop for European forces on the ground \u2014 through U.S. aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, as well as rapid-response cover in case the truce is breached.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve created a moment of tremendous opportunity to reach a historic peace deal \u2014 a deal that I think would be celebrated in Ukraine and around the world,\u201d Starmer told Trump. \u201cThat is the prize. But we have to get it right.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy has been vague on exactly what kinds of security guarantees would be suitable for his country, and while he continues to advocate for Ukraine\u2019s eventual membership in NATO, he has also suggested a similar security arrangement would suffice.",
      "But Trump on Wednesday said Ukraine \u201ccould forget about\u201d joining the Western military alliance.",
      "Still, Zelenskyy\u2019s meeting with Trump, their first since the U.S. leader's inauguration in January, is seen in Kyiv as a diplomatic win for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said being able to meet personally with Trump before Russian President Vladimir Putin does \u201cis a good signal.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said he hopes to discuss whether the U.S. plans to halt its military aid to Ukraine and, if so, whether Kyiv would be able to purchase weapons directly from the U.S.",
      "He also wants to know whether Ukraine can use frozen Russian assets for the purchase of weapons and whether Washington plans to lift sanctions on Moscow.",
      "Fears that Trump could broker a peace deal with Russia that is unfavorable to Ukraine have been amplified by recent precedent-busting actions by his administration. Trump held a lengthy phone call with Putin, and U.S. officials met with their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia without inviting European or Ukrainian leaders \u2014 both dramatic breaks with previous U.S. policy to isolate Putin over his invasion.",
      "Trump later seemed to falsely blame Ukraine for starting the war, and called Zelenskyy a \u201cdictator\u201d for not holding elections after the end of his regular term last year, though Ukrainian law prohibits elections while martial law is in place.",
      "As Zelenskyy seeks to lower the temperature with the U.S. while in Washington, American officials are saying the economic deal, if implemented, would itself provide a measure of security to Ukraine through the presence of U.S. investments on its territory.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said the U.S. working on mineral extraction in Ukraine would amount to \u201cautomatic security because nobody\u2019s going to be messing around with our people when we\u2019re there.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great deal for Ukraine too, because they get us over there and we\u2019re going to be working over there,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will be on the land.\u201d",
      "That perspective is echoed by the text of the economic agreement, which says the U.S. \u201csupports Ukraine\u2019s efforts to obtain security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.\u201d",
      "Washington, it continues, has \u201ca long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine.\u201d",

      "A stretch of Interstate 40 through the western North Carolina mountains is reopening to traffic this weekend, months after Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding collapsed portions of the road",
      "WAYNESVILLE, N.C. -- A stretch of Interstate 40 through the western North Carolina mountains is reopening to traffic this weekend, months after Hurricane Helene\u2019s historic flooding collapsed portions of the road, partially restoring the major travel connection with eastern Tennessee.",
      "The state Department of Transportation said the 20-mile (32-kilometer) section on the North Carolina side of the border will officially reopen on Saturday. Flooding in the Pigeon River gorge in Haywood County washed away over 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of I-40\u2019s eastbound lanes in late September.",
      "Although usually a four-lane road, large portions of the section will operate for now with just one narrowed lane in each direction, with a 35 mph (56 kph) speed limit, according to the state Transportation Department. A concrete curb separates traffic, and periodic breaks provide access to emergency vehicles.",
      "Gov. Josh Stein announced Feb. 10 that I-40 traffic would reopen by March 1.",
      "\u201cThis opening improves the flow of people, goods and services between our two states and between locations far beyond Haywood County,\u201d regional DOT engineer Wanda Payne said in a news release this week. The release said that travelers on the stretch of I-40 should expect delays, especially on holiday weekends and on Friday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and suggested they still consider alternate interstate routes.",
      "While I-40 across the Tennessee line reopened months ago to traffic almost to the North Carolina border, one-lane-only sections also will extend into Tennessee to complete the connection, North Carolina DOT said.",
      "North Carolina government had hoped to restore traffic on I-40 in early January, but that got delayed when more asphalt from eastbound lanes fell in mid-December. Contractors worked to stabilize what\u2019s left of the road by driving long steel rods into bedrock below the road, filling them with grout and spraying concrete on the cliff face to hold them in place.",
      "North Carolina government has already entered a contract for the road's permanent reconstruction. Transportation Secretary Joey Hopkins told state lawmakers this week it would be late 2026 before the section can resume fully to four lanes, provided that stone can be quarried from the adjoining Pisgah National Forest. Otherwise, he said, it could take two to three additional years longer, because trucks will have to ship stone in from Tennessee.",

    "story": [
      "New laws in Florida mandate stiffer criminal penalties for immigrants in the U.S. illegally than for everyone else",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- For most people in Florida, misdemeanor theft can result in up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. For an immigrant illegally in Florida, that same crime now carries a felony punishment of up to five years behind bars and a $5,000 fine.",
      "The new laws in Florida come as President Donald Trump cracks down on illegal immigration. They impose harsher penalties for offenses committed by people illegally in the U.S. than for everyone else. The consequences are particularly stiff for first-degree murder, which now carries an automatic death sentence for anyone who is in the U.S. illegally.",
      "While Florida is more aggressive than most, there are other states considering similar measures to enhance criminal penalties based on immigration status.",
      "Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis says \u201cFlorida will be safer and securer,\u201d and a model for other states, because of its sweeping immigration laws.",
      "The stiffer penalties are meant to be a deterrent, Republican state Rep. Lawrence McClure said.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t come to the state of Florida illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the premise.\u201d",
      "Some civil rights advocates and legal experts are raising alarm.",
      "The laws are \u201cleading into a head-on collision with the constitutional guarantee of equal protection to everyone who is in the United States,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, a law professor at Ohio State University who specializes in immigration and criminal law.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump ordered a renewed emphasis on the death penalty. His executive order highlighted two particular grounds for it: murdering a law enforcement officer or committing any capital offense while in the U.S. illegally. But jurors and federal judges would still decide whether to impose the death sentence.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 ruled North Carolina's mandatory death sentence for first-degree murder violated the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. States since then have generally used court proceedings in which jurors first decide guilt, then weigh aggravating and mitigating factors when deciding whether defendants should be sentenced to death.",
      "\u201cThere is longstanding precedent making clear that mandatory death penalty laws are unconstitutional,\u201d said Kara Gross, legislative director and senior policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida.",
      "But Florida\u2019s new laws eliminate judicial discretion in certain cases. They require courts to impose a death sentence on defendants in the U.S. illegally who are found guilty of capital offenses such as first-degree murder or child rape.",
      "Republican state Sen. Randy Fine acknowledged the legislation he co-sponsored will likely face a legal challenge, but he expects the Supreme Court to overturn its prior ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost 50 years later,\" Fine said, adding, \u201cThe Supreme Court changes its mind on things.\u201d",
      "Last year, DeSantis signed a law enhancing penalties for people who commit state felonies after being previously deported and convicted of illegal reentry under federal law. The measure increased sentences by one classification, meaning someone convicted of a third-degree felony typically punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine would instead be sentenced for a second-degree felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "The latest Florida laws apply similar sentencing enhancements to anyone in the U.S. illegally, regardless of any convictions for reentering, and apply the enhanced penalties to misdemeanors.",
      "If the new laws get challenged, Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said, a court would likely look to a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The justices said Texas failed to show a substantial state interest for a law barring state school funding for children not \u201clegally admitted\u201d to the U.S. The high court cited the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which says a state shall not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d",
      "To defend Florida's law, state attorneys would probably have to answer a similar question: \u201cWhat is your compelling justification for treating individuals who are accused of a crime \u2014 the same crime \u2014 differently based solely on their citizenship status?\u201d Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.",
      "Legislation pending in several states \u2014 including Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Minnesota, South Carolina and Texas \u2014 would allow enhanced penalties for some state crimes committed by immigrants illegally in the U.S., according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "A bill by Texas state Sen. Pete Flores would raise penalties one notch for most felonies committed by people in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Flores, who is chair of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee and co-founder of the Texas Hispanic Republican Caucus, described the legislation as \u201ca common-sense, tough-on-crime response to enforce the rule of law and better protect Texans.\u201d",
      "Legislation that passed the Utah Senate and is now pending in the House takes a more narrow approach focused on theft and drug dealing. It would impose mandatory jail sentences, without the potential for early release, for repeat offenders who are lawful U.S. residents or for any offenders who were previously deported and then convicted in federal court of illegally reentering the U.S.",
      "Republican state Sen. Cal Musselman said his legislation targets \u201ca small group of individuals.\u201d Law enforcement officers have told him they see \u201ca clear connection between being deported multiple times, coming in, and committing crimes within the state.\u201d",

      "The Georgia Court of Appeals has thrown out pending criminal charges against two men convicted of concealing the death of teacher Tara Grinstead",
      "FITZGERALD, Ga. -- An appeals court has thrown out pending criminal charges against two men previously convicted of concealing the death of Georgia teacher Tara Grinstead, whose 2005 disappearance baffled her family and investigators for more than a decade.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that the statute of limitations had expired when prosecutors in rural Ben Hill County charged the men with crimes stemming from the burning of Grinstead's body in a rural pecan orchard two decades ago.",
      "Prior convictions in the case weren't affected. Ryan Duke was found guilty in 2022 in Irwin County, where Grinstead lived, of concealing her death. But a jury acquitted him of murder. His friend with a similar last name, Bo Dukes, was also convicted of covering up the killing in 2019. Both are serving prison sentences.",
      "Grinstead, a 30-year-old high school teacher and former beauty queen, vanished in October 2005 from her small hometown of Ocilla. Her face loomed large on a billboard seeking tips in her disappearance until arrests were made in February 2017.",
      "That's when Duke confessed to investigators that he had broken into Grinstead's home to steal money for drugs. Duke told Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents that he became startled when Grinstead appeared behind him and that he struck and killed her.",
      "Both Duke and Dukes told investigators that they burned Grinstead\u2019s body after moving it to the pecan grove in Ben Hill County. But Duke recanted his confession to killing her on the witness stand at his murder trial. Instead he blamed Dukes, testifying that he lied to police because he was afraid and intoxicated. Dukes was never charged with murder.",
      "Two weeks after the 2022 trial, a grand jury in Ben Hill County indicted Duke on additional charges related to Grinstead's death including a new count of concealing a death, hindering apprehension of a criminal and evidence tampering. Dukes still faced similar charges filed in the same county in 2017.",
      "Under Georgia law,, prosecutors had a four-year window to bring charges in the Ben Hill County case once they had probable cause to make arrests. Prosecutors asserted that clock started with the men's February 2017 confessions. A lower court agreed with them.",
      "But the Court of Appeals ruled the clock started ticking in November 2005, roughly a month after Grinstead went missing, when a man reported to a sheriff's office that Duke and Dukes told him at a party that they had killed Grinstead and burned her body.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that law enforcement had probable cause to arrest the two men by late November 2005,\u201d the court's ruling said.",
      "Police contended they lacked sufficient evidence to make arrests in late 2005, when they searched the pecan orchard based on the man's tip but found no sign of Grinstead.",
      "Nevertheless, the appeals court ruled that the four-year time limit expired long before either man was charged in Ben Hill County.",
      "Duke is serving a 10-year prison sentence for concealing Grinstead's death in Irwin County. Dukes, who was also convicted of lying to police, was given 25 years in prison.",
      "Grinstead's body was never found. Duke in 2017 led investigators to the pecan grove in Ben Hill County where he said the body was burned. Investigators recovered bone fragments that experts later testified were consistent with one adult. However, DNA analysis was inconclusive."

    "story": [
      "Students at Michigan State University's law school have found that slavery is still baked into American jurisprudence",
      "EAST LANSING, Mich. -- An 1842 U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning the kidnapping conviction of a white man who seized a Black family and forced them into slavery south of the Mason-Dixon line is still being cited in American jurisprudence, 160 years after enslaved people throughout the U.S. were freed.",
      "Prigg v. Pennsylvania has been cited in 274 other rulings since then, according to the Citing Slavery Project at Michigan State University. They are among more than 7,000 direct citations of slavery-law precedents that continue to guide lawyers and judges, said the project's director, law professor Justin Simard.",
      "This research into the lasting impact of legal principles related to the ownership of other humans is a counterpoint to efforts by the Trump administration and elected officials in Republican-led states to remove references to America's racial history and dictate what teachers can discuss in classrooms.",
      "\u201cBecause people are invested in trying to pretend that our history of slavery didn\u2019t happen and that its effects are not still with us,\u201d Simard told The Associated Press, \u201cI thought, what better way to prove that slavery had an influence on our legal system than using official legal sources?\u201d",
      "Most of the slavery precedents concern how property rights were protected by the U.S. Constitution, which was written by wealthy property owners in an era when much of the young nation\u2019s economy was powered by the buying and selling and sweat of enslaved people.",
      "The Supreme Court made slavery's importance to the America's founding clear when it ruled that Pennsylvania's anti-slavery law was an unconstitutional affront to the federal Fugitive Slave Act, and ruled in favor of Edward Prigg, who had forced Margaret Morgan and her children into slavery in Maryland.",
      "The U.S. Constitution clearly granted \u201cto the citizens of the slaveholding states the complete right and title of ownership in their slaves, as property, in every state in the Union, into which they might escape from the state where they were held in servitude,\u201d the court wrote.",
      "The slaveowner\u2019s right to \u201cthis species of property\u201d was so fundamental to the framers of the Constitution that without it, \u201cthe Union could not have been formed,\u201d the justices added.",
      "Slavery became illegal when the 13th Amendment was adopted in 1865, but Prigg has been most often cited in the decades thereafter, mostly in cases involving property law, as guidance regarding the boundaries between state and federal power, Simard said.",
      "The continuing use of such citations shows that slavery wasn't just a historic stain that the 13th Amendment cleaned up \u2014 these precedents have an insidious effect on jurisprudence even today, said Leonard Mungo, a Michigan-based civil rights and employment discrimination attorney.",
      "\u201cThe unashamed use of human beings as property and as the foundation for the development of jurisprudence regarding property law is the same reason courts across this country rarely find violations of civil rights in employment and other contexts in its rulings and decisions,\u201d Mungo said.",
      "And it's not like only minorities are affected: Prigg was cited in a 1989 Supreme Court decision overruling most of the $850,000 judgment awarded by a Texas jury to a white football coach who alleged that he was reassigned and demoted from a mostly Black high school because of his race.",
      "Sometimes, slavery precedents are invoked in efforts to reaffirm civil rights. In a 2016 Iowa Supreme Court opinion, dissenting justices said people arrested but not yet formally charged with a crime must be allowed private in-person attorney consultations. Citing how Fugitive Slave Act enforcement shaped the Iowa Constitution, these justices said enslaved people were given the right of counsel \u2014 and so should an Iowa man accused of driving under the influence. They were outvoted, 4-3.",
      "Simard was doing research for his dissertation when he began compiling evidence that northern judges had cited slave cases in the 19th century. He discovered that these citations were more numerous, widespread and recent than he imagined.",
      "\u201cI kept digging and digging and digging and realizing that this wasn\u2019t something just one judge did or some very racist judge or something,\u201d Simard said. \u201cThis was just a basic feature of the legal system and it really shocked me, really surprised me.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 slavery rulings have been identified to date by Simard's team, which then searches for citations.",
      "And yet many lawyers and judges are either unaware of these origins or don\u2019t think it matters that enslaved humans were the property in question, and consider them \u201cjust like regular law,\u201d Simard said. \u201cNot only are we ratifying their treatment as property in the past but also continuing to treat them as property in the present.\u201d",
      "Simard\u2019s team successfully lobbied the editors of The Bluebook, a guide to citations used by the legal profession, to require case notations such as \u201censlaved party\u201d or \u201censlaved person at issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think just eliminating these cases is impossible,\u201d Simard said. \u201cI think the best approach that lawyers and judges can take is to be thoughtful when they find these cases and cite these cases and to consider whether the law that these cases stand for is still good or not.\u201d",
      "Dylan Penningroth, a professor of law and history at the University of California-Berkeley, agreed.",
      "\u201cThese slavery cases are everywhere,\u201d Penningroth said. \u201cHow are we ever going to get them all off the book? One answer is you don\u2019t really have to. If lawyers stop relying on these cases, they lose their power.\u201d",
      "Identifying those cases should keep their origins and intents on the minds of judges and litigators, according to Michigan Appeals Court Judge Adrienne Young. She said, \u201cthe real harm is in failing to acknowledge the horrific history.\u201d"

      "A Baltimore judge is weighing whether to reduce Adnan Syed's murder sentence to time served, allowing him to remain free even though murder conviction still stands",
      "BALTIMORE -- More than a decade after Adnan Syed\u2019s murder case attracted massive interest through the hit podcast \u201cSerial,\u201d a Baltimore judge is considering a request to reduce his sentence to time served, which would allow him to remain free indefinitely even though his conviction still stands.",
      "Both prosecutors and defense attorneys told Judge Jennifer Schiffer that Syed doesn\u2019t pose a risk to public safety. Schiffer also heard from the victim\u2019s family, who urged her uphold Syed\u2019s sentence.",
      "After several hours of testimony, Schiffer indicated that her written order will address Syed\u2019s recent accomplishments and the unimaginable suffering of the victim\u2019s family as well as the horrific nature of the crime. \u201cIt not my intention to leave everyone waiting for too long,\u201d she said.",
      "Syed, now 43, was released from a life sentence in 2022 after Baltimore prosecutors uncovered problems with the case and asked a judge to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, who was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave.",
      "With his conviction was temporarily vacated, Syed has been working at Georgetown University\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative and caring for aging relatives. His father died in October.",
      "But challenges from Lee\u2019s family led to his conviction being reinstated by the Maryland Supreme Court for a procedural reason \u2014 so that the victim\u2019s family could get proper notice of the hearing that freed him from prison.",
      "The judge acknowledged the \u201clengthy and frankly tortured history of this case.\u201d She described how the grief of Lee\u2019s family has been compounded through decades of litigation and intense media attention.",
      "Syed, however, is not the same person he was at age 17, she said.",
      "\u201cHe has changed. He has matured, and he has had some success in society,\u201d Schiffer said.",
      "Lee never had the chance \u201cto do any of these things,\u201d she added.",
      "The emotional testimony included character witnesses who described Syed as having an even temper, strong communication skills, loving relationships and an impressive ability to remain hopeful during 23 years behind bars.",
      "Eric Simmons, an exoneree who was incarcerated with Syed for many years, said he demonstrated a level of humanity and compassion from the very beginning of his prison term.",
      "\u201cIn a place that is referred to as the belly of the beast, Syed showed people, including myself, that you don\u2019t have to act like an animal even though you\u2019re incarcerated,\u201d he said.",
      "But Lee's family and their attorney urged the judge to honor Syed\u2019s conviction and uphold his sentence. They said the recent proceedings \u2014 starting in 2022 when they were shocked to learn of Syed\u2019s abrupt release \u2014 have ripped open old wounds.",
      "Lee\u2019s younger brother, Young Lee, said he endured the pain of sitting through Syed\u2019s original trial. When it was finally over, he said, the guilty verdict meant his sister \u201ccould finally rest in peace.\u201d Learning of the state\u2019s efforts to throw out Syed\u2019s conviction left him in shock, wondering if prosecutors were still on the family\u2019s side, he said through tears.",
      "When he was finished speaking, the judge offered an apology: \u201cI am so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through, and all I can say is that your words are not lost on me, and my heart goes out to you,\u201d she told him.",
      "In a videotaped statement speaking in Korean, Lee\u2019s mother questioned the integrity of the American criminal justice system that she believed had solved her daughter\u2019s murder 25 years ago. She said she took comfort in Syed\u2019s conviction even as she struggled to maintain her will to live.",
      "\u201cThose who commit a crime should pay the price,\u201d she said.",
      "Syed became choked up talking about how the Lee family has suffered. He said he\u2019s trying to keep his head down and contribute positively to society.",
      "\u201cI just acknowledge their pain. I don\u2019t mean to cause more pain for them,\u201d he said. \u201cI try my best to live a good life, because that\u2019s what I owe to everyone.\u201d",
      "Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many questions remain unanswered even after the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives.",
      "Rife with legal twists and turns, the case has recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a growing movement to acknowledge and correct systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps."

      "Musk defended his weekend attempt to require government workers to justify their prior week\u2019s work under penalty of termination \u2014 a move that drew pushback from many in the room on national security and privacy grounds \u2014 as merely a \u201cpulse check\u201d to ensure that those working for the government have \u201ca pulse and two neurons,\" adding that \u201cthis is not a high bar\u201d for workers to meet.",

      "He cited as an example that, while hustling to dramatically shrink the U.S. Agency for International Development, \u201cOne of the things we accidentally canceled very briefly was Ebola prevention.\u201d Musk insisted that \u201cthere was no interruption\u201d in services before the funding was restored.",
      "But a USAID official said Wednesday that no funds for the agency\u2019s Ebola response had been released under President Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 funding freeze for foreign aid, including for efforts to combat the spread of the deadly virus.",
      "After about 15 minutes of focus on Musk and DOGE, Trump shifted the spotlight of the Cabinet meeting back to his own accomplishments in his first weeks in office.",
      "The Cabinet sat mostly silently for more than an hour, as Trump opened the floor to questions from an invited group of reporters.",
      "Asked if he expected his Cabinet to follow his directives without exception, Trump initially scoffed at the question before answering, \u201cof course, no exceptions.\u201d",

      "The Georgia State Election Board has voted to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to enforce a subpoena against a conservative group that had alleged ballot stuffing in the state after the group was unable to produce evidence to support its claims",
      "ATLANTA -- The Georgia State Election Board on Wednesday voted to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to enforce a subpoena against a conservative group that was unable to produce evidence to support its claims of ballot stuffing in the state.",
      "Texas-based True the Vote in 2021 filed complaints with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, including one in which it said it had obtained \u201ca detailed account of coordinated efforts to collect and deposit ballots in drop boxes across metro Atlanta\u201d during the November 2020 election and a crucial runoff election for two U.S. Senate seats in January 2021.",
      "Investigators with the secretary's office looked into the group's complaints and in April 2022 subpoenaed True the Vote for evidence supporting its allegations. A lawyer for the group wrote to a state attorney in May 2023 that a complete response would require it to identify people to whom it had pledged confidentiality and said it was withdrawing its complaints.",
      "Then-State Election Board chair William Duffey responded that the group had made \u201cserious allegations\u201d and that he wouldn't allow the complaints to be withdrawn. He asked the state attorney general's office to enforce the subpoenas, and the board filed a lawsuit.",
      "A Fulton County judge in November 2023 ordered True the Vote to provide evidence it had collected, including the names of people it said had provided information. The organization said in a subsequent court filing it had no names, contact information or other documentary evidence to provide. The case was administratively closed in January 2024.",
      "Election Board member Janice Johnston on Wednesday proposed dismissing the lawsuit, withdrawing the subpoena and dismissing the group's complaint. She said it is apparent that an alleged whistleblower whom True the Vote said it was relying on for evidence \u201cwill not be identified or cannot be identified\u201d and that the investigation was unlikely to be successful as a result.",
      "After a brief discussion, the board voted to approve Johnston's proposal.",
      "Catherine Engelbrecht, president of True the Vote, said in an emailed statement that the organization welcomes the dismissal of the case, which she described as \u201ca legal dispute that never should have begun.\u201d She said the organization \u201cremains committed to our mission.\u201d",
      "True the Vote's allegations that people engaged in ballot stuffing in Georgia were relied upon heavily for \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d a widely debunked film by conservative pundit and filmmaker Dinesh D\u2019Souza to cast doubt on the results of the 2020 presidential election. A State Election Board investigation found that surveillance camera footage used in the film showed people submitting ballots for themselves and family members who lived with them, which is allowed under Georgia law.",
      "D'Souza in December issued a statement saying \u201cinaccurate information\u201d was provided to him about ballot box surveillance video and apologizing to a Georgia man who was falsely accused of ballot stuffing in the film. Previously, in May, Salem Media Group, the publisher of \u201c2000 Mules,\u201d also publicly apologized to the same man."

      "A state judge tossed out racketeering charges against New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and those charged alongside him",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- A state judge on Wednesday agreed to toss out racketeering charges against New Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and those charged alongside him.",
      "Superior Court Judge Peter Warshaw granted Norcross' and other defendants' motion to dismiss a state grand jury's indictment on racketeering charges brough by Attorney General Matt Platkin.",
      "Platkin said in a statement he plans to appeal the judge's ruling.",
      "The charges stem from a June 2024 indictment, announced by Platkin at a news conference at which Norcross himself took the unusual step of appearing at in person and sitting directly in front of the attorney general. The charges accused Norcross and five other defendants of running \u201can enterprise\u201d going back to 2012 to use their political influence to craft legislation to serve their own interests.",
      "In a nearly 100-page ruling, the judge found the prosecution's allegations did not amount to criminal coercion or extortion and are time-barred.",
      "\u201cDefendants correctly argue that when considering private parties negotiating economic deals in a free market system, threats are sometimes neither wrongful or unlawful. In these situations, there may be nothing inherently wrong in using economic fear to obtain property,\u201d Warshaw wrote.",
      "Among the allegations against Norcross were charges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property in Camden, New Jersey, on Norcross\u2019 terms. The indictment cites a profanity-laden phone recording of Norcross in which he tells the developer he will face \u201cenormous consequences.\u201d The person asks if Norcross is threatening him, according to the indictment. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Norcross replies.",
      "The indictment also said Norcross and the co-defendants extorted and coerced businesses with property rights on Camden\u2019s waterfront and obtained tax incentive credits, which they then sold for millions of dollars. Platkin described Camden as long suffering from economic decline.",
      "At the time, defense lawyer Michael Critchley had accused Platkin of having a \u201cvendetta\u201d against Norcross, noting that the waterfront development had been investigated for years by several agencies, including federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey, as well as Platkin\u2019s predecessor.",
      "Those investigations came to nothing, Critchley said.",
      "Norcross, who served as executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, had been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state.",
      "He was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party. A close friend to the former state Senate president, he was a behind-the-scenes power player and well-known financial backer to Democrats in the state and nationwide.",
      "In addition to dismissing the indictment against Norcross, the judge's order applied to his brother and co-defendant Philip A. Norcross, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross\u2019s longtime lawyer William M. Tambussi; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd; Sidney R. Brown, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O\u2019Donnell."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it",
      "SEATTLE -- President Donald Trump's effort to suspend the system for resettling refugees in the U.S. is on hold after a federal judge in Seattle blocked it. U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, found that while the president has broad authority over who comes into the country, he cannot nullify the law passed by Congress establishing the program.",
      "The Justice Department indicated it would consider a quick appeal, saying Trump's actions have been well within his authority.",
      "Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Trump halted the nation's refugee resettlement program as part of a series of executive orders cracking down on immigration, saying cities had been taxed by \u201crecord levels of migration\u201d and couldn't \u201cabsorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.\u201d He barred refugees from coming to the U.S., and the administration began cutting off funding for agencies that support refugees.",
      "The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution \u2014 a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It is different from asylum, by which people newly arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.",
      "Despite long-standing support from both parties for accepting refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years. Trump also temporarily halted it during his first term, and then dramatically decreased the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. each year.",
      "There are 600,000 people being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world, according to the administration.",
      "The lawsuit filed in Seattle was brought by individual refugees whose efforts to resettle in the U.S. have been halted as well as major refugee aid groups.",
      "Those organizations include International Refugee Assistance Project on behalf of Church World Service, the Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS and Lutheran Community Services Northwest. They say they have had to lay off staff because the administration froze funding for processing refugee applications overseas as well as support, such as short-term rental assistance for those already in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe resettled people days before the inauguration that were just cut off from benefits,\u201d said Lutheran Community Services Northwest CEO David Duea said after Tuesday's hearing. \u201cThat means rent, helping kids get into school, and case management. It was an inhumane act.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer August Flentje disputed the notion that the plaintiffs had suffered the sort of \u201cirreparable\u201d harms that would warrant granting a broad order blocking the administration\u2019s actions. Most people whose travel to the U.S. was canceled at the last minute had already been moved to a third country where they were out of danger, he said, and the cancellation of funding for refugee aid groups amounted to a contract dispute.",
      "The judge disagreed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve read the declarations,\u201d Whitehead said. \u201cI have refugees stranded in dangerous places. I have families who have sold everything they\u2019ve owned in advance of travel, which was canceled.

      "Now that House Republicans have passed an ambitious budget blueprint for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, its time for hard work",
      "WASHINGTON -- Now that House Republicans have passed an ambitious budget blueprint for President Donald Trump's agenda, its time for the hard work of turning ideas for $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion of slashed spending into a bill that lawmakers warn could bring intense changes to Americans back home.",
      "Republicans are insisting the costs of the tax breaks be partly paid for by the steep reductions in federal government spending as a way to ensure the nation's $36 trillion debt load doesn't not balloon to dangerous levels.",
      "But deciding what to cut \u2014 health care, food stamps, green energy, government regulations or student aid \u2014 is a politically agonizing choice.",
      "And it's not just the House that has to agree. GOP senators have their own plans. Their priority is to make the tax cuts permanent, rather than temporary, which would skyrocket the costs. Eventually the House and Senate must vote on a final package.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of hard work ahead of us,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the late Tuesday vote.",
      "It's the start of a weeks \u2014 if not months \u2014 long slog that is expected to consume the Congress as Republicans try to deliver on Trump's agenda and their own campaign promises.",
      "Republicans say if they fail to act, the lower tax rates first approved in 2017 will expire, which would amount to a massive tax hike for many Americans. They believe the tax cuts will partly pay for themselves, unleashing economic growth and fresh revenues, though others say those projections are optimistic.",
      "Democrats put up stiff opposition against the House GOP plan \u2014 one lawmaker dashed from California after a week\u2019s stay in the hospital and another returned to Washington for the vote with her newborn son. Democrats will spend the weeks ahead warning Americans what's at stake.",
      "\u201cRepublicans and Trump promised to lower costs on day one, and instead their priorities have been focused on ripping health care away from kids, moms and others who need it most,\u201d said Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo., cradling her 4-week old son, Sam.",
      "\u201cAll to fund tax breaks for billionaires like Elon Musk while increasing our national deficit by trillions of dollars,\" she said. \"How can anyone show their face in their district after voting yes for this?\u201d",
      "Trump, during a free-wheeling Cabinet meeting Wednesday at the White House, insisted he will not touch the nation's premier safety net programs \u2014 Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security \u2014 but seek ways to root out what Republicans call waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be \u2018read my lips\u2019 anymore,\u201d Trump said, echoing President George H.W. Bush's no new taxes pledge. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "But the math doesn't fully add up.",
      "Without steep cuts to federal programs, Republicans won't be able to claim the savings they need to offset the costs of the tax breaks. And without offsetting the costs, conservative GOP lawmakers won't want to vote for the final package.",
      "GOP senators on Wednesday met behind closed doors with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on next steps.",
      "Initially approved during Trump's first term, many of the tax cuts were temporary and are expiring later this year. Keeping them would cost $4.5 trillion over the next decade \u2014or more if they are made permanent as Senate Republicans want.",
      "And that's not counting the new tax cuts that Trump is asking for. The president wants to eliminate taxes on tips, which was a signature campaign promise, and has also talked about getting rid of taxes on overtime pay as well as Social Security benefits. Those would add to the price tag.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it\u2019s \u201cto be determined\u201d when the Senate would act on the House budget resolution.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\" Thune said. \"It\u2019s hard. Nothing about this is going to be easy.\u201d",
      "With reductions to the Pentagon off the table, Republicans are hunting for cost cutting across the non-defense side of the budget. The next biggest pot of money available is the nation's health care programs.",
      "The House GOP's bill directed the committee that handles Medicaid health care spending to come up with $880 billion in savings over the decade, which would be the bulk of what's needed to offset the cost of the tax breaks.",
      "Republicans insist there will be no direct cuts to people who receive their health care through Medicaid, some 80 million adults and children, and that they only will target waste, fraud and abuse to make it more efficient.",
      "Mostly, Republicans talk about imposing work requirements or removing able-bodied men from the government-run Medicaid program. Doing that would save a small portion of what's needed, some $100 billion over the decade.",
      "For a bigger savings, Republicans consider altering the way the federal government provides Medicaid money to the states. Some 40 states expanded their Medicaid programs with the Affordable Care Act, when Obamacare provided money to enroll people in the program.",
      "The Republicans have also directed the House Agriculture Committee to come up with some $230 billion in savings. One likely place it will turn is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. GOP chair Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania said food stamps won't be cut.",
      "Democrats are having none of this, and advocacy groups have started showing up at town hall meetings to protest what's happening.",
      "\u201cThe enormity of program cuts called for by the House budget stand as a singular threat to the well-being of people in every state, city, and rural community,\u201d Sharon Parrott, president of the center-left Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a statement after the vote.",
      "As Senate Republicans push to make the tax cuts permanent, chair of the Senate Finance Committee Mike Crapo has leaned into the idea of using a different accounting process.",
      "It involves essentially treating the tax cuts as what's called \u201cexisting policy,\u201d which would mean they are not a new cost, and therefore would not need to be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
      "But Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Finance committee, said Republicans are engaging in \u201cfunny math.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all a big game in order to get more money to the billionaires through their tax breaks,\u201d Wyden said.",
      "Thune, Johnson, Crapo, and Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., chair of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, are scheduled to headed to the White House on Wednesday for discussions with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "At the same time, key GOP senators are still pushing their smaller $340 billion package to provide the Trump administration with money it needs for border security and its mass deportation agenda. Their idea was to include the tax cuts in a second package later in the year."

Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is proposing opening a U.N. office that would provide drones, fuel, ground and air transportation and other non-lethal support to a Kenyan-led mission in Haiti struggling to fight gangs, according to a letter obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "The letter was sent to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday night and provides the first details for a proposal that Guterres announced last week at a summit with Caribbean leaders. At the time, Guterres said he would request that the U.N. assume funding for the mission\u2019s structural and logistical expenses but did not provide further information.",
      "In the letter, Guterres assessed the situation in Haiti and warned it was running out of time.",
      "\u201cWe must act quickly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am convinced that the phased approach of the United Nations' support\u2026 can reverse the shocking and rising trend in gang violence.\u201d",

      "The proposal comes as gangs that already control 85% of Haiti\u2019s capital seized new neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince in recent weeks. The attacks have left more than 6,000 people homeless in the past month, according to the U.N.",
      "\u201cEntire families were killed in their homes, while others, including children and babies, were shot dead as they tried to escape,\u201d the U.N. said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Guterres said in the letter that the U.N. office he proposes could help strengthen Haiti\u2019s National Police and help gather, store and share sensitive information related to operations, as well as provide a joint operations center, GIS support and surveillance via drones.",
      "In turn, Guterres said BINUH, the latest U.N. political mission in Haiti, could focus on priorities including designing programs to help children and women forced to join gangs defect from them, as well as support authorities in the arrests and prosecutions of \u201chigh-risk individuals.\u201d",
      "The Security Council previously extended the U.N.-backed mission in Haiti led by Kenyan police to October of this year even as the U.S. and other countries warn it is lacking personnel and funding.",
      "Guterres noted in his letter that while the mission has reached 1,000 personnel, the vast majority of them Kenyan police, it still only represents 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned.",
      "In addition, a U.N. trust fund that is helping fund the mission has only $110.8 million.",
      "\u201cMuch more is needed,\u201d Guterres wrote.",
      "He also noted that \u201cmany\u201d of the mission\u2019s armored vehicles are ill-equipped for the urban environment in Port-au-Prince and that a lack of spare parts has rendered half of all its combat vehicles inoperable.",
      "Last year, more than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti, 1,000 more deaths than reported the previous year. Gang violence also has left more than one million people homeless in recent years, according to the U.N.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said it is eliminating more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world, putting numbers on its plans to eliminate the majority of U.S. development and humanitarian help abroad.",
      "The cuts detailed by the administration would leave few surviving USAID projects for advocates to try to save in what are ongoing court battles with the administration.",
      "The Trump administration outlined its plans in both an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press and filings in one of those federal lawsuits Wednesday.",
      "The Supreme Court intervened in that case late Wednesday and temporarily blocked a court order requiring the administration to release billions of dollars in foreign aid by midnight.",
      "Wednesday's disclosures also give an idea of the scale of the administration's retreat from U.S. aid and development assistance overseas, and from decades of U.S. policy that foreign aid helps U.S. interests by stabilizing other countries and economies and building alliances.",
      "The memo said officials were \u201cclearing significant waste stemming from decades of institutional drift.\u201d More changes are planned in how USAID and the State Department deliver foreign assistance, it said, \u201cto use taxpayer dollars wisely to advance American interests.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk have hit foreign aid harder and faster than almost any other target in their push to cut the size of the federal government. Both men say USAID projects advance a liberal agenda and are a waste of money.",
      "Trump on Jan. 20 ordered what he said would be a 90-day program-by-program review of which foreign assistance programs deserved to continue, and cut off all foreign assistance funds almost overnight.",
      "The funding freeze has stopped thousands of U.S.-funded programs abroad, and the administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams have pulled the majority of USAID staff off the job through forced leave and firings.",
      "Widely successful USAID programs credited with containing outbreaks of Ebola and other threats and saving more than 20 million lives in Africa through HIV and AIDS treatment are among those still cut off from agency funds, USAID officials and officials with partner organizations say. Meanwhile, formal notifications of program cancellations are rolling out.",

Chris Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "A coalition representing major U.S. and global businesses and nongovernmental organizations and former officials expressed shock at the move. \u201cThe American people deserve a transparent accounting of what will be lost \u2014 on counterterror, global health, food security, and competition,\u201d the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition said.",
      "The State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had reviewed the terminations.",
      "In all, the Trump administration said it will eliminate 5,800 of 6,200 multiyear USAID contract awards, for a cut of $54 billion. Another 4,100 of 9,100 State Department grants were being eliminated, for a cut of $4.4 billion.",
      "The State Department memo, which was first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, described the administration as spurred by a federal court order that gave officials until the end of the day Wednesday to lift the Trump administration\u2019s monthlong block on foreign aid funding.",
      "\u201cIn response, State and USAID moved rapidly,\u201d targeting USAID and State Department foreign aid programs in vast numbers for contract terminations, the memo said.",

Officials were processing a few million dollars of back payments, officials said, owed to U.S. and international organizations and companies.",

      "Latvia\u2019s foreign minister is warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he hasn\u2019t been able to accomplish in his war against Ukraine \u2014 weaken the United States and restore control over his smaller neighbor",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Latvia's foreign minister warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will try to achieve in peace talks what he hasn\u2019t been able to accomplish in his war against Ukraine \u2014 weaken the United States and restore control over his smaller neighbor.",
      "Baiba Bra\u017ee spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday during a week of intense diplomacy between Europe and the United States following President Donald Trump\u2019s upending of U.S. policy with his decision to hold direct talks with Russia, while excluding Ukraine and its European allies from the initial discussions.",
      "Bra\u017ee notes that Russia, with a population of 140 million, has managed to gain control of less than 20% of Ukraine, population 40 million, since it seized Crimea in 2014 and launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Putin has failed to weaken the U.S. and the NATO military alliance it leads, or to oust the democratic government in Kyiv.",
      "So, when it comes to seeking peace, \u201cI think the difficulty is with the Russians, because Russians are the ones who want to weaken U.S. power, and who want to weaken the U.S. in the world overall,\u201d Bra\u017ee said.",
      "What the world is seeing, she said, is that when Putin interferes in other countries he wants to control both territory and the political choices of their governments. In Syria, for example, he supported the authoritarian regime of Bashar Assad and got military bases on the Mediterranean.",
      "But Putin hasn't gotten what he wanted during the three-year war in Ukraine and \u201che will try to get it through the peace talks,\u201d Bra\u017ee said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to clearly remember that perspective in whatever deal we negotiate or strike.\u201d",
      "She said although only U.S. and Russian officials took part in last week's talks in Saudi Arabia, \u201cEurope is included\u201d in the peace discussions because of constant communications with both the Ukrainians and the Americans. She has been in Washington three times since mid-December and said she was heading there later Tuesday for talks with lawmakers and administration officials.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump at the White House on Monday, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was due to meet with him on Thursday.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed that Europe\u2019s task now is to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and build up its own militaries and defense industries.",
      "Last week, Latvia announced it will increase defense spending to 4% of GDP next year and continue to move toward 5%. NATO members have agreed to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense.",
      "\u201cWe are investing in our own capability,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wish all Europeans would do that. That\u2019s one of the issues we are discussing.\u201d",
      "As NATO members, Bra\u017ee said, Latvia and the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia and Lithuania need to make sure they are prepared for any future aggression from Russia. She said their focus is on deterrence \u2014 early warning, rapid response, military capability and political will.",
      "The three Baltic states were occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II and fell under Soviet control after the war. Like Ukraine, they became independent countries with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
      "Bra\u017ee stressed Monday to the U.N. Security Council that \u201conly Ukraine\u2019s victory can ensure lasting security and put an end to Russia\u2019s imperialist aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe strongly believe that a rushed ceasefire will not lead to sustainable peace; instead, it will only embolden Russia, encouraging further expansion and putting global security at grave risk,\u201d she said.",
      "Macron said he had spoken to 30 European and allied leaders, with some saying they are willing to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine in a peace deal.",
      "Bra\u017ee said that while there have been preliminary discussions, there is no peace process yet.",
      "When there is, she said, \u201cWe will be guided very much by the needs of Ukraine.\"",
      "\u201cFor any security force, we need military guidance,\u201d Latvia's top diplomat said. \u201cWe need military advice. What type of force is there? Where? Are the troops withdrawn on the Russian side from the contact line? How far? What is the location of any security force?\"",
      "But Bra\u017ee said the most important thing is peace must be long-lasting, not just a ceasefire where war can restart again. \u201cNobody wants that,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "Flat owners are being hit with huge bills for fire safety work because their blocks are not tall enough to qualify for funding announced after the Grenfell Tower fire.",
      "The previous government launched the Building Safety Act after the 2017 fire which killed 72 people. But the rules do not apply to buildings under 11m (36ft) or five storeys high.",
      "Some lawyers claim the new law was \"rushed\" but the government says it covers the majority of leaseholders and it will continue to review the legislation.",
      "Paramedic Tom DeRonde received a \u00a365,000 bill because his flat is in a three-storey building and says he faces bankruptcy.",
      "\"I had to take a month off work with stress. There's not been a day when I've not thought about cladding,\" he told the BBC.",
      "It is estimated there are 1.3 million leasehold flats in low-rise blocks, under 11m high in England, according to the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign.",
      "Tom bought his flat in Luton in 2018 with money he had saved from serving in the army. He said when he came home to a bill for \u00a365,000 he was \"absolutely shocked\".",
      "The invoice from his landlord was his legal share of the costs to make the building fireproof. \"I thought it was a typo to be honest,\" said Tom.",
      "Then he learnt the building's height meant he was a \"non-qualifying leaseholder\" and would be liable to pay for fire safety work.",
      "\"The government says for buildings under 11m, the risk can be mitigated by other means, like using fire alarms and sprinkler systems but in my case, that's not true,\" explained Tom.",
      "\"I've had two fire assessments both saying the cladding is dangerous and needs to be removed, and the price, which they also said would be lower for smaller buildings, is extortionate. I can't pay,\" he added.",
      "After complaining to the building's owners, Tom expects the bill to be reduced but is yet to find out by how much.",
      "Tom had planned to sell the flat to buy a family home but can't. \"It's ruining my life and I'm facing bankruptcy,\" he said.",
      "The Department for Housing told the BBC that owners of buildings under 11m should not pass on the costs of fixing historical safety defects to leaseholders.",
      "But the law does not prevent people like Tom being billed for unlimited amounts of money when the developers are no longer around or landlords cannot afford the remediation costs.",
      "'Falling through the gaps'",
      "Liz Ramsden is an expert in leasehold property at Knights and told the BBC she believes the Building Safety Act was drafted too quickly.",
      "\"The intention was that no leaseholder would have to pay but in reality we are finding a lot of leaseholders are having to pay huge sums of money.",
      "\"There was very little consultation and because of that we have these gaps in the legislation and people are falling through,\" she said.",
      "Even in buildings above 11m the rules fail to protect many leaseholders.",
      "Homeowners with Islamic mortgages or three or more properties also do not benefit  from the full protections.",
      "This is something Martin Batty, who has an Islamic mortgage, only discovered when he put his one-bedroom flat up for sale.",
      "He said his lawyer explained the way Islamic home purchase plans are structured - to comply with Sharia law which does not allow paying interest - means he falls outside the scope of the act.",
      "\"It feels really unfair. I feel like I'm being discriminated against,\" he said.",
      "\"To find out that I'm a non-qualifying leaseholder just because I've got an Islamic home purchase plan is a huge kick in the teeth. It's really upsetting and is a huge let down.\"",
      "The government told the BBC Islamic interest free loans secured against properties were very rare.",
      "But Martin said he can't sell his flat because mortgage providers will not lend against it and solicitors won't advise on non-qualifying leases.",
      "Suzy Spilling and her husband Colin invested in four rental properties to fund their retirement - including two flats in Salford \"mortgaged to the hilt\".",
      "These two flats are in a building where lots of the cladding has been found to be unsafe.",
      "The government will fund the removal but because the couple have more than three properties they too are non-qualifying leaseholders and will have to pay towards the costs of making the tower block fire-safe.",
      "\"Everything we have planned for would be out the window,\" said Suzy. \"How were we going to raise the funds needed? We could be on the hook for \u00a3100,000 for each of our two apartments.\"",
      "It is estimated there are 385,000 flats in England owned by non-qualifying leaseholders like Suzy and Colin, according to the End Our Cladding Scandal.",
      "The couple have gone back to work to save money \"but there's no way we're going to be able to cover the amount we're going to have to pay,\" she added.",
      "\"Our lives are on hold. We don't know when it's ever going to end.\"",
      "Lawyer Mrs Ramsden said: \"There's been a 40% drop in leasehold transactions because of problems with the act. It urgently needs to be looked at so we can make it work better for everybody.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",

    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",

      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "The US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a \"dictator\".",

      "However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was \"inclined to go along with it\".",

      "After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed \"very quickly\".",
      "Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US  would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,\" he said.",
      "He said the UK and US had shaped the \"great technological innovations of the last century\" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century.",
      "\"Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,\" he said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union.",
      "He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.",
      "Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: \"He tried.\"",
      "\"He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" he said.",
      "\"I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\"",
      "In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was \"fair, balanced and reciprocal\".",

    "summary": "Public urged to respond to commission on fixing system in England and Wales - but chairman rules out nationalisation.",
    "story": [
      "The public, environment groups and investors are being asked for their views about how the water sector can be changed by a body set up by the UK government.",
      "The head of a new independent commission will invite ideas on how to fix England and Wales' troubled water industry.",
      "Sir Jon Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, will launch his call for evidence in Manchester on Thursday morning.",
      "There has been growing public anger about water company performance amid massive sewage leaks and soaring bills, and the commission is looking for views on reform.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has said the water sector in England and Wales \"urgently needs fixing\".",
      "Reed has ruled out nationalisation, saying it would cost up to \u00a3100bn, and that waterways would continue to be polluted while private ownership structures were unpicked.",
      "Instead, the government wants private investment to upgrade the sewerage system and reservoirs.",
      "To get that, regulator Ofwat has allowed the water industry to raise bills, which will go up by an average of \u00a3123 a year from April.",
      "There were 3.6 million hours of sewage spills into England's lakes, rivers and seas by water companies in 2023, which is more than double the amount of the previous year.",
      "Sir Jon said there were \"serious\" and \"interlocking concerns\" with the sector which need \"ambitious changes\", and acknowledged that \"trust in the system\" had \"broken down on all sides\".",
      "He said there had been \"poor decisions and poor performance by companies, regulatory gaps, policy instability and a history of ad-hoc changes that have left an increasingly complex system that is no longer working well for anyone\".",
      "But he said these problems were not the \"inevitable\" consequence of privatisation.",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "Thames Water secures \u00a33bn lifeline after court ruling",
      "The water industry is in crisis. Can it be fixed?",
      "The government established the independent water commission promising the biggest shake up of the sector since privatisation 35 years ago.",
      "Sir Jon is expected to recognise the widespread dissatisfaction at multiple failings and will seek submissions from regulators, investors, industry leaders and the public on potential reforms.",
      "He will acknowledge the tensions between different regulators, the increasing demands place on the system by climate and population growth, and making the sector attractive to private investors.",
      "Sir Jon told the BBC the commission's report would be \"as radical as we need to be to reset the system\".",
      "The plight of Thames Water has been one of the most high-profile issues in the sector, with the company struggling with about \u00a319bn of debt.",
      "It recently won a crucial High Court battle to secure a \u00a33bn rescue loan, staving off the prospect of the company coming under government control.",
      "Sir Jon's review comes as six companies - including Thames - are appealing against decisions by Ofwat to limit bill increases over the next five years.",
      "The commission's report, expected in June, will not affect that process.",
      "Sir Jon said regulation of the water sector would be a \"key area\" that the commission will examine.",
      "\"Regulation needs to balance the cost to the bill payers with the needs of investment, not just to ensure that we've got supply of clean water for the future, but also investment to protect the environment.",
      "\"There is probably a bigger role for government, both at the national and at the local level, for giving guidelines for how those priorities should be managed,\" he added.",
      "To try to make companies more accountable, the government has brought in a law which gives regulators the power to ban bonuses for water company bosses.",
      "In addition, executives who fail to co-operate or obstruct investigators could face prison sentences of up to two years.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to \"screw the United States\".",
      "\"We'll be announcing it very soon,\" he told reporters at an appearance with members of his cabinet. \"It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things.\"",
      "The European Union said it would react \"firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs\".",
      "Trump's appearance sparked questions about his trade plans, as he also appeared to raise the possibility that looming tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, set to come into force on 4 March, might be postponed again.",
      "An administration official later said the deadline remained in place, with the president planning to review Mexico and Canada actions related to border security over the coming days.",
      "Trump made clear on Wednesday that trade with Europe also remained in his sights, repeating his criticism of European policies, which he said put American exporters of food products and cars at a disadvantage.",
      "\"The European Union was formed to screw the United States - that's the purpose of it and they've done a good job of it,\" he said.  \"But now I'm president.\"",
      "The EU rejected the president's claims, saying the creation of a regional market had made doing business in Europe easier for American firms.",
      "\"It has been a boon for the United States,\" a spokesperson for the commission said. \"We're ready to partner if you play by the rules. But we will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.\"",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Tariffs are a tax on imports that is collected by the government and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.",
      "Trump has vowed to use the levies to boost US manufacturing, raise money and push other countries to change policies he opposes.",
      "But there are concerns such measures could fuel inflation, with warnings that Americans could face higher prices for goods as businesses may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.",
      "Since taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom \"reciprocal\" tariffs for each country.",
      "But he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats.",
      "\"The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research.",
      "\"It's a number that's concerning - certainly should be concerning - for the trans-Atlantic trade relationship, but not totally out of the blue.\"",
      "'Worried, not afraid'",
      "Antonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a \"difficult\" but \"not an impossible\" situation for Germany's economy.",

      "On Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect \"on schedule\".",
      "At Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April.",
      "That is the same day that the Commerce Department is supposed to deliver its wider recommendations for \"reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that \"the overall is April 2\" , distinguishing between tariffs tied to concerns about drug trafficking and migration from Mexico and Canada.",

      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",

      "Other demonstrations included using it to book a taxi and a dinner reservation at a restaurant.",

    "summary": "The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has made headlines by pulling its most advanced data security tool for UK customers.",
      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",
      "ADP, meanwhile, applies an extra level of protection through what's known as end to end encryption, which means Apple cannot see or access the data - only the user can.",
      "Because Apple does not have a key, losing access to your account can mean losing your data altogether.",
      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",
      "The tool is independent of the protections for blue messages sent with iMessage, passwords stored in iCloud keychain, Health app data and Facetime, which are end to end encrypted by default.",
      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",
      "Your iCloud data will remain protected by standard encryption and, as before, can still be accessed by Apple.",
      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",
      "Meanwhile, people in the UK who had ADP enabled prior to Friday's change will lose access to it a later date.",
      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",
      "Some Samsung Galaxy smartphones also have \"enhanced data protection\" which encrypts back-ups of messages, call logs, apps and settings and more end to end.",

      "Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.",
      "Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.",
      "The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.",
      "\"I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,\" says.",
      "A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).",
      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",

      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",

      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",
      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",
      "Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.",
      "Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.",

    "story": [
      "While drinking tree sap does not immediately sound appealing, Canadian producers are hoping that it will be the next must-try soft drink around the world.",
      "We have all heard of maple syrup, which is made by boiling down the sap of maple trees to produce a thick, sweet, golden-to-brown coloured syrup that is typically poured over pancakes.",
      "What is far less well known is that you can drink the sap itself, which is called maple water. Clear in colour, it contains just 2% natural sugars, so it is only slightly sweet.",
      "A small but growing number of producers in Canada are now selling this maple water in bottles or cartons, after first giving it a filter and pasteurisation to kill off any microbes.",
      "\"People feel like they're drinking the wild Canadian forest,\" says Yannick Leclerc of Maple3, a producer of maple water drinks, based in Quebec City.",
      "Advocates point to the fact it is a natural drink, and makers hope that it can steal some sales from the existing similar product \u2013 coconut water. The latter is made from water that naturally forms inside coconuts.",
      "As Canada is far and away the world's largest producer of maple syrup \u2013 accounting for more than 80% of production \u2013 it is understandable that the nascent maple water sector is also Canadian. Furthermore, it is centred on the province of Quebec, which makes 90% of Canada's maple syrup.",
      "Mr Leclerc says that Maple3 is one of the pioneers of the sector. \"Nobody [previously] thought about keeping the sap for its hydration purposes verses just boiling it into syrup.\"",
      "He joined the company back in 2016, three years after it was founded by his business partner St\u00e9phane Nolet. In recent years an increasing number of other producers have entered the marketplace.",
      "Mr Leclerc claims that Maple3 has doubled its annual profits since 2021, with sales not just rising across Canada, but in 12 other countries, including France, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Some 75% of its sales now come from overseas, and it sells both still and sparkling maple water, and fizzy versions with added natural fruit flavourings.",
      "\"It's more than just a local product at this point,\" adds Mr Leclerc.",
      "For the maple water industry as a whole, one recent report predicts big growth. It estimated that global sales in 2024 totalled $506m (\u00a3409m), with that expected to jump to $2.6bn by 2033.",
      "By comparison, worldwide sales of coconut water reached $7.7bn in 2023, with that expected to grow to $22.9bn by 2029. So maple water has a long way to catch up.",
      "Meanwhile, the global value of the maple syrup market was $1.7bn last year, according to one study.",
      "Beth Czerwony, a dietician with the non-profit medical centre Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, says the growing popularity of maple water is linked to its perceived health benefits.",
      "\"When the sap itself is filtered through the tree, it ends up absorbing a bunch of antioxidants,\" she says. \"So they're gonna end up having a better performance and a faster workout recovery.\"",
      "However, one medical study from 2019 concluded that maple water was \"was not superior in rehydration\" to normal water.",
      "Jeremy Kinsella owns The Soda Pop Bros in Windsor Ontario, which sells soft drinks under its own brand name, as well as imports from around the world.",
      "His family have been in the industry for nearly a century, and in his lifetime he has seen a fair share of trends come and go.",
      "He says that if maple water is to go mainstream it needs the financial backing and promotion of one of the huge global soft drinks firms.",
      "\"It will take a larger soda manufacturer for it to really catch on,\" he says.",
      "Mr Kinsella also says that the price of maple water is currently too high. \"When it comes down to it, someone's looking at a can of Coke for a buck and they're looking at a can of maple water for three bucks, they're going to try it a couple of times and go back to Coke,\" he says.",
      "Marketing maple water more would certainly help it increase sales, says John Tomory, who helps run Pefferlaw Creek Farms in Uxbridge, Ontario. He and his brothers have been making maple syrup commercially for almost 10 years, and for the past four they have also been selling the sap to a Canada brand called Sap Sucker. This makes sparkling sap water with different added flavours, from lime to grapefruit, and lemon to orange.",
      "Mr Tomory says he agrees with this approach to make the sap more interesting. \"I know a lot of people have tried just selling the sap as it is, just basic sap from the tree and it's still, but they haven't really caught on,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think carbonating it and adding fruit flavour makes it more interesting. That's the real innovation.\"",
      "Back at Maple3 in Quebec, Mr Leclerc also thinks that the sparkling version of the drink could be the more popular: \"It has perks that a normal sparkling water doesn't have,\" he says, such as a more interesting flavour, without having all the bad stuff that [regular] soda has.\""

    "story": [
      "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",
      "The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.",
      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",
      "He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\".",

      "She said: \"It is important to distinguish today's statistics on S4 leavers from overall progress made to close the attainment gap in Scotland.",
      "\"There are clearly positive signs for the future as we are seeing a record low poverty-related attainment gap in primary school literacy and in S3 literacy and numeracy.",
      "\"While it is disappointing that the attainment gap has widened slightly at SCQF Levels 4, 5 and 6, it's important to note that we have reduced the gap between the most and least deprived young people entering positive destinations by two thirds since 2009-10, the second lowest gap on record.\"",
      "Gilruth added that the number of school leavers at S4 had remained stable, and that the government was exploring reasons why teenagers chose to leave school at that time.",
      "Scottish Conservative education spokesman Miles Briggs said: \"After years of insisting that education is their priority, the SNP have been missing in action while ministers have let down pupils and teachers at every turn.",
      "\"Under John Swinney's government, it's our most deprived students who now face the narrowest options and the worst prospects.\""

    "summary": "From April, a pilot scheme will offer free breakfasts for 180,000 pupils before class.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced the first 750 schools to provide free daily breakfast clubs as part of a pilot scheme ahead of a planned England-wide rollout.",
      "Starting in April, 180,000 pupils in England will be offered \"healthy, varied and nutritious breakfasts\" in schools before class, Labour said - with over a third of schools in the pilot scheme in deprived areas.",
      "But some MPs and head teachers' unions have raised concerns the funding is too low.",
      "Labour campaigned on a promise of free breakfast clubs in every English primary school and later tripled funding to \u00a330m.",
      "Cautious welcome for free school breakfast clubs",
      "Free school meals 'would tackle child poverty'",
      "Parents will be able to drop off children 30 minutes before their usual school time, knowing they will be offered a free breakfast, the government says.",
      "Shadow Education Minister Neil O'Brien told the House of Commons there were \"a number of questions\" about the plans, including \"the difference in the planned spend and the much larger benefits ministers are claiming\".",
      "Analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the funding proposed for the breakfast clubs could be enough to fund all primary school pupils under a food-only model, or 60% of pupils if it had some childcare element.",
      "O'Brien questioned how the education secretary was planning to close that funding gap.",
      "But Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told the House of Commons she was \"confident\" the funding would be adequate.",
      "One in seven schools involved in the pilot had no before-school provision already in place, Phillipson said, and the rest either have paid-for provision or have their numbers capped.",
      "\"These breakfast clubs that we are introducing will be free to every child and every parent who seeks to take them up,\" she said.",
      "Phillipson did not confirm when the national rollout of the scheme would take place, but said it would be \"as soon as possible\".",
      "'Really worried'",
      "The Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Pepe Di'Iasio  said head teachers were \"really worried\"  the basic daily rate of just 60p per pupil was far too low.",
      "\"We strongly urge the government to be more realistic about the costs involved, before it attempts to roll out this policy nationally,\" he said.",
      "The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) has welcomed the news but also voiced concern that funding could fall short.",
      "\"It will be crucial that these concerns are addressed before the programme is rolled out across the country, to ensure that it does not place further pressure on already strained school budgets,\" said NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman.",
      "Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\".",
      "Devon tops the list with 25 schools in the programme, followed by England's largest local authority, Birmingham, with 24.",
      "Both Wales and Scotland have programmes to provide free breakfasts to children in primary schools.",
      "Guidance sent to schools taking part in the pilot scheme says they will receive a set-up payment to cover equipment and material.",
      "Under the scheme, schools will then be reimbursed by the government based on attendance at the clubs - a school with 50% participation in the pilot scheme could get \u00a323,000 a year, the government said.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g007jjlyqo",
    "published": "Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:24:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The 2025 Brit Awards are upon us - so who will win, and who'll give the biggest performances?",
    "story": [
      "The biggest night in British music is upon us, as the Brit Awards gear up for their 45th edition.",
      "Charli XCX leads the nominations this year, with five in total - including artist of the year and album of the year, all thanks to her critically-acclaimed, trend-setting album Brat.",
      "The Essex-born singer will attend the show but, surprisingly, is not expected to perform. Instead, there'll be big numbers from Ezra Collective, Sam Fender, Lola Young, Ezra Collective and Teddy Swims.",
      "An eclectic set of nominations also sees recognition for The Beatles, a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder, and and a Christmas song by Eurovision star Sam Ryder and hits by TikTok stars like Artemas and KSI.",
      "Here's what you need to know ahead of the ceremony.",
      "1) A mega night for Charli XCX",
      "It might not have been year's biggest-selling album, but Charli XCX's Brat spawned the most conversations.",
      "Released in June, it combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she'd accumulated, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "As authentic as it was catchy, Charli's seventh album introduced her to a whole new audience.. and brought her a clutch of Brit nominations.",
      "Earlier this week, organisers announced she'd won songwriter of the year - earning the star her first ever Brit award (she'd received nominations before in the best female and best pop act categories).",
      "That sets the scene for her to dominate tonight's show. If she wins everything she's nominated for, she'll tie with Raye as the most-awarded artist in a single Brits ceremony.",
      "2) A show-stopping performance from Sabrina Carpenter",
      "Sabrina Carpenter gave one of the best performances at last month's Grammy Awards.",
      "Arriving on stage in a sparkly tuxedo dress, she rearranged her hits Espresso and Please Please Please in a jazzy big band style, and even delivered a fleet-footed tap dance sequence.",
      "Better still, she turned the whole performance into a screwball comedy - missing her cues, dropping her cane, and accidentally knocking over her set.",
      "A former Disney star, she sold it all with a cheeky nod and a wink, undercutting the ceremony's more self-serious acts (The Weeknd, we're looking at you).",
      "Hopefully the singer will deliver something equally Short N Sweet when she pops into the Brits ahead of her UK tour.",
      "3) A possible tribute to Liam Payne",
      "Liam Payne had a huge connection to the Brits, both as part of One Direction and as a solo artist, so it's likely that the ceremony will include a tribute to the star - who tragically died in Argentina last October.",
      "Gossip columns have speculated that his former bandmates would reunite to honour his memory, but with Liam and Zayn both on tour, that seems unlikely.",
      "According to The Sun, the tribute will be \"a strong section of the show and not simply an In Memoriam name-check\".",
      "Quoting an unnamed source, the newspaper said: \"His family aren't involved in the plans but they are being kept in the loop.",
      "\"The Brits are treating it with the utmost respect and sensitivity.\"",
      "4) The return of Jack Whitehall",
      "It's four years since Jack Whitehall last hosted the Brit Awards, but his tenure was largely seen as a triumph - thanks largely to his willingness to poke fun at the stars in the audience.",
      "\"If you like Adele songs but find them too upbeat you're in for a treat,\" he said at the 2018 ceremony.",
      "\"Sam Smith will be performing.\"",
      "He's been honing his script for this year's ceremony over the Atlantic, jetting over from US filming commitments with less than 48 hours to go.",
      "But in a preview video, he was up to his old tricks, suggesting he should spray-paint himself orange to declare \"Make the Brits Great Again\".",
      "5) These records could be broken",
      "With 70 nominees across 13 categories, there are lots of records up for grabs this year. Here are some of the big ones.",
      "The Beatles are nominated for best single, for what's been billed as their \"last ever\" song, Now And Then. If they win, it will come a record 47 years after their first nomination in that category - for She Loves You in 1977.Coldplay could extend their lead as the winningest winners in the best group category. They already hold the record, with four victories in 2001, 2003, 2012 and 2016. Arctic Monkeys are their closest competitors, with three.Dua Lipa could become one of the top three most-awarded artists in Brits history. She currently has seven trophies, putting her in fifth place in the all-time league table. If she wins all four of her categories tonight, she'll leapfrog Take That and Coldplay to enter the bronze position.Billie Eilish could become the first foreign female to win best British single. She scores a nomination thanks to her chart-topping duet with Charli XCX, the underwear-fetishising club banger Guess.And if The Cure win best group, they'll set a record for the longest gap between wins in that category. The last time they got the award was in 1991, when presenter Roger Daltrey said he was relieved not to be giving the prize \"to a sampler or a drum machine\". Meow.",

    "summary": "The High Court says Ofcom's rulings over two shows hosted by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg were unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "GB News has won its judicial review of decisions made by TV watchdog Ofcom, that two shows hosted by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg breached the broadcasting code.",
      "The High Court judgment by Mrs Justice Collins Rice concluded that Ofcom's rulings were unlawful. It is the first time the watchdog has lost such a case.",
      "The judgement said Ofcom's initial rulings -  that the 9 May and 13 June 2023 broadcasts were in breach of its codes on \"due impartiality and due accuracy in news\" - were unlawful.",
      "GB News CEO Angelos Frangopoulos said the decision \"vindicates GB News' position as the fearless defender of free speech in the United Kingdom\", while Ofcom said it \"accepted the court's guidance\".",
      "'Fundamental failure'",
      "Mr Frangopoulos added: \"I call on the government and Parliament to consider the seriousness of this fundamental failure by Ofcom.\"",
      "The judge's ruling stated: \"I am minded to quash the two decisions in this case, and remit them to be reconsidered by Ofcom, subject to whatever further procedure may be fairly indicated.\"",
      "The court found that Ofcom had misapplied Rule 5.3 of the code, saying the provision only applies to \"news programmes\" and not to current affairs shows, such as the one Sir Jacob hosts.",
      "The decisions had been made as part of five GB News rulings by Ofcom in March last year, including three about shows hosted by Esther McVey and Philip Davies.",
      "Ofcom's rulings had said the State of the Nation shows hosted by Sir Jacob broke rules stating politicians should not usually front news coverage.",
      "The Ofcom code says a politician can't be a newsreader, interviewer or reporter in a news programme \"unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified\". They can, however, front current affairs shows.",
      "At the time, Sir Jacob was the Conservative MP for North East Somerset.",
      "Ofcom paying legal costs",
      "During the programmes, the \"host politicians acted as newsreaders, news interviewers or news reporters in sequences which clearly constituted news - including reporting breaking news events - without exceptional justification\", according to Ofcom investigations last year.",
      "The regulator concluded at the time: \"News was, therefore, not presented with due impartiality.\"",
      "But GB News responded to the rulings, saying: \"These decisions go against established precedent and raises serious questions about Ofcom's oversight over its own regulations.\"",
      "Ofcom said on Friday:  \"We accept the court's guidance on this important aspect of due impartiality in broadcast news and the clarity set out in its judgment.",
      "\"We will now review and consult on proposed changes to the broadcasting code to restrict politicians from presenting news in any type of programme to ensure this is clear for all broadcasters.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:16:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Fallout from the film about Gaza's children is a reputationally damaging mess, says the BBC's media editor Katie Razzall.",
    "story": [
      "As guests sat down on the red cinema-style seats in the screening room of a plush central London hotel, nobody could have imagined that, less than a month later,  the BBC would find itself forced to apologise for serious and unacceptable flaws in the documentary that was about to be shown.",
      "In the darkness, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone unfolded over an hour, telling in bleak and upsetting detail the story of Gaza's children over recent months of the war.",
      "Screenings are standard practice for media companies, primarily for outside press to review a programme ahead of broadcast.",
      "Also in the room was BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and other senior executives from the BBC's news and current affairs to view what one described as a \"landmark\" piece of filmmaking.",
      "But after the programme went out on BBC Two, it emerged that the child narrator at the heart of the film, 13-year old Abdullah, was the son of a Hamas government official. The outcry and accusations of anti-Israel bias and lack of transparency led the BBC to pull the film from iPlayer.",
      "Questions were asked in Parliament.",
      "'Fell short of expectations'",
      "Criticism continued about the programme's subtitling choices \u2013 including contributors using the Arabic word for \"Jews\" on camera, which was translated in the subtitles as \"Israelis\" or \"Israeli army\". Some argue that the BBC covered up antisemitism. Others have claimed the subtitles are closer to what the speaker intends rather than a literal translation.",
      "After an initial investigation, the BBC said the programme, which had been commissioned by the BBC and made by an outside production company, \"fell short of our expectations\".",
      "It launched a further review headed by the director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston. He will look at whether editorial guidelines were broken and whether anyone should be disciplined.",
      "It's a reputationally damaging mess, but how could it have happened? How did the commissioners of the programme not know that the child narrator's father was a deputy minister for agriculture in the Hamas-run government?",
      "The BBC says it had asked the production company \"a number of times\" in writing during the making of the film about any connections he and his family might have with Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation by the US, UK and others.",
      "In a statement on Thursday the BBC said Hoyo Films, the maker of the film, acknowledged it \"never told the BBC this fact\".",
      "But what did it tell the BBC about the child?",
      "Crucially, the BBC failed to uncover the information itself.",
      "Embarking on a documentary about one of the most polarising and contested issues of our age was always going to be challenging.",
      "The talented director at Hoyo, Jamie Roberts, has won an Emmy award for his film about the evacuation of Kabul. He's award-nominated for a powerful documentary about the events of 6 January in the US. He also made a searing film for the BBC about the Ukraine war.",
      "But he hadn't directed a documentary set in the Middle East before. He was working with the Palestinian journalist, Yousef Hammash, whose Gaza reporting for Channel 4 has won him a Bafta and an Emmy last year.",
      "The BBC commissioners in current affairs will have known the programme wasn't without risk.",
      "In circumstances like this, it's even more difficult to understand how the failings that have driven headlines for days - and done terrible damage to the BBC's reputation - could have occurred.",
      "Programme-makers and commissioners have previously told me they draw up risk grids to ensure they have the answers to any criticism thrown at them about their documentaries. They check and check and check to ensure they won't face problems after their programmes go out - or if they do, that they have the counter-argument ready.",
      "Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs until 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Media Show she would have done her own checks rather than relying on the independent company.",
      "\"If I was making this film, I wouldn't just ask who the boy was, who his father was, who his mother was, I would ask for the entire family tree. They could easily have found out about him, it shows that due diligence was not done.",
      "\"I didn't wait for people to inform me of things,\" she added. \"I asked them the right questions.\"",
      "Byrne says in her view the film isn't \"pro-Hamas\".",
      "Watching it, I was struck by the efforts at balance. It contains voices who curse the leaders of Gaza.",
      "BBC impartiality",
      "One of the children followed by the documentary, 11-year old Zakaria, says he doesn't like Hamas \"because they started the war, they caused all this misery, this is wrong\". A woman says \"they are causing us harm\". There's a conversation about why taking Israeli civilians hostage is wrong.",
      "But we also see the horrors and violence of what's taken place in Gaza -  through the eyes of children. Zakaria, who hangs around the hospital to help the paramedics rather than remaining with his family because, he says, there's no food and water where they are, tells the camera he thinks he's seen 5,000 dead bodies.",
      "Renat who's 10 and is building up a social media presence with an online cookery show, describes drones that shoot bullets. She smiles and laughs wildly on camera, as she describes, still clearly traumatised, how a bomb just exploded right next to her as she was walking outside her apartment.",
      "As the press release put it, the documentary is an \"unflinching and vivid view of life in a warzone\". It's the kind of programme Turness said, as the BBC apologised, that her department \"should be doing\".",
      "But she added \"Of course we have to get it right.\"",

    "story": [
      "The long-awaited first trailer for the new Shrek 5 film has been criticised by some film fans over the way characters have been animated, giving them different facial features.",
      "In the 27-second clip, recurring characters Shrek, Donkey, Pinocchio and Princess Fiona appear alongside Felicia - one of Shrek and Fiona's now grown-up children.",
      "The short teaser announces that Zendaya is joining the cast as Felicia, whilst also reintroducing Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy who are all reprising their roles.",
      "Oli Hyatt, who runs Blue Zoo Animation, told the BBC there's often \"an instant reaction\" when changes are made to a film like Shrek, due to its \"nostalgic properties\".",
      "Some users on social media have described the changes as \"disrespectful to the original art style\" and \"an AI interpretation of what Shrek 5 could look like\".",
      "Others have compared it to the film animation of video game character Sonic the Hedgehog, which Paramount Pictures changed after fan backlash in 2019.",
      "Hyatt added: \"The generation of children that watched Shrek back [when it was first released in 2001] are now adults.",
      "\"There's usually a feeling of 'this isn't what I knew' or 'I want the old show I remember back'\", he says.",
      "Hyatt, whose team contributed to The Adventures of Paddington and Lego City - No Limits, said that \"because the trailer is so short it's hard to tell how its going to look in general\".",
      "But, he added: \"You can see from a technical perspective, the advancement in technology.",
      "\"That means that on a similar or lower budget, you can producer a higher sheen and render quality, so it doesn't look quite as CGI (computer-generated imagery) and feels more tangible and real\".",
      "He doesn't feel like much has changed from the original \"art style\" of Shrek, but says \"the colours, vibrancy and realism\" have changed, which is a symptom of animation technology improving.",
      "In the short trailer, Shrek (Mike Myers), Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Felicia (Zendaya) gather round a magic mirror to ask \"Who's the fairest of them all?\".",
      "The face in the mirror, which also appears to have had a bit of a makeover, responds that it is Shrek, with images then flashed up on screen of Shrek wearing glasses and posing, then dancing in a skintight catsuit before appearing with rippling abdominal muscles.",
      "This pays tribute to some of the internet's favourite Shrek memes, whilst giving viewers a first look at the now grown-up Felicia, who first came to life in Shrek The Third in 2007, alongside her triplet siblings Fergus and Farkle.",
      "Shrek's return was teased at the end of the Puss In Boots sequel in 2022, so fans have been expecting this new film for quite some time.",
      "Its perhaps why the much-loved film has sparked so much pushback, with fans joking that Shrek looks like he's has had \"botox and a face lift\" whilst others have criticised the characters for having rounder faces.",
      "But not everyone has a problem with the new looks - some have praised the animators for ageing the characters with greying hair and wrinkles, whilst others say the updated animations are just a symptom of CGI improving.",
      "'Forgotten in two minutes'",
      "Hyatt said that despite the criticism that's been levelled at the trailer, he believes it will be \"forgotten within two minutes of watching the movie\".",
      "\"Shrek has never been about looking cute or beautiful, it's about being gross with all the jokes and silliness,\" he says.",
      "\"If they [the producers] have got the script right and the characters right, then people will still love it, it's still a great franchise.\"",

    "summary": "Three men are standing trial over the theft of the gold toilet which had been part of an exhibition.",
    "story": [
      "A man accused of stealing a \u00a34.8m golden toilet used it on a visit to Blenheim Palace the day before the heist, describing it as \"splendid\", a court has heard.",
      "The artwork, called America, was taken from the stately home in Oxfordshire in the early hours of 14 September 2019, two days after it went on display.",
      "Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, denies one count of burglary. Frederick Doe, 36, from Windsor and 41-year-old Bora Guccuk, from west London, both deny conspiring to transfer criminal property.",
      "Giving evidence, Mr Jones said he had visited the exhibition the day before and been \"at home in bed\" when the toilet was stolen.",
      "The 18-carat gold, fully-functional toilet was part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "The court previously heard Mr Jones had visited the palace twice before the theft.",
      "Prosecution barrister Julian Christopher KC  asked Mr Jones why he had taken a half-day off work on the Friday to visit the palace, rather than waiting until the weekend.",
      "Mr Jones admitted he did not often book half-days off work to go to museums and exhibitions but it was because he \"was interested to go and see it\".",
      "Members of the public booked slots to use the toilet in its cubicle as part of the exhibition.",
      "Photos he had taken were again listed to the jury and Jones said he took many of them because they were \"interesting\" views or pieces of art.",
      "One was of the window later broken to steal the gold toilet, jurors were told.",
      "A lock on the cubicle to the toilet was also photographed.",
      "Jones said it was because he thought it was \"quite funny that you could actually lock yourself in the toilet\".",
      "Questioned if he \"took advantage of\" the gold toilet's \"facilities\", he told the court that he did make use of it.",
      "Crispin Aylett KC, defence counsel for Mr Doe, asked Mr Jones \"what was it like?\"  and Mr Jones replied \"splendid\".",
      "A fourth man, James Sheen, 40, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, has previously pleaded guilty to burglary.",
      "Jones told the court he was friends with Sheen and that he worked as a roofer and general builder for Sheen's building firm.",
      "During his evidence he said that messages and voice notes between the two of them around the time of the heist were work-related or about a large dog kennel he was planning to help Sheen collect from Milton Keynes immediately after his visit to the exhibition.",
      "He denied that his two visits to the palace in the days before the raid were as reconnaissance for the robbery.",
      "He told the jury he went to the palace on 7 September to see a car show and again on the 13 September to see the exhibition.",
      "The toilet weighed 98kg and was insured for $6m (\u00a34.8m). Gold prices at the time would have seen the gold alone worth \u00a32.8m, the court heard.",
      "The palace is a Unesco World Heritage Site and was the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill.",

      "When Japanese journalist Shiori Ito decided to speak up about her rape allegations, she knew she would do so in the face of a society that prefers silence.",
      "\"I'm scared\u2026but all I want to do is to talk about the truth,\" she says, in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries.",
      "Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, of rape. He denies the charges.",
      "Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice, after authorities found insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.",
      "But there is one country where the documentary has still not been aired: Japan - where it has run into huge controversy.",
      "Shiori's former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage that she did not have permission to use, which, they maintain, has violated trust and put her sources at risk.",
      "She defends what she did as necessary for \"public good\".",
      "It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke. Then 28 years old, Shiori had chosen to ignore her family's request to remain silent about the alleged rape. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Yamaguchi - and won $30,000 (\u00a322,917) in damages.",
      "Shiori told the BBC making the film involved \"re-living her trauma\".",
      "\"It took me four years [to make the film] because, emotionally, I was struggling.\"",
      "She was an intern at Reuters news agency in 2015, when she claims Mr Yamaguchi invited her to discuss a job opportunity. At the time, he was the Washington bureau chief for a major Japanese media firm, Tokyo Broadcasting System.",
      "Shiori claims she was raped following a dinner in Tokyo with Mr Yamaguchi, who has always denied the allegations.",
      "CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel forms part of the more than 400 hours of footage which she has edited for the documentary.",
      "Shiori, who directed and wrote Black Box Diaries, describes the editing process as \"really challenging\".",
      "\"It was like hardcore exposure therapy,\" she says.",
      "But when the film was released, the CCTV footage included in the documentary became a source of friction between the director and the team of lawyers who had helped her win her civil case.",
      "The lawyers stated her use of CCTV footage was unauthorised - and that Shiori had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .",
      "Last week, her former lawyers - led by Yoko Nishihiro - held a press conference, in which she said Shiori's use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.",
      "\"If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,\" Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "Ms Nishihiro claimed Shiori also used unauthorised recordings in the film, which the lawyer only discovered following the screening of the film last July.",
      "The documentary included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower in relation to the investigation process, as well as video of a taxi driver who had provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape.",
      "Both the detective and the taxi driver, the lawyers have argued, were identifiable in the film - and neither had given their consent to be featured.",
      "\"I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,\"  Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "\"I want her to explain and be held accountable.\"",
      "Shiori has previously acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV footage, but has argued that it provided \"the only visual evidence\" of the night she claims she was sexually assaulted.",
      "She said including audio of the police detective was necessary because of \"the cover-up of the investigation\", and has insisted she was releasing the video \"for the public good\".",
      "\"We are standing in different points of view,\" she said, referring to her fall-out with her former lawyers.",
      "\"For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.\"",
      "There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. According to Shiori, \"Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]\".",
      "However, it remains unclear how far the lack of distribution might also be due to legal hurdles.",
      "In her most recent statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals could not be identified. She said a redacted version would be screened at a later stage.",
      "\"There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of - but I wanted to put all of it, and to show we are also human,\" she told the BBC.",

      "The women fighting Japan\u2019s sexual violence stigma",
      "Why is Japan redefining rape?",
      "In the nine years since the assault, Shiori's fight against Japan's justice system has been well-chronicled in the media - and is something she says she wanted to detail in her documentary.",
      "She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse.",
      "\"People were telling me you're not crying enough\u2026 you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.\"",
      "Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi  \u2013 they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety.",
      "Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from \"forcible sexual intercourse\" to \"non-consensual sexual intercourse\" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.",
      "Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: \"Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.\"",
      "For now it's unclear if her  film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize.",
      "\"This is my love letter to Japan. I really wish one day I can screen my film, and my family can also watch it,\" she added.",
      "\"That's what I really hope for\u2026 more than winning an Oscar.\""

      "The Oscars race, meanwhile, played out against the grim backdrop of wildfires which devastated Los Angeles and left thousands of homes destroyed.",
      "Awards season had its fair share of scandal. While The Brutalist's use of AI and Anora's lack of an intimacy co-ordinator were storms in a Twitter teacup, there was one genuine controversy when some historic tweets nearly brought down Emilia P\u00e9rez.",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), here are 17 of the quirks, trends, patterns, and record breakers from this year's batch of nominees.",
      "- - - - -",
      "1. This is the first time two musicals have been nominated for best picture in more than five decades.",
      "Wicked and Emilia P\u00e9rez are the first tuneful twosome to be up for the top prize since Funny Girl and Oliver! in 1969.",
      "The musical resurgence is partly down to it being twice as easy to score a best picture nomination nowadays, after the top category was expanded to 10 slots.",
      "The last musical to win best picture was Chicago in 2003.",
      "2. Adrien Brody already holds one Oscars record, and he could break another.",
      "The US star is currently the youngest ever winner of best actor - he was 29 when he won for his performance in 2002's The Pianist.",
      "But Brody wasn't nominated again until this year, with his nod for The Brutalist. If he wins again, he will become the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.",
      "Only seven other actors currently have a 100% win rate at the Oscars from two or more nominations - Vivien Leigh, Hilary Swank, Kevin Spacey, Luise Rainer, Christoph Waltz, Helen Hayes and Mahershala Ali.",
      "3. But Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is a major threat.",
      "The Dune and Wonka star is Brody's toughest competition in best actor, thanks to his acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "If he won, not only would Chalamet halt Brody's winning streak, he would also take Brody's record as the youngest-ever winner. There isn't much in it - Chalamet would be just 10 months younger than Brody was when he won.",
      "4. Netflix's Emilia P\u00e9rez could follow a dubious pattern for streaming films.",
      "It might have the most nominations, but the Spanish-language musical could share the same fate as other recent streaming films which were heavily nominated, but failed to follow through with many wins.",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominationsMank (Netflix) won two out of 10The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "The Irishman (Netflix) won zero Oscars, from 10 nominations",
      "Mank (Netflix) won two out of 10",
      "The Power of the Dog (Netflix) won one out of 12",
      "Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple) won zero out of 10",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez is strong in a couple of categories, but it's similarly unlikely to sweep the board.",
      "Only one streaming film has ever won best picture - Apple's Coda - which only had three nominations overall.",
      "5. Two Succession stars share a disadvantage.",
      "Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong are both nominated for best supporting actor, for their performances in A Real Pain and The Apprentice respectively.",
      "But the pair are the only two nominees in the category who don't come from best picture-nominated films.",
      "A Real Pain's absence in best picture shouldn't stop frontrunner Culkin from winning. The last person to win the category without a best picture nomination was Christopher Plummer in 2012, for Beginners.",
      "Every actor in the category this year is Oscar-nominated for the first time, except Edward Norton, who has three previous nods.",
      "6. The Substance is the first body horror to be nominated for best picture, and only the seventh horror overall.",
      "The other six were The Exorcist, Get Out, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense and Black Swan.",
      "The Substance is a strong contender in best make-up and hairstyling, a category where the winner often overlaps with the acting winners. That could work in Demi Moore's favour in a tight best actress race.",
      "7. Isabella Rossellini is nominated for an eight-minute performance in Conclave, but that isn't the shortest in Oscars history.",
      "Beatrice Straight won the same category, best supporting actress, for her role in Network, which lasted 5min 02sec.",
      "Dame Judi Dench is only marginally ahead, winning for a performance in Shakespeare in Love which lasted 5min 52sec.",
      "Winners aside, the shortest nominee is thought to be Hermione Baddeley's performance in 1959's Room at the Top, lasting 2min 19sec.",
      "On the subject of durations, The Brutalist (3hrs 35mins including an intermission) would be the fourth-longest best picture winner of all time, after Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.",
      "8. Sing Sing star Colman Domingo is nominated for best actor, just a year after his last nomination in the same category for Rustin.",
      "Quite an achievement, no doubt. But he has some way to go to catch up with Bette Davis and Greer Garson, who both managed five consecutive Oscar nominations in the 1930s and 40s.",
      "Just behind them are Al Pacino, Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Thelma Ritter and Jennifer Jones, who each scored four back-to-back nods.",
      "Bradley Cooper, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Russell Crowe, Glenn Close, Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, William Hurt, Richard Burton, Deborah Kerr, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Gary Cooper and Spencer Tracy all managed three in a row.",
      "9. All five best actress nominees come from films which are also nominated for best picture.",
      "That might not sound like much, but it's the first time it's happened since 1977.",
      "The historic lack of overlap between the two categories has often been attributed to the Academy being less likely to give female-focused films the top prize.",
      "But that trend has shifted in recent years, with films featuring female leads such as Nomadland, Coda and Everything Everywhere All At Once scoring best picture.",
      "10. Before Sebastian Stan's nomination for The Apprentice, only seven other actors had been Oscar-nominated for playing a US president.",
      "Frank Langella was recognised for his portrayal of Richard Nixon, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Raymond Massey were both nominated for playing Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Sam Rockwell was nominated for playing George W Bush, Alexander Knox for Woodrow Wilson, and James Whitmore for Harry Truman.",
      "Perhaps most notably, Sir Anthony Hopkins has been nominated twice for portraying two different presidents in separate films - once as Nixon and another as John Quincy Adams.",
      "Stan is slightly different in that he portrays Trump in his younger years as a real estate tycoon, rather than during his tenure as president, but we're still chalking that up as worthy of induction into this exclusive club.",
      "11. Robbie Williams' biopic Better Man is nominated for best visual effects, but he also has a connection to two other films in the race.",
      "The British singer's track Swing Supreme features in a pivotal scene of Emilia P\u00e9rez, while his former Take That bandmates feature at the beginning of Anora as a remix of Greatest Day plays in a nightclub.",
      "Its prominence in the film led to the remaining members of Take That performing the song at this year's Bafta Film Awards.",
      "12. Ralph Fiennes could be a good omen for Conclave.",
      "The last two times the British star was nominated for acting, for Schindler's List and The English Patient, his film won best picture.",
      "If Conclave wins, Fiennes would set a record for having appeared in the most best picture winners, becoming the only actor with roles in four (the other being The Hurt Locker).",
      "However, Edward Berger's absence in the best director category significantly weakens Conclave's chances. Only six films have ever won best picture without a corresponding director nomination.",
      "On the plus side, three of those have been in the last 12 years (Argo, Coda and Green Book), suggesting this is less of an obstacle than it used to be.",
      "Why wasn't Berger nominated? One possible factor is that, unlike the five directors who were, he didn't write or co-write his film's screenplay. Conclave was adapted from Robert Harris's novel by British screenwriter Peter Straughan.",
      "13. Diane Warren really wants to win.",
      "The songwriter scored her 16th best original song nomination this year, for writing The Journey, from The Six Triple Eight.",
      "But Warren has never won. With Emilia P\u00e9rez's campaign damaged and potentially splitting votes with two songs in the category, could this finally be her year?",
      "She certainly hopes so. Earlier this month, when a film account on X asked followers: \"Which Oscar winner would make you happiest?\" Warren brilliantly replied: \"Me!\"",
      "14. Wicked has a tall hill to climb to win best picture, having missed both a directing and screenplay nomination.",
      "It did score several technical nods as well as acting nominations for Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, but neither are frontrunners in their category.",
      "The last film to win best picture without a corresponding win in a director, screenplay or acting category was Rebecca in 1942.",
      "15. Two nominees are following in their mothers' footsteps.",
      "I'm Still Here star Fernanda Torres is nominated for best actress - after her mother Fernanda Montenegro became the first Brazilian nominee in the same category in 1999 for Central Station.",
      "Meanwhile, Conclave star Isabella Rossellini's mother, Ingrid Bergman, was nominated for best actress six times in her career, winning twice, and won best supporting actress.",
      "16. Anora's director could become the first person to win four Oscars for the same film.",
      "As Sean Baker was involved in so many aspects of the film's production, he could personally win best picture, editing, director and screenplay.",
      "Nobody has ever done this before.",
      "Walt Disney did win four Oscars in the same night in 1953, but for four different films.",
      "And Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho came incredibly close in 2020, but as the best international film prize technically goes to the country that submitted it rather than the director, he only took home three for his own trophy cabinet.",
      "If Anora does win the top prize, it will be the second consecutive year the director of best picture co-wins with his wife. Baker and wife Samantha Quan would follow Oppenheimer's Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas.",
      "Anora would also be the first 18-rated film to win best picture since The Departed in 2007.",
      "17. It's official: The cat in Flow is named Flow.",
      "The delightful movie about a cat who survives a flood is a dark horse in the animated film category, having beaten box office juggernauts Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot to the prize at the Golden Globes.",
      "\"While we worked on Flow the cat didn't have a name,\" the film's director Gints Zilbalodis said earlier this month. \"We just called it the cat.",
      "\"I've heard from multiple people that they think that its name is Flow. People have even named their cats Flow now! So I think we can call the cat Flow.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Demi Moore were among the Oscar nominees who gathered in Los Angeles on Tuesday for the annual \"class photo\".",
      "Ahead of the Academy Awards on Sunday (2 March), the nominees from all categories were invited to mingle over dinner and cocktails, as an eventful awards race reaches its conclusion.",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",
      "However, it's been confirmed she will attend the Oscars ceremony itself on Sunday - although it remains to be seen if she will walk the red carpet and sit with her co-stars.",
      "12. Clarence Maclin knows what time it is",
      "Sing Sing star Clarence Maclin was widely considered the most notable absence in the best supporting actor category this year.",
      "But he is still nominated at the Oscars thanks to his story credit on the film, which means he is recognised in the best adapted screenplay category.",
      "Maclin was one of the real-life inmates at the Sing Sing jail, after being sentenced to 17 years in jail for robbery, aged 29, and was a member of the prison's Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) programme.",
      "In the class photo, Maclin, who plays a version of himself in Sing Sing, is either checking his watch or possibly about to sneeze.",

      "Conclave, which focuses on a group of gossipy and scheming cardinals in Rome, failed to win any other awards, but its victory in the top category leaves it in a strong position ahead of the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "The best picture race has been wide open this year, with The Brutalist and Emilia P\u00e9rez winning at the Golden Globes, Conclave at the Baftas and now SAG Awards, and Anora at a string of industry guilds including those voted by producers, writers and directors.",
      "Moore's win for body horror The Substance is the latest twist in a tight best actress race - the category is seen as a dead heat between her and relative newcomer Mikey Madison, who won the Bafta.",
      "\"This is extraordinary, and so deeply meaningful,\" Moore said as she collected her SAG trophy.",
      "She recalled getting her first SAG card aged 15 \"changed my life because it gave me meaning, it gave me purpose, and it gave me direction\".",
      "\"I was a kid on my own who had no blueprint for life, and I certainly knew nothing about acting. But I watched, and I listened and I learned from all of you.",

      "Elsewhere, Chalamet was a surprise winner in best actor thanks to his portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, beating Adrien Brody who has been winning the category throughout awards season.",
      "\"I know the classiest thing would be to downplay the effort that went into this role and how much this means to me,\" Chalamet said in his speech.",
      "\"But the truth is, this was five-and-a-half years of my life, I poured everything I have into playing this incomparable artist, Mr Bob Dylan, an American hero, and it was the honour of a lifetime playing him.\"",

      "\"And for a woman like me, who grew up in the 40s and 50s when women weren't supposed to have opinions and get angry, acting gave me a chance to play angry women with opinions, which as you know is a stretch for me,\" she joked.",
      "\"I'm a big believer in unions, they have our backs, they bring us into community, and they give us power. This is really important right now when workers' power is being attacked and community is being weakened.\"",
      "In an impassioned speech which indirectly referenced political turmoil, Fonda concluded: \"We mustn't kid ourselves about what is happening.",

      "More than one million players have logged on to the PC version of Monster Hunter Wilds within hours of its launch, according to figures from online store Steam.",
      "There have been complaints from the first wave of players on Steam about the game's performance on computers, but its critical response has been positive.",
      "BBC Newsbeat spoke to director Yuya Tokuda and producer Ryozo Tsujimoto prior to the release of Wilds about turning the game into a global hit.",
      "Monster Hunter first launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004.",
      "As the title suggests, players spend the game navigating an area known as The Forbidden Lands capturing and battling a cast of increasingly fearsome beasts.",
      "Long-time fans of the series are drawn in by its challenging, complex systems and option to play co-operatively, teaming up with friends to take down massive foes.",
      "Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included.",
      "Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series.",
      "\"Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,\" he said.",
      "Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of \"brain drain\" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.",
      "Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.",
      "Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.",
      "\"It's the groundwork that you create with your previous titles that you hope can inform the success of later ones,\" he says.",
      "\"We have the ability to take data from past titles like Monster Hunter World and analyse that data in order to understand what players were enjoying and what we could improve.\"",
      "Other Japanese studios are known for taking this iterative approach and building on what has come before.",
      "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the makers of the popular Yakuza series and its Like a Dragon spin-offs, have put out a new game more or less every year since 2020.",
      "The company's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama has spoken openly about how the team is happy to revisit previous locations and reuse elements from earlier games rather doing a \"fresh reboot\" each time.",
      "This can help to lower development costs and reduce the time it takes to make new titles.",
      "'We're working in our own lanes'",
      "The Japanese games industry was a dominant force from the 1980s until the early 2000s, but a power shift saw Western developers begin to lead the way.",
      "More recently, the country has been behind some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles released.",
      "At last year's Game Awards - described by some as the industry's answer to The Oscars - Japanese-made games occupied four of the six Game of the Year nominations.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto says he can't pinpoint a specific reason for this, but says the Monster Hunter team has learned there are certain things needed to make a \"triple-A success in today's market\".",
      "That includes translating games into various languages so they can be released simultaneously in different countries, and being mindful of growing your audience.",
      "\"We're always careful to design the experience so new players can get into the game,\" he adds.",

      "Mr Tsujimoto says generational leaps \"push the industry forward\", bringing \"new opportunities and new complexities\".",
      "\"I don't think it's necessarily the most difficult it's ever been but there are always new challenges whenever technology leaps forward.\"",
      "The games industry is also more competitive than ever - more video games are being released, and players are tending to stick with the same ones for longer periods.",
      "It leaves publishers of new releases fighting over a much smaller share of players' free time and 2025 has already been packed with big new releases.",
      "Mr Tsujimoto insists they haven't paid too much attention to that while working on Monster Hunter Wilds.",
      "\"It looks like a big year for everyone but we're really all just working in our own lanes,\" he says.",
      "\"We happened to have this launch window that's on the verge of some other big releases but we don't have access to that information before the general public.\"",
      "For an established series that suddenly explodes in popularity, Mr Tokuda says a big challenge is pleasing old and new fans.",

      "The Department of Health and Social care says it is working closely with the NHS, manufacturers and others in the supply chain to try to resolve the issues.",

      "Diana Gibb, who is 74, and her husband Mick, 78, live in Tonbridge, Kent.",
      "Mick had a major operation to treat pancreatic cancer in 2023. Diana wrote to BBC News explaining that it is impossible for Mick to digest food without creon. She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",
      "\"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week.",
      "\"Pharmacies cannot get hold of lower dosage either and there is no alternative medication. I was worried that my husband would starve to death without them.\"",
      "Diana says for now they can get supplies of the drug but there is no guarantee week-to-week, and that is still a big worry.",
      "Bryony Thomas, who is from Stroud in Gloucestershire, needs creon after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly.  She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe.",
      "At one stage, she says she obtained the drug from another patient, who had a surplus, against regulations via Instagram. She describes her situation as \"constantly stressful\".",
      "Leading pancreatic clinicians and charities including Pancreatic Cancer UK have written to the prime minister saying the absence of Pert can have a \"devastating impact on people's lives\", with doctors and pharmacists \"inundated with requests for help from desparate patients\".",
      "The letter says that without the drug, people experience \"horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life\".",
      "There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".  They say that with creon running short, switching by patients has depleted stocks of the alternatives. They are calling for a national process for importing Pert.",

      "The charity has told patients that a \"shortage of raw ingredients is straining the manufacturing process and disrupting global supply chains\".",
      "Production of creon is said to rely heavily on pancreatic enzymes sourced from pigs.  The Royal Pharmaceutical Society meanwhile is calling on the government to adopt a national strategy to manage medicine shortages.",
      "There have been wider problems with drug shortages. The National Pharmacy Association, representing community chemists in the UK, sought views on the issue.",
      "Of the 500 which responded, all said they were unable to dispense a prescription at least once a day because of supply problems, and a large majority said patients came in at least once a day to get medicines they had failed to get elsewhere.",
      "A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We know how frustrating and distressing medicine supply issues can be for patients, and the pharmacists and clinicians caring for them.",

      "Anyone over the age of 18 and with a prognosis of 12 months or fewer to live would be eligible, under the legislation being debated in the Manx parliament.",
      "The bill will not be passed yet, since the Isle of Man's lower house has rejected an amendment that would have meant people would only need residency on the island for one year to take advantage of the legislation.",
      "The House of Keys continued to insist on five-year residency and have sent the legislation back to the upper house.",

      "The measures have been a matter of strong debate in Tynwald, the island's parliament.",
      "It is likely the bill will receive Royal Assent and become law, with the scheme possibly up and running by 2027.",
      "Jersey - a self-governing territory like the Isle of Man which can make its own laws - is also moving ahead with legislation to establish an assisted dying service.",

      "\"It lays the basis for further work to implement a service on the Island for those facing a terminal illness who would like more autonomy and dignity at the time of their death.\"",

      "Both bills spell out the need for patients to have the mental capacity to make the choice and be deemed to have expressed a clear, settled and informed wish, free from coercion or pressure.",
      "The Isle of Man bill says people would be expected to have fewer than 12 months to live, but the Leadbeater bill has adopted a more conservative six months.",
      "The Manx suggestion of needing five years of residency on the island to be eligible is to try to stop people going there to take advantage of the scheme, as people do by travelling to Switzerland's Dignitas clinic.",
      "Assisted Dying Bill passed by Legislative Council",
      "Manx doctors reject assisted dying bill in survey",
      "On the Isle of Man, two independent doctors will need to agree the request for assisted dying, but Leadbeater has recently suggested that cases in England and Wales could be approved by a panel of experts rather than a single judge, as was originally proposed.",
      "That change has proved controversial, but is one of about 300 amendments being considered by a cross-party committee of MPs.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislation being proposed in Jersey has very similar restrictions to the Westminster plans. However, it has a proposal that would extend the right to die for terminally ill adults with six months or fewer left to live to 12 months for people with neurodegenerative conditions",
      "As with the Westminster legislation, the Isle of Man has experienced some passionate campaigning both for and against the proposed new law.",
      "A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving if the legislation was introduced.",

      "Listen to this article",
      "At the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.",
      "Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.",
      "\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"",
      "He is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.",
      "\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.",
      "In and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.",
      "And the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.",
      "An anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.",
      "The drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.",
      "And thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.",
      "Now, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.",
      "'Ketamine addiction left me crying in pain'Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choiceKetamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",

      "Hooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choice",
      "Ketamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'",
      "But some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.",
      "'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'",
      "One Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.",
      "The coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.",
      "Those on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"",
      "Across Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"",
      "Once ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.",
      "Those who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.",
      "'Everybody else is doing it'",
      "One mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.",
      "Lexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.",
      "\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"",
      "One reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.",
      "In Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.",
      "To feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"",
      "'You're doing stupid amounts'",
      "What makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.",
      "At lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"",
      "And this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.",
      "\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.",
      "Higher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.",
      "Then there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.",
      "'Extremely dangerous'",
      "Some of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.",
      "The government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"",
      "Families in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.",
      "In response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".",
      "'The urge is always there'",
      "There is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.",
      "\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.",
      "And some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".",
      "In the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.",
      "Lexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.",
      "Getting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".",

    "story": [
      "International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget.",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\".",
      "She told the PM she had delayed her resignation until after his meeting with President Trump, saying it was \"imperative that you had a united cabinet behind you as you set off for Washington\".",
      "The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with \"sadness\" that she was resigning.",
      "She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not \"ideologically opposed\" to international development, the cuts were \"being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID\".",
      "Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\".",
      "He said cutting aid was a \"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\" adding: \"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\"",

      "In her resignation letter, Dodds said she welcomed an increase to defence spending at a time when the post-war global order had \"come crashing down\".",
      "She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance].",
      "However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \"absorb the entire burden\".",
      "She said the cuts would \"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\".",
      "\"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\"",
      "The spending cuts mean \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.",
      "The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support.",
      "He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move.",
      "Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister.",
      "But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\".",
      "Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds.",
      "Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers.",

      "However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Dodds had done \"the right thing\" and urged the government to find alternative ways to pay for increases to defence spending.",
      "He suggested raising money through increases to the digital services tax or setting up a European rearmament bank, which would lend money to governments to buy military equipment or the private sector to expand their manufacturing capacity.",
      "Sir Ed argued that if the UK cut back on overseas aid, China and Russia would \"fill the vacuum\".",

      "So apparently putting Britain first \u2013 more spent on defence here, less spending overseas \u2013 will be seen by some as a way of inoculating themselves against the growing threat of Reform.",

      "Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with England's GPs, the government has said.",
      "The deal gives an extra \u00a3889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients.",
      "The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.",
      "However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament.",
      "GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.",
      "Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.",
      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",
      "More money to cover rising costs",
      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",
      "The total figure includes almost \u00a3800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients.",
      "Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.",
      "GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\".",
      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",
      "\"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.",

      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",

      "Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development.",
      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",
      "\"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said.",

      "The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK.",
      "The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000.",
      "This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000).",
      "Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route.",
      "The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas.",

      "Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford,  referred to a \"boom and bust\" in some visa categories over recent years.",
      "\"The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high,\" he said.",
      "\"Despite the declines, overall visa grants to non-EU citizens remain well above pre-Brexit levels.\""

    "summary": "A government-commissioned review will call for content showing women being choked during sex to be illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Degrading, violent and misogynistic pornography should be banned, a review of the industry has recommended.",
      "The review, commissioned by the previous government and headed by the Conservative peer Baroness Gabby Bertin, urges ministers to give regulator Ofcom sweeping powers to police porn sites deemed to contain \"harmful\" material.",
      "It proposes outlawing \"degrading, violent and misogynistic content\", including making it illegal to possess or publish pornography showing women being choked during sex.",
      "Non-fatal strangulation is already an offence if someone does not consent but its depiction online is not illegal and the review finds it is \"rife on mainstream platforms\".",
      "All porn sites must 'robustly' verify UK user ages by July",
      "The 'incredible' number of UK adults watching porn",
      "The review proposes that porn videos considered too harmful for any certificate in the offline world should be banned online.",
      "Baroness Bertin argues that online pornography contributes to some of the \"gravest issues in our society, from domestic violence to toxic masculinity to the mental health crisis among young people\".",
      "She told the BBC: \"I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch porn. I'm not saying porn shouldn't exist. I'm not a prude.\"",
      "However, her 32 recommendations on what government should do about the \"high-harm sector\" of legal online pornography are likely to initiate a debate about how far the state should police people's sex lives.",
      "Baroness Bertin said online porn was not \"properly scrutinised and regulated\" in the same way as offline content.",
      "\"It strikes me as incredible that to buy a DVD, which sounds so sort of retro, the BBFC [British Board of Film Classification] has to put a stamp on it, has to check that certain standards have been met. That there's no sense you are encouraging child sexual abuse. No harmful, degrading, humiliating practices which is not through consensual roleplay,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"You just have to go on the homepages of some of these mainstream sites and you will see of all that degrading content \u2013 particularly violent towards women \u2013 and it's all there for everyone to see.\"",
      "Her report suggests pornography websites depicting the non-fatal choking of women during sex has normalised such behaviour in the real world, with violent and degrading material rife on mainstream platforms amid a \"total absence of government scrutiny\".",
      "The review cites research suggesting that over a quarter of the nation regularly accesses online porn with a third of all men watching material at least once a week. It concludes that increasingly disturbing content is \"rewiring\" the way young people think about gender, sex and their role in society.",
      "The Department for Science Innovation and Technology said it would look at the links the review highlighted.",
      "\"We have already announced we will ban the creation of intimate deepfakes without consent and from next month under the Online Safety Act platforms will have to proactively tackle illegal content including extreme pornography and sexual abuse material,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"But further action is needed to address the review's shocking finding that graphic strangulation is increasingly appearing in pornography, despite being illegal, and is becoming normalised in real life.",
      "\"We will urgently ensure that platforms, law enforcement and prosecutors take all necessary steps to tackle this disturbing harm.\"",
      "Downing Street also described the findings of a report into the porn industry as \"shocking\", and suggested it would \"act swiftly\" to address gaps in the law - but stopped short of saying it would be banned.",
      "The review's recommendations were welcomed by the End Violence Against Women Coalition, which called for action from the government to address the harms arising from the current state of the porn industry.",
      "\"We know these companies are profiting enormously from sexual violence, and until they are forced to clean up their act, they won't,\" the group's director Andrea Simon said.",
      "Madelaine Thomas, an adult content creator, also welcomed the review but added: \"If we look to police people's sexual interests that's problematic.",
      "\"I don't think prohibition has ever eliminated demand in any way but I do think there are ways that we can work together to come up with frameworks that prioritise both consent and compassion and allow people to create and view what they would like to view on the internet,\" she told BBC Two's Politics Live.",
      "'Confusing world'",
      "Baroness Bertin argues that her proposals for sweeping new controls in currently legal pornography online would prevent real-world violence against women and girls.",
      "The review relates how a 14-year-old boy asked a teacher how to choke girls during sex and suggests online porn has created \"such a confusing world for our sons\".",
      "\"They are, quite rightly, encouraged and taught to reject sexist attitudes, while a subterranean online world of pornography is simultaneously showing them that anything goes,\" Baroness Bertin writes.",
      "Ministers are urged to fund programmes for boys and young men which encourage positive masculinity and counter misogynistic culture.",
      "The report quotes BBC research suggesting up to 38% of British women had experienced being strangled during intercourse, but notes that nearly half of those women wanted to be choked. \"This is important in demonstrating freedom of sexual expression and its nuance,\" the review says.",
      "Nevertheless, the report concludes that society has decided that \"enough is enough\" of harmful online pornography and its impact on young people.",
      "Measures to increase regulation of pornography, including to prevent children accessing explicit content, are already part of the Online Safety Act, which became law in October 2023.",

      "A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"minded to approve\" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.",
      "The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.",
      "The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.",
      "If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The \u00a32.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.",
      "\"I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,\" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.",
      "Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has \"outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year\" and that the airport would \"engage fully\" in the process.",
      "The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.",
      "Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.",
      "On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was \"not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior\".",
      "The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.",

      "Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is \"full\".",

      "It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.",
      "But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has challenged Sir Keir Starmer over the hike in defence spending, after the PM said the rise amounted to \u00a313.4bn.",
      "The PM announced the UK will reallocate aid funds to boost military spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, following President Trump's demand that all European allies increase their defence contributions.",
      "The decision comes as Sir Keir is set to fly to the US for talks with Trump in the White House, to discuss the war in Ukraine, later.",
      "Badenoch questioned Sir Keir over the exact amount, which Defence Secretary John Healey said could be calculated as \u00a36bn when inflation was taken into account, and whether the Chagos deal would be funded from it.",

      "Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump?",
      "Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence?",
      "At Prime Minister's Questions, Badenoch asked whether any of the new funding would be going towards the multi-billion pound Chagos deal twice.",
      "The UK plans to hand over the territory to Mauritius, but under the terms of the deal, the UK will continue to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase, for a period of 99 years.",
      "The PM responded saying the increase in defence spending that was announced on Tuesday was for \"our capability on defence and security in Europe\", adding: \"The Chagos deal is extremely important for our security and for US security.\"",
      "Badenoch focused her questions to the prime minister on which figure for the defence rise - his initial \u00a313.4bn or \u00a36bn, which Healey said was the increase \"in real terms\"  - was correct.",
      "Sir Keir responded: \"If you take the numbers for this financial year and then the numbers for the financial year 2027-28, that's a \u00a313.4bn increase.",
      "\"That's the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the Cold War which will put us in a position to ensure the security and defence of our country and of Europe.\"",
      "Badenoch pressed him again, saying: \"The IFS said today that the government is playing silly games with numbers. How does he find this difference in numbers?\"",
      "Repeating himself, the PM then said they had already been \"going through the same question over and over again\" at previous PMQs and said \"if you ask again I'll give the same answer again\", to loud cheers from his backbenchers.",
      "Objecting, Badenoch pointed out that \"being patronising is not the same as answering the question\".",
      "When Badenoch suggested Sir Keir had listened to her advice on using international aid money for defence, he said: \"I'm going to have to let the leader of the opposition down gently... She didn't feature in my thinking at all.",
      "\"I was so busy over the weekend I didn't even see her proposal.",
      "\"She has appointed herself I think saviour of the western civilisation in a desperate search for relevance.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged the prime minister to back the idea of a European rearmament bank \"so that we can finance a big increase in manufacturing capacity without the need to cut Britain's vital soft power\".",
      "The prime minister replied that there was \"an ongoing discussion\" with allies about future funding and he would share details with MPs \"as it evolves\".",
      "Earlier, a former defence chief of staff said he believed the decision to hike UK defence spending has been \"accelerated\" by President Donald Trump's actions on Ukraine.",
      "General Sir David Richards said the decision to raise defence spending over the next two years was a sound strategic move, but one that \"almost certainly would not\" be happening if not for Trump.",
      "\"It was going to happen, it's now been accelerated by Donald Trump's actions, and all of us, I think, would say not before time,\" he told  BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "Lord Richards stressed the British Army was currently \"very hollowed out indeed\" and suggested the \"army isn't big enough\" currently for British troops to be part of a rotation of European peacekeeping forces.",
      "Questions have been raised about the Labour government's U-turn on its manifesto pledge to raise international development funding to 0.7% of gross national income, with unease among some Labour MPs about the move.",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Labour backbencher Diane Abbott suggested the decision could increase the risk of conflict abroad, telling the PM that \"there is also a view that taking money from aid and development to spend on armaments and tanks makes people less safe, not more safe, because the desperation and poverty that so often leads to warfare is what aid and development money is supposed to counter.\"",
      "The PM defended the decision in the chamber, and earlier Healey had said \"hard power is now more important than soft power\".",
      "Asked whether the increase announced on Tuesday is linked to Sir Keir's visit to the White House, Healey told the Today programme: \"President Trump, over the last two weeks, has been very direct in his challenge.",
      "\"He's reinforced the imperative and the importance of Britain making this commitment and helping other European countries to step up in a similar way.\"",
      "The US has been warning European leaders it wants to see a significant increase in their defence contributions to Nato for at least a decade.",
      "Trump's rapprochement with Russia's Vladimir Putin, and the US siding with Russia on a UN resolution on Ukraine, has sent shockwaves through European allies.",
      "Asked whether he believed the UK increasing its defence contribution would bring Trump on side, Healey said that the PM could now tell Trump: \"You are challenging Europe and the UK to step up on European security, on Ukraine, on defence spending, on reinforcing our industrial base.",
      "\"We are, and we will step up further.\"",

    "summary": "The environment secretary is met with blaring tractor horns as he tries to win over farmers.",
    "story": [
      "Farmers protesting at government changes to agricultural inheritance tax rules have briefly disrupted a minister's speech at a national conference.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed was met with horns from tractors parked outside and protesters who silently unfurled banners in front of him as he outlined farming reforms, which included plans to focus on food production and make the industry more resilient to disruption.",
      "Reed told the hundreds gathered at the National Farmers' Union (NFU) conference that he could not give them \"the answer many of you want on inheritance tax\" but he understood the strength of feeling in the room.",
      "NFU president Tom Bradshaw told the annual conference on Tuesday the inheritance tax changes were \"morally wrong and economically flawed\".",
      "Under the government's planned changes, from April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",
      "The government has previously said that the changes will only impact the wealthiest 500 farms each year, a number disputed by farmers unions which estimate up to 70,000 farms could be affected overall.",
      "Mr Bradshaw, whose speech was also briefly interrupted by two protesters who appeared to be urging people to be vegan, said the government had broken promises made before the election and had increased the mental health pressures on farmers, calling for it to correct the tax policy \"urgently'.",
      "\"We will fight this family farm tax until ministers do the right thing,\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, this government needs a reset moment with farming, where they face up to the reality of how much the industry is struggling.\"",
      "Many farmers argue that while they are asset rich, for example in terms of their land or livestock, they are cash poor and the proposed changes would mean they would have to sell up in order to pay the tax.",
      "What is inheritance tax, who pays it and what's changing for farmers?",
      "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
      "In his speech, Reed had also outlined plans for a 25-year farming roadmap and food strategy, which would put food production at its core and make farm businesses more resilient to challenges such as severe flooding, drought and animal disease.",
      "He said it would ensure farming is a \"sector which recognises restoring nature is not in competition with sustainable food production, but is essential to it\".",
      "As farmers outside the conference centre sounded their tractor horns, he announced measures including extending the seasonal worker visa scheme for five years, support for precision breeding and new technology.",
      "He also announced new requirements for government catering contracts to favour \"high quality, high welfare products that British producers are well placed to meet\".",
      "Earlier in the day, a multi-generational farming family - Martin Towler, his daughter and son-in-law, Hazel and Tom Church, and their five-year-old son Bertie - went to the Treasury to handover a collection of pre-loved farming toys donated by farmers who might be hit by the government's proposed changes to agricultural inheritance tax.",
      "The family have been farming Scald End Farm, a mixed beef and sheep farm in north Bedfordshire, since the 1940s but they all now also have to work off farm to supplement their income.",
      "They say the impact of the proposed inheritance tax changes will leave them facing a \u00a3400,000 bill and the prospect of selling off so much of the 210-acre farm that it would become unviable as a business.",
      "Mr Church said he hoped the government would listen to farmers' concerns and try to find a compromise on its inheritance tax policy.",
      "He told the BBC the changes, as currently proposed, would have a \"detrimental\" impact on the family's ability to run a profitable business.",
      "\"We are struggling at the moment as it is. There's no two ways about that,\" he said.",
      "\"Farming is incredibly low return on investment when you look at the asset values of the land and the income generated.",
      "\"If we are saddled with further debt through death - is it viable? Selling land is going to make it even less viable.\"",

      "During Tuesday's conference in Westminster - the first time it has been held outside Birmingham for years - Reed, took questions from the audience.",
      "There was clear anger among those questioning him on the tax changes and he was told many older farmers \"were wishing their lives away\" and now felt they would benefit their families by dying before the 2026 tax change.",

      "The Crime and Policing Bill is at the heart of what the government calls its \"Safer Streets mission\" and ministers want it to become law by the end of the year.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC the bill would address an \"epidemic of street theft\", including a rise in phone and bag snatching and shoplifting, and introduce new \"Respect Orders\" with restrictions similar to Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (Asbos).",

      "The bill, unveiled in Parliament on Tuesday, pulls together many measures set out in Labour's general election manifesto.",
      "But they come amid questions over whether police have the funding to make the government's plan work.",
      "Under the bill, police would gain the power to enter and search a property without a court warrant for a stolen mobile phone or other items that have been electronically tracked, such as laptops or Bluetooth-tagged bikes.",
      "The power would mean that victims of mobile phone thefts who track their device while it is in the hands of a criminal could call on police to recover it quickly.",
      "Cooper told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she understood the \"incredible frustration\" of phone theft victims who say \"I can track it, I can see where it is - it's in this particular house, it's in this particular location\".",
      "\"And yet the police can't act fast enough to be able to track it down,\" she added.",
      "Cooper said \"we have to have the stronger powers and action [and] the police say they welcome this\".",
      "Asked about the reliability of locator apps, where people can use another device to help track down the location of their missing or stolen phone, being used in police searches, Cooper told BBC Breakfast: \"Police will have to make decisions [and] it will need to be signed off by a police inspector, and [they will] need to make decisions about where the evidence is good enough for them to be able to act.\"",
      "She added that the bill would include scrapping a \"ludicrous\" \u00a3200 threshold for shoplifting, which meant lower value thefts were not currently prioritised by police.",
      "Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins told Sky News she was \"deeply concerned\" that no longer treating shoplifting below \u00a3200 as a summary-only offence would have significant long-term effects on crown courts, saying \"victims of rape will find it even harder and longer to get their day in court\".",
      "But Cooper said addressing lower value thefts which were not likely to lead to prison would stop criminal behaviour escalating to the stage where such sentences would apply.",
      "The bill also includes the government's proposed \"Respect Orders\" - court-imposed restrictions that will be similar to the Asbo developed in the Tony Blair era, then scrapped by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition a decade ago.",
      "While Asbos were popular with voters, critics say the restrictions often became unworkable or poorly enforced.",
      "The proposed Respect Orders allow courts to impose restrictions on an individual's behaviour, just like an Asbo.",
      "But they would also be able to compel them to attend programmes such as addiction treatment or anger management courses to change their ways.",
      "Other measures previously announced in the bill include:",
      "An offence of assaulting a shop worker - also a Conservative commitment before the 2024 General Election.A new police power to seize without warning off-road bikes or e-scooters.A new offence of spiking drinks, separate to current assault laws.Giving judges the power to issue a Stalking Prevention Order against a suspect, even if they are not convicted of a crime.",

      "Restaurant and retail bosses have written to Cooper to warn the bill \"stops short\" of protecting delivery riders under the plans. They want the new offence of threatening or assaulting a shop worker in their place of work to include couriers on journeys to and from customers.",
      "Cooper refused to be drawn on whether introducing new criminal offences would add unwelcome extra pressure on police, prisons, and the court system.",
      "Several police forces across England and Wales have previously warned they will have to make cuts to existing officers this year despite receiving extra funding, and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in December that prisons were at risk of running out of space.",
      "Cooper told the Today programme that a boost in police spending and increasing \"early prevention action\" would help prevent crimes escalating and prison sentences needing to be imposed, while community measures like tagging and curfews would also be strengthened.",
      "The Home Office says the bill's aims will be delivered by recruiting 13,000 additional neighbourhood officers by 2029 - and the department has pledged \u00a3200m specifically towards that.",
      "The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC ) said last year that forces faced a \u00a31.3bn funding gap, and the available cash was not being shared evenly between forces due to outdated rules.",
      "The Home Office has since confirmed it is putting \u00a31.1bn extra into policing up to April 2026.",
      "But the NPCC has warned that if it is to deliver the \"Safer Streets\" plan, forces would need a pay settlement that would help them to attract and retain the best possible officers.",

      "In a statement Ms Pritchard said it had been a \"hugely difficult decision for me to stand down\".",
      "\"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.\"",
      "She took up the post in 2021 and played a central role in the official response to the Covid pandemic.",
      "Before that, she was NHS England's chief operating officer, head of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust in London and an adviser in Tony Blair's government.",
      "Her departure comes less than a month after two influential House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS through a period of what Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said will be the biggest overhaul of the service.",
      "As to the timing of her resignation, some words in her letter are significant.",
      "She noted that there is due to be radical reform of the size and functions of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to \"drive the government's reform priorities\" and that the \"step change required\" would be best served by new leadership.",
      "Sources have indicated that the government wants to bind NHS England closer to the Department of Health to push ahead with changes, including shifting the focus from hospitals to community care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting may well have felt the need to find a new leader, and Amanda Pritchard possibly felt that after several years at NHS England she did not want to be on a tighter rein.",
      "Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government.",
      "\"Wes Streeting is entitled to shape things as he wishes\", said one, \"but the role of NHS England chief executive will change\".",
      "A government source indicated NHS England would in due course be a smaller organisation as some powers were devolved to regional health boards.",

      "'Turbulent waters'",
      "NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS.",
      "Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment.",
      "He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\"",
      "Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS.",
      "\"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said.",
      "Ms Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks.",
      "The public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism.",
      "MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning.",
      "Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\"",
      "NHS England has announced that Sir James Mackey, currently chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals, will be taking over as interim head of NHS England and will work closely with Ms Pritchard for the next month before taking up post formally in April.",

      "Sir James, a highly experienced NHS trust boss, will be known as transition chief executive with no time limit set on how long he will serve. It's understood that no appointment process has been set up to look for a replacement for Ms Pritchard."

      "He warned the UK's food security was being put \"at risk\" by farmers being forced out of business and an increasing reliance on imported food, adding the GCA had improved the relationship between farmers and retailers but needed to evolve.",

    "summary": "A deal to avoid further trade barriers appears very much on the cards, but challenges remain.",
    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "It's unclear what, if any, role Donald Trump's administration may have played in their release, but one of Trump's top envoys is said to have raised the case with Romania's Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu at a security conference in Munich earlier this month.",
      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",
      "But the brothers have been the subject of recent high-level discussions between the US and Romania.",
      "Romanian officials say US counterparts brought up the brothers' case with the Romanian government earlier this month, a story first reported by the Financial Times.",
      "And Trump special envoy Richard Grenell raised the issue again at a security conference in Munich.",

      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",
      "The statement alleged that the Tates and others are victims of \"weaponised legal systems\" and \"politically motivated prosecutions\".",
      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",

      "Four British women who have filed a civil lawsuit against Andrew Tate meanwhile issued a statement calling on UK authorities to \"take action\", saying they were \"in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news\".",
      "And support for the Tates is far from universal among Trump supporters and American conservatives, many of whom moved to immediately distance themselves from the brothers.",
      "Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Tates landed on Thursday, said of their activities: \"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct.\"",
      "The state's attorney general later said he would open a preliminary inquiry into the Tates and said Florida has \"zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women\".",
      "In the conservative Washington Examiner, podcaster Brady Leonard wrote: \"Tate's obnoxious, misogynistic brand is toxic to everyone besides electorally insignificant corners of social media.\"",
      "Matt Lewis, a US conservative political commentator who has been critical of Trump in the past, said advocating on behalf of Tate \"fits in with the ethos of the Maga world right now, which is: 'let's be tough guys'\".",

I think that's had some real psychic effects,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A big moment and a big decision, ahead of a big meeting.",
      "The government's announcement that it will crank up defence spending and shrivel the international aid budget amounts to a big shift in strategy, posture and political positioning.",
      "Take a look at the Labour Party's election manifesto, written less than a year ago, if you would like proof of that.",
      "On page 125, it says: \"Labour is committed to restoring development spending at the level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as soon as fiscal circumstances allow.\"",
      "The party is now committing to doing the precise opposite \u2013 cutting development spending by the same amount by which it had promised to raise it.",
      "There is nothing like an outspoken American president and an imminent visit to the White House to sharpen the mind \u2013 and hey presto, along came this announcement just as the prime minister packs his shirts for his trip across the Atlantic.",
      "Along came the thumbs-up from the Trump administration not long later.",
      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",
      "Little wonder, then, that we have seen a blitz of the jitters in European capitals as presidents and prime ministers try to work out what it may or may not mean.",
      "The task facing Starmer - the second strand of the European tag team of leaders to visit Washington, after President Emmanuel Macron on Monday - is to attempt to mould President Donald Trump's position.",
      "Over the coming weeks and months, can a deal be done where the war stops, Ukraine does not feel defeated, Europe does not feel imperilled and transatlantic relations are as near to conventional as possible?",
      "It is not going to be easy.",
      "The prime minister's trip to the White House is but one building block in developing answers to these questions.",
      "And then, over the following weekend, Starmer will host a gathering of European leaders to reflect on where the conversations so far have taken us.",

    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",
      "Prison gangs: \u2018I've chopped people,  attacked staff, hidden drugs\u2019",

      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",
      "But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.",
      "Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.",
      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",
      "The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",

      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",

Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",

      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

      "Nearly 2,000 years after a young man died in the Vesuvius volcanic eruption, scientists have discovered that his brain was preserved when it turned to glass in an extremely hot cloud of ash.",
      "Researchers found the glass in 2020 and speculated that it was a fossilised brain but did not know how it had formed.",
      "The pea-sized chunks of black glass were found inside the skull of the victim, aged about 20, who died when the volcano erupted in 79 AD near modern-day Naples.",
      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",
      "The brain belonged to a man killed in his bed inside a building called the Collegium on the main street of the Roman city Herculaneum.",
      "The fragments of glass found by the scientists range from 1-2 cm to just few millimetres in size.",
      "The massive eruption of Vesuvius engulfed Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii where up to 20,000 people lived. The remains of about 1,500 people have been found.",
      "Scientists now think the hot ash cloud descended from Vesuvius first, probably causing most of the deaths.",
      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",
      "Experts believe the ash cloud turned the man's brain into glass because the pyroclastic flow would not have reached high enough temperatures or cooled quickly enough.",
      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",
      "Only material containing some liquid can turn to glass, meaning that the bones could not have vitrified.",
      "Other soft tissues, like organs, were likely destroyed by the heat before they could cool down enough to turn to glass.",

      "Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.",
      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",
      "Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as \"carbon budgets\", and how it might get there.",
      "Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.",
      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",
      "\"For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,\" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.",
      "\"But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.\"",
      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",
      "\"Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,\" said Ms Pinchbeck.",

    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",

      "As Microsoft once outlined, Skype became integrated with the company's other products such as Xbox and Windows devices.",

      "\"Skype was such an exciting invention at the time - before smartphones and WhatsApp calls,\" she said.",
      "\"It's so easy to assume that we've always been able to freely talk to people across the world but that's such a recent development really.\"",
      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",

      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has unveiled Alexa+, an overhauled version of its virtual assistant with which it hopes users will share \"just about anything\".",
      "Rapid recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have caused huge growth in software capable of natural-sounding conversations, with ChatGPT and DeepSeek among the most-downloaded apps worldwide.",
      "Amazon is attempting to tap into this, with Alexa+ telling a launch event in New York it wanted to be \"your new best friend in the digital world\".",
      "It will be included for free in Prime subscriptions when it launches from March - but to non-members it will cost $19.99 (\u00a316) per month, with the UK price yet to be announced.",
      "However experts have suggested consumers may struggle to get past their limited expectations of Amazon devices.",
      "\"Smart speakers are found in one in four UK homes, yet many users treat them as nothing more than expensive kitchen timers,\" said Ed Freed from marketing agency Rapp UK.",
      "\"Ultimately, the most logical place for a truly personal AI assistant is on your phone, not on your countertop.\"",
      "Amazon's head of devices and services Panos Panay said Alexa+ would remember information, meaning if you tell it you're a gluten intolerant vegan, for example, future recipes it suggested would bear this in mind.",
      "And he promised there would be \"no more Alexa speak\" - meaning users will be able to speak to it more conversationally than previously possible.",
      "These are new features that Dr Richard Whittle of University of Salford's Business School explained were \"long overdue\".",
      "\"Amazon is hoping its upgraded Alexa will challenge Copilot, Google Assistant and Siri, all of whom use new LLM (large language model) technology,\" he said.",
      "\"When users can now chat naturally to their AI assistants, Alexa's once leading voice interaction seems narrow and rigid.\"",
      "His colleague Dr Gordon Fletcher, associate dean of research and innovation, agreed.",
      "\"Technology changes more rapidly now, competing AI models get updated and everyone else scrambles to respond, Grok last week, Claude this week,\" he said.",
      "\"Alexa and the Echo hardware have increasingly seemed like an ageing relic, slow to shift and always behind the curve.\"",
      "A change of strategy",
      "Amazon told the BBC Alexa+ would be available in all countries which currently have Alexa.",
      "In the US, it will be available from March, with other countries getting it later in 2025.",
      "It will be available on devices as far back as the second generation Echo Dot, which launched in 2017.",
      "For its devices with screens, it will be available as far back as the first generation Echo Show 8, which launched in 2019.",
      "It is clear that Amazon expects Alexa+ to do more than its predecessor - and know much more about its users' lives.",
      "Mara Segal, director of Alexa, said people will now be able to share \"just about anything\" with the virtual assistant - the idea being that by sharing emails and photographs, it will be able to search through them for things you request.",
      "Other demonstrations included using it to book a taxi and a dinner reservation at a restaurant.",
      "Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the relaunch was a tacit admission by Amazon that its original vision for smart speakers had failed.",
      "\"By subsidising hundreds of millions of Echo connected speakers, Alexa managed to enter households in the hope of generating incremental e-commerce sales,\" he said.",
      "\"This strategy failed and the company invested $25 billion (\u00a320bn) in its Alexa division, without truly revolutionizing smart homes.\"",
      "He said it was \"about time\" Amazon created a \"truly smart and useful assistant\".",
      "But he warned that to \"truly differentiate\" itself, Alexa would need to distinguish between personal and household data, which \"equals a big privacy and trust hurdle\".",
      "And Dr Stuart Millar, lead AI engineer at Rapid7, said the move \"makes sense\" as Alexa has \"lagged behind\" competitors such as ChatGPT - but warned the real test will be when regular people get their hands on it.",
      "\"We've seen big tech companies launch ambitious AI features before, only to backtrack when unexpected issues arise, or it hasn't behaved as expected,\" he said."

      "Sometimes it is transcribed correctly - but on other occasions it is turned into \"Trump\", before being quickly restored to the correct word.",
      "The BBC has not been able to replicate the mistake, suggesting Apple's fix is already taking effect.",
      "Prof Bell said Apple's explanation of phonetic overlap did not make sense because the two words were not similar enough to confuse an artificial intelligence (AI) system.",
      "Speech-to-text recognition models are trained by inputting clips of real people speaking alongside an accurate transcript of what they say.",
      "They are also taught to understand words in context - for example, they could distinguish the word \"cup\" from \"cut\" if it was within the phrase \"a cup of tea\".",
      "Prof Bell says the situation with Apple is unlikely to be a genuine mistake with its data because its English language model would be trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of speech, which should give it a high level of accuracy.",

    "summary": "The tech giant's decision has prompted questions and concerns about reduced protections for UK iCloud users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has made headlines by pulling its most advanced data security tool for UK customers.",
      "It is removing Advanced Data Protection (ADP) after the Home Office asked for the right to be able to access data which it is applied to - something even Apple itself cannot currently do.",
      "Rather than comply with that request, on Friday the tech giant said it would halt new UK sign-ups to the tool and remove existing user access at a later date.",
      "The move has prompted criticism of the UK government's actions - but also confusion about what protections remain for UK Apple customers.",
      "What is Apple's Advanced Data Protection?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "Items including back-ups, photos, notes and voice memos are given standard encryption by default.",
      "The company can be ordered to hand over this data by law enforcement.",
      "ADP, meanwhile, applies an extra level of protection through what's known as end to end encryption, which means Apple cannot see or access the data - only the user can.",
      "Because Apple does not have a key, losing access to your account can mean losing your data altogether.",
      "It also means law enforcement agencies have no way of accessing such data either.",
      "The tool is independent of the protections for blue messages sent with iMessage, passwords stored in iCloud keychain, Health app data and Facetime, which are end to end encrypted by default.",
      "What does this mean for my iCloud data?",
      "If you are in the UK and have not turned on ADP, you will not see a change to the way your data is protected as a result of Apple disabling it.",
      "Your iCloud data will remain protected by standard encryption and, as before, can still be accessed by Apple.",
      "But it does mean you now cannot apply to protect iCloud storage with end to end encryption, even if you want to.",
      "Meanwhile, people in the UK who had ADP enabled prior to Friday's change will lose access to it a later date.",
      "Apple has not said when, nor how many UK users will be affected.",
      "Some experts have raised alarm over its removal, saying it will leave users less protected and also have wider, global consequences.",
      "Graeme Stewart of cybersecurity firm Check Point said it would not mean \"a complete free-for-all\" as law enforcement must have a warrant to request iCloud data.",
      "But he said other governments may look to replicate the UK's demand of Apple for a so-called \"backdoor\" to encrypted cloud data.",
      "Cybersecurity experts have likened the idea of creating a backdoor to someone leaving their house keys under their doormat - essentially creating a vulnerability which anyone, including bad actors, can exploit.",
      "Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said that if Apple had complied with the request, it would have created a backdoor not just for UK users \"but for people around the world, regardless of where they were or what citizenship they had\".",
      "Apple told the BBC in a statement that it had \"never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will\".",
      "What protections do Google and Android offer?",
      "Like Apple, Google says it uses standard encryption across a range of its services to protect data as it moves between users' devices, its services and data centres.",
      "The search giant, which owns Android, has provided further protections for Android phone system back-ups since 2018.",
      "It uses a mechanism that generates a random security key on a device, which is encrypted by a user's lock-screen passcode, pattern or pin.",
      "Google says it cannot see this security key and that the passcode-protected information is sent securely to high security chips in its data centres.",
      "But the same protections do not extend to Google Photos or content stored in Google Drive - which are not end to end encrypted.",
      "It also has an Advanced Protection Program for people who want further security for their account.",
      "This relies on using passkeys to verify the account holder.",

      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",

      "Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.",

      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

      "US government workers received an email on Saturday afternoon asking them to list their accomplishments from the past week or resign - the latest development in the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce.",
      "The email came after Trump's billionaire confidant Elon Musk posted on X that employees would \"shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week\".",
      "\"Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,\" he wrote.",
      "Musk, as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings.",
      "The email arrived in inboxes shortly after Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac). The messages came with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" from a sender listed as HR.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government's human resources agency, confirmed the email was authentic in a statement to CBS, the BBC's US news partner.",
      "\"As part of the Trump administration's commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce, OPM is asking employees to provide a brief summary of what they did last week by the end of Monday, CC'ing their manager,\" it said. \"Agencies will determine any next steps.\"",
      "In a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to explain their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information - before midnight on Monday.",
      "The message did not mention whether a failure to respond would be considered a resignation.",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees, criticised the message as \"cruel and disrespectful\" and vowed to challenge any \"unlawful terminations\" of federal employees.",
      "\"Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump Administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,\" Everett Kelley, union president, said in a statement.",
      "On Sunday morning, Musk wrote on his social media platform X that \"a large number of responses have been received already\", adding: \"These are the people who should be considered for promotion.\"",
      "A few hours later, Musk said on X that the move was important because \"a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all\".",
      "Musk went on to say that Doge believes \"non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks\", claiming \"outright fraud\" without evidence.",
      "Musk has repeatedly made claims of fraud in defending his team's work across a range of government departments and functions.",

      "Newly-confirmed FBI director Kash Patel told his employees in an email that they should \"pause any responses\" to the OPM memo.",
      "\"FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,\" Patel wrote in a message obtained by CBS News. \"The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with the FBI procedures.\"",
      "The State Department sent a similar message to its employees and said it will respond on behalf of the department.",
      "\"No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,\" an email from Tibor Nagy, acting undersecretary for management, that was obtained by US media said.",
      "The union that represents many government employees, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), was critical of the email and threatened legal action if employees were unlawfully terminated.",
      "\"It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,\" AFGE President Everett Kelley said.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump touted cuts and told a crowd of supporters at Cpac that the work of federal employees had been inadequate because some of them work remotely at least some of the time.",
      "\"We're removing all of the unnecessary, incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats from the federal workforce,\" the president told the crowd at the annual conference in suburban Washington on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"We want to make government smaller, more efficient,\" he added. \"We want to keep the best people, and we're not going to keep the worst people.\"",
      "Elon Musk's team has exacted wide-ranging changes to the US federal infrastructure through Doge and with approval from the White House.",
      "Thousands of government employees at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as other agencies, have been fired in recent weeks.",
      "The email mirrors Musk's handling of employees after he acquired social media platform Twitter, now called X, in 2022. As the staff there shrunk under his ownership, he issued ultimatums that included a now-infamous request to commit to being \"extremely hardcore\" at work or resign.",
      "Trump has repeatedly applauded Musk's government-cutting measures.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk is doing a \"great job\" in reducing the size of the federal government and that he would like to see him \"get more aggressive\" in the pursuit.",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

      "In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsoft's Dublin subsidiary.",
      "A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works.",
      "Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.",
      "Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.",
      "The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.",
      "\"I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,\" says.",
      "A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to \u20ac35,000 ($36,000; \u00a329,000).",
      "But his take home salary was much, much less.",
      "His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.",
      "\"Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,\" he recalls.",
      "Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to \u20ac60,000.",
      "The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.",
      "Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with \"with many more savings\".",
      "Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.",
      "In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.",
      "In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.",
      "After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.",
      "The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.",
      "But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.",
      "\"It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under \u20ac28,000,\" says S\u00e9rgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Cat\u00f3lica Lisbon School of Law.",
      "He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.",
      "Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.",
      "That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD.",
      "\"This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,\" adds Mr Vasques.",
      "Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: \"I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.",
      "\"Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime\".",
      "Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.",
      "According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.",
      "\"The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,\" she said.",
      "Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to \"leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.\"",
      "Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.",
      "\"Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of \u20ac1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me \u20ac4,200 for a junior role.\"",
      "Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" says Mr Almeida.",
      "Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. \"I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.",
      "\"But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.\"",
      "Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.",
      "\"Up until today I never thought about it.\"",
      "Mr Dias agrees: \"Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there\".",

      "A prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body. Prescription pills found in the home were common medications for thyroid and high blood pressure, according to a search warrant.",

      "The circumstances of their death were deemed \"suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation\", the search warrant says, because the worker who called emergency services had found the front door of the property open.",
      "However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside.",
      "\"There was no indication of a struggle,\" said Sheriff Mendoza. \"There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed, you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred.\"",

      "Authorities said Hackman's pacemaker last registered activity on 17 February, adding that this gives them a good assumption that was his last day of life.",
      "But police said it is unclear who died first - Hackman or Arakawa.",
      "The two maintenance workers who found the couple, one of whom called the emergency services, say they last had contact with the couple two weeks earlier.",

      "\"He liked to do Pilates and yoga, and he was continuing to do that several times a week,\" she said. \"So he was in good health.\"",
      "The couple, married in 1991, had had a \"wonderful marriage\", she added.",
      "\"I give credit to his wife, Betsy, for keeping him alive,' she said. '[Betsy] took very, very good care of him and was always looking out for his health.\""

      "\"For those of us who had children on that train, a part of our soul remained there and will never return,\" said Maria Karystianou, the head of the Tempi victims' association, whose daughter Marthi was among those killed in the tragedy.",
      "An inquiry concluded on Thursday that the accident was caused by human error, poor maintenance, and inadequate staffing.",
      "By early afternoon, a group of hooded men began to throw rocks and petrol bombs at police, marring the emotional atmosphere close to parliament.",
      "Police in riot gear responded with tear gas and water cannon as clashes went on for some time around the centre of the capital, in Ermou, Omonia and Propylaia.",
      "Dozens of people were arrested and the trouble flared up again as evening fell.",
      "The violence cast a shadow over the enormous scale of protests in virtually every city in Greece.",
      "\"I am here in memory of the people who were killed in the train crash. We demand justice,\" said 13-year-old Dimitris who had come with his father Petros Polyzos to the largest rally in Greece, in Syntagma Square in downtown Athens.",
      "It was during the night of 28 February 2023 that a passenger train packed with students collided head-on with a goods train near the Tempi gorge in central Greece.",
      "The report by Greece's Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority warned that the safety failings exposed by the crash had not yet been addressed. \"Those children were killed because the train was not safe,\" said the authority's chief Christos Papadimitriou.",
      "The Tempi rail disaster shocked Greeks with many accusing their conservative government of doing too little to shed light on the causes of the tragedy. There is a widely held belief that the government has sought to cover up the role of high-ranking officials.",
      "The entire centre of Athens was crowded with people of all ages and all walks of life, with many saying they were attending a demonstration for the first time in their lives.",
      "Dmitris and his father were among many protesters in Athens, wearing t-shirts that read \"I have no oxygen - justice to the end\", referring to the 57 who died.",
      "Rallies were being organised in 346 cities, across Greece in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Patras and Larissa, as well as in cities across Europe, including Brussels, Rome and several cities in the UK.",
      "The passenger service from Athens to Thessaloniki was crowded with students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent when the train collided with a goods train on the same track outside Larisa.",
      "Seconds afterwards a fireball almost completely destroyed the first two carriages of the train.",
      "In Athens, protesters held placards reading \"My child, call me when you arrive\" and \"No cover-up\".",
      "What happened at the Tempi rail disaster?",
      "Dina Gazi, 62, held white balloons with the names of those who died in the accident. \"I firmly believe that the government is covering up those responsible for the accident\", she told BBC. \"We demand that all the evidence come to light.\"",
      "Shops in the centre had their shutters down, many with messages of sympathy and support in their windows, and ordinary people did not go to work.",
      "Schools were closed, flights and trains cancelled, and the only public transport still operating was taking people to and from Syntagma Square.",
      "Taxi drivers promised to take people to the protest without charge.",
      "In a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everyone's thoughts were with the families of the 57 victims who died, as well as with the wounded and those who survived but carried the memory of that night.",
      "\"Nothing will ever be the same any more,\" he added, speaking of \"fatal human errors coupled with chronic shortcomings of the state\".",
      "In office for almost six years, this is the first time since Mitsotakis was elected that he has been in such a difficult political position. He promised to move \"more dynamically and quickly\" to bring about modern and safe trains.",
      "For Greeks this mass protest was unusual in that it was unrelated to the economy and their personal finances.",
      "Thursday's inquiry found that millions of euros had been paid out to cover the installation of safety systems along the railway, but that the project remained incomplete due to corruption and bureaucracy.",
      "Relatives of those killed in the crash believe the goods train may have been carrying contraband fuel on behalf of a smuggling ring.",
      "\"It is impossible to determine what exactly caused [the fireball], but simulations and expert reports indicate the possible presence of a hitherto unknown fuel,\" the report found.",
      "\"Serious information went missing because the site of the accident was not sealed,\" experts say, increasing public anger and heightening speculation of a cover-up.",
      "Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis denied there was a cover-up and said the allegation was not backed up by the report.",
      "Further allegations have surfaced suggesting orders were given to clear the crash site and \"landfill\" it days after the disaster, which meant that evidence disappeared. But Marinakis said the inquiry report concluded that no political directive was give to alter the scene.",
      "As he stood in the midst of Friday's protest in Syntagma Square, Pavlos Aslanidis spoke about the death of his 26-year-old son Dimitris in the Tempi accident.",
      "\"I don't know how I find the strength to stand,\" he told BBC.",
      "\"My son gives me the strength. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here today demanding justice.\""

      "\"I'm scared\u2026but all I want to do is to talk about the truth,\" she says, in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries.",
      "Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist, Noriyuki Yamaguchi, of rape. He denies the charges.",
      "Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice, after authorities found insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges.",
      "But there is one country where the documentary has still not been aired: Japan - where it has run into huge controversy.",
      "Shiori's former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage that she did not have permission to use, which, they maintain, has violated trust and put her sources at risk.",
      "She defends what she did as necessary for \"public good\".",
      "It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke. Then 28 years old, Shiori had chosen to ignore her family's request to remain silent about the alleged rape. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Yamaguchi - and won $30,000 (\u00a322,917) in damages.",
      "Shiori told the BBC making the film involved \"re-living her trauma\".",
      "\"It took me four years [to make the film] because, emotionally, I was struggling.\"",

      "Shiori claims she was raped following a dinner in Tokyo with Mr Yamaguchi, who has always denied the allegations.",
      "CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel forms part of the more than 400 hours of footage which she has edited for the documentary.",
      "Shiori, who directed and wrote Black Box Diaries, describes the editing process as \"really challenging\".",
      "\"It was like hardcore exposure therapy,\" she says.",
      "But when the film was released, the CCTV footage included in the documentary became a source of friction between the director and the team of lawyers who had helped her win her civil case.",
      "The lawyers stated her use of CCTV footage was unauthorised - and that Shiori had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .",
      "Last week, her former lawyers - led by Yoko Nishihiro - held a press conference, in which she said Shiori's use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.",
      "\"If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,\" Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "Ms Nishihiro claimed Shiori also used unauthorised recordings in the film, which the lawyer only discovered following the screening of the film last July.",
      "The documentary included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower in relation to the investigation process, as well as video of a taxi driver who had provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape.",
      "Both the detective and the taxi driver, the lawyers have argued, were identifiable in the film - and neither had given their consent to be featured.",
      "\"I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,\"  Ms Nishihiro said.",
      "\"I want her to explain and be held accountable.\"",
      "Shiori has previously acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV footage, but has argued that it provided \"the only visual evidence\" of the night she claims she was sexually assaulted.",
      "She said including audio of the police detective was necessary because of \"the cover-up of the investigation\", and has insisted she was releasing the video \"for the public good\".",
      "\"We are standing in different points of view,\" she said, referring to her fall-out with her former lawyers.",
      "\"For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.\"",
      "There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. According to Shiori, \"Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]\".",
      "However, it remains unclear how far the lack of distribution might also be due to legal hurdles.",
      "In her most recent statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals could not be identified. She said a redacted version would be screened at a later stage.",
      "\"There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of - but I wanted to put all of it, and to show we are also human,\" she told the BBC.",

      "She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse.",
      "\"People were telling me you're not crying enough\u2026 you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.\"",
      "Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi  \u2013 they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety.",
      "Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from \"forcible sexual intercourse\" to \"non-consensual sexual intercourse\" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.",
      "Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: \"Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.\"",
      "For now it's unclear if her  film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize.",
      "\"This is my love letter to Japan. I really wish one day I can screen my film, and my family can also watch it,\" she added.",

      "Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.",

      "They were given 72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging \"voluntary returns\".",
      "\"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to,\" Dr Muhindo said.",
      "His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.",

      "Over the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory.",

    "summary": "He also said he would move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, which had been paused.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.",
      "Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.",
      "China's ministry of foreign affairs said it \"strongly\" expressed its \"dissatisfaction and resolute opposition\" to the plans.",
      "Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.",
      "Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.",
      "Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.",
      "He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.",
      "On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.",
      "\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"",
      "She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\".",
      "Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.",
      "Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.",
      "Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.",
      "A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an \"excuse\" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the \"strictest\" drug control policies in the world.",
      "\"Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,\" he said.",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.",
      "\"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\".",
      "\"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University.",
      "On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.",
      "Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.",
      "Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.",
      "Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.",
      "Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.",
      "\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.",
      "The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.",
      "But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.",
      "China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.",
      "Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg559y0803o",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 03:19:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.",
    "story": [
      "The Cook Islands may be small but the ambitions of its leader are mighty.",
      "A range of deals Prime Minister Mark Brown signed with China without consulting the public or New Zealand \u2013 an ally to which the Cooks is closely tied \u2013 has caused increasing irritation and concern.",
      "The agreements are the first of their kind with a country that is not a traditional ally. They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.",
      "Brown says his decisions will be based on the \"long-term interests\" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change.",
      "Not everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally.",
      "New Zealand said it was \"blindsided\" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.",
      "He has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening.",
      "The rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.",
      "But now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable.",
      "Mining the Pacific \u2013 future proofing or fool's gold?",
      "A rare behind the scenes look at the Pacific power tussle",
      "The Cook Islands has had what's known as a \"free association\" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.",
      "The two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island M\u0101ori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand M\u0101ori.",
      "The deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry.",
      "\"[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the M\u0101ori word for New Zealand] \u2013 they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,\" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China.",
      "In a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: \"Stay connected with NZ\". Others waved their New Zealand passports.",
      "\"Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?\" Ms Tuara said. \"We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us \u2013 for our children, for their future.\"",
      "But for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.",
      "China specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that \"the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities\".",
      "He believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are \"all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.\"",
      "Testing the waters",
      "While the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.",
      "In response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.",
      "Last week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.",
      "\"It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],\" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.",
      "\"It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.\"",
      "China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it.",
      "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.",
      "\"I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,\" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. \"China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?\"",
      "A balancing act",
      "Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits \"we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality\".",
      "In speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.",
      "\"[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,\" Philipp Ivanov says. \"Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.\"",
      "But it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.",
      "\"Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make \u2026 and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,\" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "But, he adds, they also have \"enormous commonalities\" - China is Australia's largest  trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.",
      "\"So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.\"",
      "It's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.",
      "Although many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.",
      "And now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.",
      "\"I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,\" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.",
      "\"I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.\"",

      "The report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians\".",
      "The 19-page report contains much that is already known about what led to catastrophic loss of about 1,200 lives when approximately 5,000 gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups stormed into Israel, also taking 251 hostages in the process.",

      "They were Israel's 'eyes on the border' - their warnings went unheard",

      "The report says the military regarded Gaza as a secondary security threat, with priority given to Iran and Hezbollah. Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was \"paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative\".",
      "The military had chosen a \"conflict management\" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was \"neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war\" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.",
      "Evidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as \"unrealistic or unfeasible\", reflecting \"Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat\".",

      "However, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.",

      "It calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, \"fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement\".",
      "It says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:22:26 GMT",
    "summary": "In many cases, courts criticised the police for lapses in investigation, even \"falsely implicating\" people.",
    "story": [
      "Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved.",
      "A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges.",
      "More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs.",
      "The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was \"pre-planned\" as a part of a larger conspiracy to \"threaten India's unity\" by the people who were protesting against the law.",
      "They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the \"main conspiracy case\". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin.",
      "BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions.",
      "More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions.",
      "Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial.",
      "In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows.",
      "A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing \"predetermined chargesheets\" that \"falsely implicated\" the accused.",
      "In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible.",
      "Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out.",
      "Watch: Five years on, cases collapse in courts",
      "Watch: Five years on, cases collapse in courts",
      "In two orders, the judge said that he could not \"restrain\" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the \"failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation\" would \"torment the sentinels of democracy\". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any \"real or effective investigation\".",
      "The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a \"credible, fair and impartial\" way.",
      "Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation.",
      "Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots.",
      "He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others.",
      "Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson.",
      "\"Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van,\" he told the BBC.",
      "When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting.",
      "\"They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims,\" Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries.",
      "In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin.",
      "In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been \"artificially prepared\", and that \"in all probabilities\" the shop was burnt by a \"mob of persons from the Hindu community\".",
      "It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened.",
      "Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed.",
      "\"All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy,\" said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father.",
      "\"In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence.\"",
      "He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. \"If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them,\" he added.",
      "In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots.",
      "The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client.",
      "In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up.",
      "In its order in January, the court ruled that the police \"manipulated\" the video to \"frame\" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the \"actual culprits\".",
      "It also asked the commissioner of Delhi police to take appropriate action against the investigating officer in the case. The police did not respond to BBC Hindi's question on whether this had been done.",
      "Mr Bhati, who spent four months in prison, refused to comment, saying he did not wish to discuss his \"ordeal\".",
      "With so many acquittals, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said, the prosecution and police \"should sit down to introspect what they have achieved in five years\".",
      "He also said that \"accountability needs to be fixed on the prosecution as well if the arrest is found to be illegal or unnecessary\".",
      "\"If the prosecution puts someone  in jail because they have the power to do so or because they want to do so, they should not be allowed to get away with it if the incarceration is found to be illegal or unnecessary,\" he added.",
      "Even as some cases fall apart in courts, many of those arrested are still languishing in jail awaiting a trial.",
      "Gulfisha Fatima, a 33-year-old PhD aspirant, is among 12 activists who are still in jail on charges of being \"conspirators\" of the riots.",
      "Her family said three other police cases were lodged against her and she got bail in all of them. But she continues to face incarceration in a fourth case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) - the stringent anti-terror law that sets exceptionally challenging conditions for bail.",
      "\"Since she's gone to jail, with every hearing we hope she will finally come out,\" her father Syed Tasneef Hussain told the BBC.",
      "In Ms Fatima's case, after months of hearing the bail plea, the judge from the Delhi High Court got transferred in 2023, and now the entire case is being heard again.",
      "\"Sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to see her or if I'll die before that,\" Mr Hussain said.",

      "\"Too small\" is what one very senior US general said in a private briefing on a visit to the UK.",
      "According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Russia's military expenditure is now higher than Europe's total defence spending, in terms of purchasing parity power. It's increased by 41% and is now the equivalent of 6.7% of GDP.  In contrast, the UK will be spending just 2.5% by 2027.",
      "President Trump's comments underscore the reality that he's not contemplating putting American troops on the ground in Ukraine to police any ceasefire. Any US presence will be economic, to exploit mining interests.",
      "He suggests that that in itself might be a deterrent to Russia attacking again. But even his administration thinks there must be some hard power too - provided by others.  It'll be up to European nations to do that. The question is not just whether Europe has the will: does it have the numbers too?",
      "The short answer is no. That is why Sir Keir Starmer has been pressing for additional US security guarantees from the world's most powerful military.",
      "Britain is not alone in cutting its armed forces in response to the end of the Cold War. That trend in Europe is slowly being reversed, with more nations increasing defence spending.",
      "But Europe, on its own, would not be able to provide a force of 100-200,000 international troops, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggests would be needed to deter Russia from attacking again.",
      "Instead, Western officials have said they're thinking of a force of up to 30,000 troops. European jets and warships would help monitor Ukraine's airspace and shipping lanes.",
      "That force would be focused on providing \"reassurance\" at key sites - Ukraine's cities, ports and nuclear power stations. They would not be placed anywhere near the current front lines in Eastern Ukraine. European fighter jets and warships would also monitor Ukraine's air space and shipping lanes.",
      "Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence?",
      "How much do Nato members spend on defence?",
      "Hegseth sets out hard line on European defence and Nato",
      "But these same Western officials acknowledge that this would not be enough, hence the calls for a US \"backstop\" - \"to have the confidence that whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia\" and to \"give the prime minister confidence that he can deploy British forces safely\".",
      "Officials believe that, at the very least, the US could provide oversight to any European forces with a \"command and control element\" and US fighter jets ready to respond from its airbases in Poland and Romania. Europe cannot match American space-based surveillance or intelligence-gathering capabilities.",
      "It could also agree to continuing to supply Ukraine with weapons.",
      "While Europe has recently overtaken the US in terms of the proportion of Western weapons supplied to Ukraine, one Western source said the US had provided \"the cream\" - such as long range missiles and air defence systems.",
      "European nations also do not have the necessary enablers to conduct large-scale military operations on their own. The supply of Western weapons to Ukraine has been dependent on US logistics.",
      "Nato's bombing campaign over Libya in 2011 also highlighted deficiencies - with European nations supposedly taking the lead, but still dependent on US support. Allies relied on US refuelling tankers and US targeting.",
      "But Sir Keir Starmer appears to have left Washington without any guarantees of US military support. Speaking to the BBC this morning, UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting suggested that Donald Trump's re-commitment to Nato's Article 5 - whereby an attack on one ally would be interpreted as an attack on all - might be enough.",
      "But the US Defence Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has previously stated that any international troops sent to Ukraine will be neither a Nato force nor covered by its treaty. At present, there is no such Nato-style security guarantee.",
      "Europe's strength of will is being tested. The prime minister, who's convening a meeting of leaders this weekend, will soon find out whether warm words from Donald Trump are enough to convince others to join the UK in putting boots on the ground.",
      "France is the only other major European power that so far appears to be willing to do the same. Some Northern European nations - Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic states - are willing to consider a commitment, but again would like US security guarantees. Spain, Italy and Germany are so far opposed.",
      "Sir Keir may still believe there's room for negotiation, that the US might still be willing to back a European force.  But as for Donald Trump's question - would  Britain be able to take on Russia's military? Even though Russian forces have been weakened, the answer is no."

      "Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge.",
      "These are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world.",
      "Then there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines.",
      "\"The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,\" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus.",
      "North Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there.",
      "Since then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back.",
      "But after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast.",
      "Last Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip.",
      "Among them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy.",
      "Ben Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to \"being on a school trip\". \"You can't leave the hotel without the guides,\" he said.",
      "\"A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,\" said Mike. \"I've never had to do that anywhere in the world.\"",
      "Despite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. \"Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see.\"",
      "On his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them.",
      "For now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the \"big-hitting monuments\" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control.",
      "Set up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely.",
      "Joe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. \"I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,\" he said.",
      "Joe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected.",
      "\"This was the only place people weren't expecting us,\" Joe said. \"It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it.\"",
      "But according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals.",
      "Covid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. \"On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks.\" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people.",
      "It is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering.",
      "Local guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left.",
      "Even Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. \"Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,\" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. \"It felt like they opened the doors just for us.\"",
      "The regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise \"the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed\".  His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling \"his grandma's living room\". The whole window was cracked.",
      "\"They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there\", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help.",
      "One of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg.",
      "They knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. \"I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me.\"",
      "Such conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk.",
      "Mike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. \"I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,\" he said.",
      "\"Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre.\"",
      "For Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: \"North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important.\"",
      "But tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime.",
      "\"This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,\" she said.",
      "One conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. \"I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,\" he said.",

      "Journalists in the room watched with gaping mouths as an extraordinary exchange followed.",
      "\"You've done enough talking. You're not winning this,\" Trump told him at one point. \"You gotta be thankful. You don't have the cards.\"",
      "\"I'm not playing cards,\" Zelensky replied. \"I'm very serious, Mr President. I'm the president in a war.\"",

      "As reporters exited the Oval Office, many stood still in a state of shock. In the White House briefing room, where the exchange was replayed shortly afterwards, the rest of the media who hadn't been in the room watched in disbelief.",
      "Confusion ensued. There were immediate questions about whether the planned news conference would go ahead \u2013 or if the much-anticipated deal between the US and Ukraine over mineral resources would even be signed.",

      "\"We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,\" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens.",
      "The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law.",
      "The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action.",
      "Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul.",
      "From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored.",

      "\"They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering.\"",
      "Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime.",
      "The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power.",
      "However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.",
      "The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask.",
      "\"On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,\" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction.",
      "The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within.",
      "The interior ministry says the cameras have \"significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders\". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures.",
      "However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long.",
      "Amnesty International say installing cameras \"under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces\".",
      "By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment.

      "But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule.",
      "\"Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,\" she says.",
      "\"There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,\" she says.",
      "Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used.",
      "The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they \"are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge\".",
      "The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment.",
      "Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system.",
      "In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home.",
      "\"They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,\" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; \u00a354) a month.",
      "The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power.",

      "They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.",
      "But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.",
      "The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people \u2013 more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.",
      "The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.",
      "He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.",
      "Casinos, high-rises and fraud: The BBC visits a bizarre city built on scams",
      "The Chinese mafia's downfall in a lawless casino town",
      "Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.",
      "Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.",
      "\"It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.\"",
      "Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.",
      "Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.",
      "China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.",
      "Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.",
      "He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.",
      "\"They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.\"",
      "Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.",
      "He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.",
      "The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.",
      "It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.",
      "That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.",
      "The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.",
      "Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.",
      "Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.",
      "A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.",
      "The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.",
      "The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.",
      "Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.",
      "Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.",
      "\"If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it \u2013 we must work seriously,\" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,\" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.",
      "\"We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.\"",
      "Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.",
      "But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.",
      "Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave.",
      "On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky met US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.",
      "But after Zelensky left early following a fiery exchange with Trump and Vice-President JD Vance, the White House announced that the deal had not been signed.",
      "Zelensky previously said he hoped the \"preliminary\" agreement with the US would \"lead to further deals\", but confirmed no US security guarantees had yet been agreed - something he had been pushing for.",
      "Trump had said a deal would help US taxpayers \"get their money back\" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war, but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.",
      "What are the terms of the deal?",
      "On Wednesday, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement. It was published on Friday morning.",
      "The preliminary agreement envisages that an \"investment fund\" will be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction.",
      "Shmyhal said Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on \"equal terms\".",
      "According to the deal, Ukraine will contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund will then invest \"to promote the safety, security and prosperity of Ukraine\".",
      "Meanwhile, the agreement says the US government will, subject to US law, \"maintain a long-term financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically prosperous Ukraine\".",
      "Zelensky acknowledged the fund, but told the BBC on Wednesday it was \"too early to talk about money\".",
      "The agreement states that the US will own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law.",
      "Disagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what appears to be a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky.",
      "The Ukrainian president rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (\u00a3395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.",
      "\"The US administration started with a deal that challenged Ukraine's sovereignty, then pushed an exploitative one that would bankrupt the country,\" Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and head of Kyiv school of economics, told the BBC.",
      "\"Now, they've shifted to a reasonable deal with co-ownership and no direct claims on past aid. That could actually benefit Ukraine.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (\u00a3237bn) and $350bn (\u00a3276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to \"get that money back\" through a deal.",
      "But German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.",
      "Does the deal include a security guarantee?",
      "Zelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.",
      "But on Wednesday, he said no such guarantee had been made.",
      "\"I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,\" the Ukrainian leader explained.",
      "Asked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: \"I want to find a Nato path or something similar.",
      "\"If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.\"",
      "Despite this, the published agreement says the US supports \"Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace\".",
      "He said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump \"agree on security guarantees\" and decide on how to \"tie this preliminary agreement\" to a US security guarantee.",
      "Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees \"beyond... very much\", adding that responsibility for this would now fall to Europe.",
      "But he added that the presence of US workers on Ukrainian soil would provide \"automatic security\".",
      "The prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.",
      "Trump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get \"the right to fight on\" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition \"until we have a deal with Russia\".",
      "The US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.",
      "When will the deal be signed?",
      "Trump had said the two would sign the deal at Friday's meeting at the White House.",
      "Ukrainian PM Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine had prepared a final version of the agreement, though Zelensky aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said that only a framework agreement was due to be signed.",
      "But nothing at all was signed during the visit, which instead saw Trump and Zelensky descend into a heated exchange in the Oval Office.",
      "At one point, a furious Trump said Zelensky was not grateful enough for the US's support during the war, and that he was \"gambling with World War Three\".",
      "He said Zelensky had to \"make a deal or we're out\", adding: \"You don't have the cards.\"",
      "Zelensky said there should be \"no compromises\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Not long after - and well ahead of schedule - the Ukrainian president was seen leaving the White House.",
      "The White House then announced that the deal had not been agreed - and said Trump had decided to call off the signing ceremony himself.",
      "The US president wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelensky had \"disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office\". He added: \"He can come back when he is ready for peace.\"",
      "It is now unclear when the deal might be signed, if at all.",
      "What minerals does Ukraine have?",
      "Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's \"critical raw materials\" are in Ukraine.",
      "This includes some 19 million tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium and lithium. It says it has substantial amounts of the world's rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world - but these claims are disputed.",
      "Also, some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "There are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines.",
      "A quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.",
      "Another issue is that it will be some time before anyone sees any material benefits from the deal.",

    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 22:32:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Tamil Nadu\u2019s iron artefacts may predate Turkey's Anatolia, reshaping early Iron Age history.",
    "story": [
      "For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.",
      "Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.",
      "Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953\u20133,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent.",
      "\"The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,\" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.",
      "The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as \"Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?\" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.",
      "Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions.  He believes that iron technology likely emerged \"independently in multiple regions\".",
      "Also, the \"earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly\".",
      "If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, \"it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records\", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find \"suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world\".",
      "Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.",
      "Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.",
      "Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.",
      "At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.",
      "Some finds are particularly striking.",
      "Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th\u201315th Century BC.",
      "This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.",
      "\"We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,\" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there \"were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time\".",
      "Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community.",
      "The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.",
      "To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,\" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me.",
      "\"The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,\" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.",
      "\"What's clear now,\" she adds, \"is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.\"",
      "Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, \"what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,\" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.",
      "However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, \"Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.\"",
      "Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was \"just the starting point\".",
      "\"We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.\"",

      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",

      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",

      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",
      "11. Some nominees were conspicuous by their absence",
      "Understandably, not every nominee was available to attend the dinner - best supporting actor frontrunner Kieran Culkin was among the stars missing from the class photo.",
      "But others were conspicuous by their absence, most notably Emilia P\u00e9rez star Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "The actress is persona non grata in Hollywood at the moment, after some historic tweets she posted resurfaced in recent weeks, severely damaging the film's awards chances in many categories.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0w0x28yxo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:59:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As Syria's interim leader plans its future, Kurds in the north-east are battling Turkish-backed forces.",
    "story": [
      "To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads.",
      "This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces.",
      "But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain.",
      "As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting.",
      "The fight against IS",
      "A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014.",
      "IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months.",
      "Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary.",
      "At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).",
      "As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives.",
      "But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate.",
      "For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. \"Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,\" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. \"It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it.\"",
      "Conflict with Turkey",
      "The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace.",
      "Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border.",
      "Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border.",
      "As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF.",
      "Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: \"Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege.\"",
      "In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years.",
      "Newrouz Ahmad says that having \"defeated IS in Kobane\u2026 we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too\".",
      "At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. \"I am 60,\" he says.",
      "It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed.",
      "And now the threat of another battle is looming.",
      "Reported attacks on civilians",
      "Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit.",
      "In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years.",
      "She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing.",
      "The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing.  The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured.",
      "\"An old man next to me was also injured,\" she tells me from her bed.",
      "\"I lost some blood\u2026 but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,\" she adds.",
      "Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an \"apparent war crime\" by the Turkish-SNA coalition.",
      "The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that \"reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth\" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a \"conflict-ridden area on purpose\" to use them as \"human shields\u2026 in order to not to lose control on the said dam\".",
      "It accused the SDF of using \"violence and terror\" to pursue \"its own separatist agenda\", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs.",
      "The Damascus dilemma",
      "Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place.",
      "The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east.",
      "But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies \u2013 Turkey.",
      "And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited.",
      "Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before.",
      "But the two sides have still not reached an agreement.",
      "\"In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,\" he says, adding: \"In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control.",
      "\"But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,\" he says.",
      "For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS.",
      "Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells.",
      "But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence.",
      "It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi.",
      "\"If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,\" he warns. \"That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters.\"",
      "Uncertain future",
      "There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks.",
      "The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle.",
      "\"So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,\" she says. \"Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?\"",
      "Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life.",
      "\"If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?\" she asks.",
      "So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?"

    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

      "Gene Hackman and his wife\u00a0Betsy Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning, authorities in New Mexico announced Friday, after the couple were found dead in their home earlier this week.",

      "Asked if investigators have been able to determine which of the two died first, Mendoza replied, \"That's a question that's we want answered. That's a very hard to determination to make.\"",

      "\"I'd like to say hi to my mom. Unfortunately, she's watching Ted Koppel. That's her idea of a son!\"",
      "\u2014 Johnny Carson, outset of The Tonight Show monologue, August 6, 1982 (ten weeks before his 57th birthday",
      "\"One got the impression that Johnny's relationship with his mother was complex. Once, when I came into his office, he told me that his mother had just angrily hung up on him. I asked why, and he said, 'I called and asked her how things were going. She said, \"Not so good. Yesterday, we put Walter Burbage in the ground.\" I said, 'Was he dead?'\"",
      "\u2014Emailed anecdote from Carson monologue writer Michael Barrie",
      "The complexities of Ruth Elizabeth Hook Carson\u2014woman of grand flair and mannered propriety, poker-game hellcat, preternaturally withholding, crisp, exacting, colorful, misunderstood\u2014imbued her son Johnny, in particular, with even deeper complexities. But without them, he would not have grown into what he needed to be. Which is how it has worked, vis-\u00e0-vis powerful men re: their mothers, since time and nimble psyches began ticking. Arguably, traces of this mother mixed throughout the bulk content of her middle child's infamous tightly packed suitcase. The parts of her that he would directly adopt into his own makeup were also, in no small measure, the same parts of her to which he was forced to adapt\u2014or steel himself against\u2014from tender years onward.",
      "So it followed that he had sired three sons who would also never quite believe they were unconditionally adored (or, at times, much cared for) \u2014no matter that his own cloistered heart wanted far better for them than he had ever gotten. Demonstrating the difference, of course, was the big hitch, since no affirming example had been drummed into him. Instead, his protectiveness for the boys showed up as a brisk tough love (with sweet dashes of twinkle)\u2014which mostly left them wanting, especially in a household that grew more and more unstable and where their father was mostly missing in action. Thus, the circle stayed unbroken\u2014a fact he would later grasp with sizable remorse. Except it was a frozen, paralytic remorse that all but stymied him from correcting matters. \"It was very hard,\" says Suzanne Pleshette, who saw the toll of these struggles across many years. \"I know all of the children of all of the big stars. And all of these kids have a lot of legitimate complaints\u2014and yet it's these guys' demons that made them who they are, and also who their children ended up becoming. Johnny's relationship with his sons was difficult and bittersweet\u2014especially knowing that he felt that he hadn't given what they deserved to have. In some ways, he had probably replicated what was painful for him. And he didn't quite have the ability to know how to fix it.\"",
      "At best, he did find a way to address that niggling impulse\u2014by proxy, anyway. Long after the die was cast and the boys had become men, he would softly bolster younger fathers who found themselves in grim marital straits, almost wistfully forking over his two cents in a manner akin to don't-do-as-I-do-just-do-as-I-say. (It was a singular exception to his tendency to stifle advice dispensation.) The comedian and fail-safe guest Robert Klein, whose only child, a son, was born in 1983, had been one such beneficiary\u2014absorbing repeated doses of concern during Tonight Show commercial breaks (which was when the host deigned to socialize, selectively but also genuinely, with preferred or privileged seat-fillers). \"He was very, very kind to me when I was going through a terrible divorce [in 1988],\" Klein told People. \"He advised me to make sure to let my boy know that I love him very much, and he kept telling me this over and over.\"",
      "Like any comedy pro, Johnny Carson knew that misadventures in fatherhood were tantamount to gold, especially after intervening years, or decades, had diluted whatever traumas may have been part of the payoff. (See comedy theorem of tragedy-plus-time-equals-funny.) Like the night of December 10, 1981, when he was caught, post-commercial break, interacting with his Burbank studio constituency: \"I was telling the audience the story about the guinea pigs,\" he explained to viewers, a bit ominously. \"I don't want to repeat it\u2014maybe later. But never buy your children little guinea pigs in New York and then put them outside at night. They were hard as a carp!\" This material, of course, was basically the benign stuff of typical suburban cocktail party patter\u2014except his shaggy parenting tales were magnified via coast-to-coast broadcast, albeit in distant aftermath. \"I know my dad enjoyed wearing the mantle of fatherhood with his friends and acquaintances,\" Carson's youngest son Cory mordantly notes. \"Always been a part of the irony for me. And it's okay.\"",
      "But The Tonight Show was always going to be where he shared himself most generously (eking out, via chatty dollops of personal history, the autobiography he refused to write) and, during those confessional or conversational asides, his sons' names and pursuits would often trip eagerly\u2014and proudly\u2014from his tongue. As these things went, his fame would certainly, if unintentionally, form their lives as much as he fought against it by leaning hard on them. Phil Donahue aimed in early 1970 to pry open that worm-can, asking him: \"When you first signed an autograph in front of your kids, how did they respond? Did it affect them in a way that undermines your ability to be their father?\" To which he replied, after a confounded pause, \"I don't know. It's hard to ask your own children.\"",
      "Email from Cory Carson, August 2, 2005: \u00a0My feelings about my Dad are quite mixed. Professionally he was without a doubt most suited for the career he sought. \u00a0The right man for the job and ... at the right time in history. On the personal side of the coin, he left his kids and family as a consequence to [pursue] that professional end and, as a result, made life most difficult for those left to watch the \"magic\" unfold without the benefit of experiencing it with him. I think he was typical of most entertainers \u00a0in that area though, so whaddaya gonna do? Work was easy for him, family was not.",
      "Email from Cory Carson, August 3, 2005: \u00a0I understand my dad's foibles better than any, been a lifetime study. \u00a0I am free of feeling unworthy though, that was a biggie many years ago. \u00a0Imagine witnessing the little guests that would frequent the show and having my Dad absolutely enthralled with their every word. What did they have that we didn't? Ten minutes of material! Hey!!! (snare-kick sound) \u00a0Show bidness. Gotta love it.",
      "***",
      "While Carson's love for his sons rarely manifested in hugs and attaboys, it was nonetheless tucked away in subterranean seams awaiting extraction. On June 21, 1991, it exploded to the surface. Carson was only a month into his valedictory season when, toward the end of a two-week vacation, he learned that his son and middle child, Rick, had died in a car accident near Morro Bay, on the Southern California coast. Investigators determined that the thirty-nine-year-old amateur photographer had likely been taking or setting up for photos when his SUV plunged 125 feet down an embankment, fatally injuring him. There was talk of Carson's returning to The Tonight Show as scheduled, but he was too devastated and needed more time. Only a few weeks later, however, he was back on the job.",
      "\"The first time I spoke with him [on the phone], I didn't know what to say,\" says Helen Sanders, Carson's longtime executive assistant. \"The thing that came out of my mouth was 'I just wish I could give you a big hug.' Afterward, I thought, What a stupid thing to say! Why did I say that? \u00a0I felt so dumb. The day he came [back] to do the show, the first thing I noticed is that he had no energy. He always had a sparkling energy; you could see the sparks come off him. But he was like a shell. It scared me. I said, 'Hi.' I didn't really know what to say; I was trying to act normal. He just stood there and said, 'Can I have that hug?' I got up, and I just gave him a big hug. We hugged and cried together. I felt him just take my energy. I feel really good about the fact that I made a really safe, calm place for him to be that afternoon.\"",
      "When Carson's writers gathered that day for their regular meeting, he told them, \"Don't ever go through this, guys.\" Then it was business as usual, the show going on as it must. Rick had been a second assistant director on the pilot for Amen, recalls Ed. Weinberger, a short-lived Carson Productions president and former Tonight Show writer. \"But he wasn't prepared to work, and I feel very bad about that. That's a very serious regret that I was not more patient or understanding\u2014but [we were] in the midst of doing the show and with actors saying, 'He can't do his job' and 'I didn't come out of my dressing room because I didn't know that I was due.'\" There were all kinds of things, so I let him go. He called me one night when he had obviously been drinking, and he said, 'I know why ... I understand ... You're a lot like my father \u2026' He went on for thirty-five, forty minutes just rambling about who he was, what he was. He was lost.\" Rick's pal Danny Robinson, son of Tonight Show talent manager Bud Robinson, knew him on a much different level. \"He was hilarious\u2014killer sense of humor,\" Robinson says, adding that of Carson's sons, Rick most closely reflected his father. \"He had the same sort of energy, the same sense of humor.\" Carson, too, saw the resemblance, telling second ex Joanne that \"he was so like me in so many ways.\" But Carson could be cold and cruel. According to Tonight Show associate producer Tom Boles, \"there was not a mean bone in [Rick's] body. I think his own individuality was so eclipsed by Johnny's mega-stardom that he was unable to exist as his own individual. It was impossible for him to be anything more than Johnny's son.\" Boles also notes, \"I would see [Johnny's youngest son] Cory in the halls of NBC. He'd be around the Tonight Show irregularly. You could tell he didn't bear that same weight that Rick did. It's hard to put your finger on Rick. There was something troubled about him. You kind of felt bad for the guy.\" After Rick died, Danny and Boles attended a memorial that Rick's girlfriend and some of his friends held at the tiny and historic Little Brown Church, on Coldwater Canyon Avenue in Studio City. Attendees received laminated memorial cards that bore one of Rick's lush landscape photos\u2014a blue sky, brown mountains, and water. On its flip side were Rick's birthdate and words typically attributed to Scottish poet Thomas Campbell: \"To live in the hearts of those you leave behind is not to die.\" By Robinson's account, former Tomorrow Show host (and Rick's former boss when he worked on the program as a stage manager and associate director) Tom Snyder attended. So did various Tonight Show staffers, people from the Today show, and others who'd known Rick. \"Johnny didn't come, and I get it,\" Robinson says. \"I buried my parents, and that was as hard as anything I ever want to do in my life. And I've buried, unfortunately, enough friends. I can't imagine burying your child. But here's what Johnny said: 'Where I go, the press will go. I don't want it to turn into a circus.' Personally, I would have loved for Johnny to be there because he would have gotten to see a side of Ricky that maybe he never saw.\" During Rick's stint at the Tomorrow Show, he'd become friends with producer and director Andy Friendly (son of CBS legend Fred Friendly). \"His death, following a difficult time in his life, was devastating to me, and to all of his friends and Tomorrow Show colleagues,\" Friendly wrote in an excerpt from his 2017 memoir Willing to Be Lucky: Adventures in Life and Television. \"I wrote a long letter to his dad expressing my sympathy and describing the kind, fun-loving, great person and colleague Rick was.\" Carson replied with a brief note of thanks.",
      "During the first Tonight Show taping after Rick's death, on July 17, 1991, Carson made no mention of the sensitive subject up top. (\"We were all on tenterhooks, walking on eggshells,\" Ed McMahon says. \"Worrying about how he was gonna do the show.\") Instead, he delivered a joke-filled monologue and interviewed guests Bernadette Peters (who also sang) and Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson before delivering a eulogy for Rick from behind his desk near the show's end. For such an interior and private man it was no small feat, and at times he stifled tears. Two days after Rick died, he said, Carson's good friend, the actor and director Michael Landon, had called to offer consolation. Landon was deeply unwell at the time and died of pancreatic cancer the following week. \"So these have not been the most happy several weeks,\" Carson said. With a photo of his handsome boy displayed on monitors\u2014not to be \"mawkish,\" he assured, but because it was a better representation than the driver's license shot used in press reports\u2014Carson described Rick as \"an exuberant young man, fun to be around. When Rick was around you wanted to smile.\" Carson briefly glanced off to the wings, where he could hear de Cordova on the phone with director Bobby Quinn, letting him know they were running long. De Cordova also flashed Carson a stunningly ill-timed sign to wrap things up. (The gaffe damaged their decades-long relationship, though they reportedly mended fences before de Cordova died in 2001.) Tamping down his anger like a musket ball, Carson went on as if nothing had happened: \"He tried so darn hard to please. He had a laugh that was contagious as could be. Luckily he left some marvelous memories for the whole family, and that's what you kind of hang on to.\" A montage of Rick's photographs followed, accompanied by Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble's languid jazzy-bluesy tune \"Riviera Paradise\"\u2014urban vistas and rural horizons; shores beneath mountains and crashing surf; a wildflower field and a poplar grove. (\"This one goes out to anyone who's suffering in any way,\" Vaughn said before an October 10, 1989, performance of the song at Austin City Limits.) The moving segment lasted five and a half minutes. Prolonged emotionalism, even in the wake of such a crushing personal loss, wasn't Carson's style. Offstage, though, his quiet grieving never ended. Recalling the impact of Rick's death two decades after it happened, Severinsen said, \"Johnny was never the same, ever, after that.\"",

      "\"It's kind of the American 'War and Peace,'\" Mirren said in an interview. \"It's kind of looking at the big movement of history in America, hopefully with honesty and truth, and not shying away from the incredible racism, the violence, the brutality, the courage.\"",
      "Unlike many Hollywood westerns of the past, \"1923\" avoids romanticizing the era.",
      "\"I think it's a period that has been looked at over and over again, and romanticized, and whitewashed, certainly throughout the '50s and '60s,\" Mirren noted.",
      "To prepare for the role, Mirren attended \"Cowboy Camp\" where she overcame her fear of horses and learned to drive a horse-drawn buggy.",
      "The series reunites Mirren with Ford nearly 40 years after they first worked together on \"The Mosquito Coast.\" At that time, Mirren was already celebrated for her Shakespearean stage roles in Britain.",
      "\"I absolutely adore him,\" Mirren said of Ford. \"His trajectory and the way he is is so remarkable and a lovely thing to be in the presence of.\"",
      "Mirren's illustrious career includes an Academy Award\u00a0for \"The Queen,\" three Golden Globes, five Emmys and a Tony Award. Her versatility has allowed her to portray characters ranging from an embittered housekeeper in \"Gosford Park\" to a hard-boiled assassin in \"Red\" and even the narrator in Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie.\"",
      "When asked about her attraction to strong female characters, Mirren explained, \"Your dream as an actress is to find a role that \u2013 especially as a woman, incidentally \u2013 that has agency and passion and courage.\"",
      "She particularly values portraying the complex relationship between Cara and Jacob Dutton.",

But Russian oligarchs are not to be taken lightly, nor the strongmen that are tasked with righting a perceived wrong.",
      "However, writer-director Sean Baker is not interested in familiar, stereotypical mob muscle.

      "Throughout most of the film, Borisov's performance is not dependent upon dialogue; he's an observer, an instrument of others, and a guardian. In this scene, Igor and Anora seem to recognize that \u2013   for all that has happened between them \u2013  there is nonetheless a connection that transcends their circumstances. Non-spoiler alert: I will not give away the actions preceding and following this clip, but they are at the heart of the film's tremendous emotional impact:",
      "In an interview for the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, Borisov was asked to describe his character's transition, from being a threat to Anora, to becoming a vulnerable, empathetic confidant, feeling things about her he didn't expect. [Indeed, Igor shows more compassion to Anora than anyone else in the movie.]",
      "\"I don't know how to answer, 'cause if I could explain it by words, I better to be a writer than an actor,\" he said. \"That's why I tried to explain by [actions]. It's thanks to Sean, his editing, because he used some right moments, and that's why you could feel what [Igor] feels. \u2026 And thanks to Mikey, she just going forward to her goal, I'm just going behind her and trying to help and protect. That's it.\"",
      "Borisov told the Associated Press that the theme of the film was about making connections: \"Connection between people, between mentalities and nationalities and cultures. Especially today, because I think that it's possible, this connection, between everybody of us. Of course, it's not easy. I know, and everybody knows, but it's possible. And during this shoot I feel this \u2013 that we are different but at the same time we're absolutely similar. And I feel that humans, in the most important things, are similar and I feel everybody of us like children and souls, you know. For me, it's about connection between souls, and it's possible.\"",
      "Born in Moscow, Borisov's credits include \"The Bull,\" \"Kalashnikov,\" \"Compartment No. 6,\" and the Netflix film \"Silver Skates.\" For his performance in \"Anora\" he received Golden Globe, BAFTA and two Screen Actors Guild nominations. He tied with Kieran Culkin (\"A Real Pain\") for best supporting performance from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.",
      "He was in a car with his wife and two daughters when he heard the Oscar nominations being announced. \"My [category] was first, and my name was first. And after that, she starts screaming and crying. And after that, I lose everything. \u2026 It's a very emotional moment, I can say, for everybody.\"",

      "In this scene, Benji reacts to the absurdity of riding a train in comfort compared to the situation facing Jews on trains in 1940s Poland:",
      "\"I feel like I easily could've gone down that path,\" Culkin said of Benji. \"There was something in that that I recognized as myself, but I'm not that guy at all. But I think I'm worried that I easily could've become that guy, [had I not] married, kids, or figured out how to, you know, get my s*** together.\"",
      "Jesse Eisenberg, the writer-director of \"A Real Pain,\" told \"Sunday Morning\" he hadn't seen Culkin's work on-screen (he avoided watching \"Succession,\" he said, because he was afraid of how great it might be). But he had auditioned with him for 2009's \"Adventureland.\" \"He came into this audition room and started, like, beating me up like in the script and making fun of me\u2026 and being so brilliantly funny, and then walked out of the room, and we were like, 'That was brilliant and aggressive, fascinating and so brazen.' And so, when I was thinking about who would work well with me in this movie playing a character who comes on that trip that I plan and who kind of beats me up but also charms the group at my expense, I was thinking, Oh yeah, that's the relationship I had briefly with this brilliant actor \u2026 That seemed to me just so perfect.",
      "\"And then, Kieran showed up on set and within two seconds it just felt like we had been doing this for years.\"",

      "Edward Norton has previously been nominated for three Oscars \u2013 for playing a homicide defendant in \"Primal Fear,\" a neo-Nazi in \"American History X,\" and a Method actor in \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance).\" For \"A Complete Unknown,\" a biography of Bob Dylan, Norton portrays legendary folk singer Pete Seeger, who became a mentor of Dylan's.",
      "In this early scene, Seeger, having been found guilty of contempt of Congress for refusing to name names in a political witch hunt, responds to the developments with a patriotic song:",
      "Norton told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that playing a music legend like Seeger was both sublime, and terrifying. \"I think every actor, some part of 'em wants to be a rock star, you know?\" he said. \"I think every actor holds the dream in some sense. I mean, I almost started crying at the idea of it, because, well, I was nervous about it. I was nervous about the whole enterprise. Because I thought the idea of a biopic about Dylan \u2013 if you just said it that way, I was, like, Oooh, like, I'm not sure. 'Cause to me, it has a mythical kind of place in me, and I thought, this could be really, really a bad idea.\"",
      "Just one of the challenges: Seeger was an accomplished banjo player, so Norton had to become one as well. \"Yeah, I made the joke that I googled, you know, 'Is there an AI that can replace my hands with Steve Martin's?'\" Norton laughed. \"Or, you know, that thing where you put your arms behind your back and Steve Martin puts his hands under my armpits and does the playing for me? Which I'm not saying is not what happened, you know? It might have. Who knows?\"",
      "In the finished film, his playing looks and sounds authentic, because it is:",
      "He said the film offered him a chance to channel greatness: \"If channeling their frequency gets people refocused on what it looked like when people were using the talents they had to further ideas and values that were bigger than themselves, then that is what makes it worth doing. Can we get people to re-engage with and be moved by and inspired by the idea of artists as agents of change?\"",

      "Guy Pearce, \"The Brutalist\"",
      "In \"The Brutalist,\" architect L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th (best actor nominee Adrien Brody) emigrates from post-war Europe to the United States, where he hopes to revive his career. He gets his chance with a job that tantalizes industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce).",
      "In this scene, Van Buren announces to T\u00f3th that he has decided he wants the architect, an apostle of the Brutalist style of architecture, to design a grand edifice in honor of his mother \u2013 a community center in the hinterlands of Pennsylvania. But Van Buren also hints that he doesn't expect T\u00f3th, or anyone, to deny him his wishes, as Van Buren begins to take ownership over T\u00f3th:",
      "At the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Pearce spoke of the dynamic between his character and that of Brody's: \"The interesting kind of position that Van Buren takes, or tries to take, in life generally is that he is the top dog, that he is the one in control, that he is the one who has the power, that he is the one who decides. And I think a lot of that does come from insecurity, from feeling powerless, from feeling like he's not in control. And he's worked his way to seemingly a position in life where he has the dominance. And yet, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 comes into his life, who he's intuitive enough and has enough taste to recognize not only his skill but also his artistry, etc. But the thing he really detects in L\u00e1szl\u00f3 is, I believe, sort of an underlying sense of self-confidence, an ability to see the truth of the world, where my character is ... whatever truth he's feeling within himself, he's masking, hiding, being presentational, etc.",
      "\"And so, I think the yearning for a man like this, to be a man like this, to perhaps possess a man like this is quite the mirror and quite the turmoil for Van Buren,\" Pearce said.",
      "Pearce described the dualism of his character in \"The Brutalist\" to the Associated Press: \"I'm really aware of how precarious we are as human beings \u2026 Good people can do bad things and bad people can do good things. Moment to moment, we're trying to just get through the day. We're trying to be good. And we can do good things for ourselves and other people, but pretty easily we can be tipped off course.\"",
      "\"There's a performative element to Van Buren,\" he said. \"He exhausts himself because he's trying to dominate, to be the one in charge, be Mr. Charming. I don't think he can ever enter a room without being self-conscious. That's an exhausting way to be, I reckon.\"",
      "Born in England, Pearce moved to Australia and at age 20 starred in the popular soap opera \"Neighbours.\" He shot to international fame starring in \"L.A. Confidential\" and Christopher Nolan's \"Memento.\"\u00a0 And while he appeared in the best picture winners \"The King's Speech\" and \"The Hurt Locker,\" and the \"Alien\" franchise, much of his resume has been in smaller films, such as \"Animal Kingdom,\" \"The Rover,\" and \"Factory Girl\" (playing Andy Warhol). He won an Emmy for the HBO mini-series \"Mildred Pierce.\"",
      "This is Pearce's first Academy Award nomination. His \"Brutalist\" performance also received Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations.",

      "Set in 1970s and '80s New York City, the film (written by journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Ali Abbasi) traces the origins of the real estate tycoon and future reality TV star/U.S. president through his relationship with Cohn, who, it could be said, helped make Trump what he is today.",

    "story": [
      "Two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman, 95, and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog were found dead Wednesday afternoon in their home outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The deaths were found to be \"suspicious enough in nature\" to require a thorough investigation, a search warrant filed in New Mexico says.",
      "In an email to CBS News early Thursday, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office said, \"Foul play is not suspected as a factor in those deaths at this time. However, (the) exact cause of death has not been determined.\"",
      "\"This is an active and ongoing investigation by the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office,\" the statement added.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa had been dead for some time and their bodies were found by deputies in different rooms, according to a search warrant obtained by CBS News. Hackman was found in a mudroom and Arakawa was found in a bathroom next to a space heater, and there was an open prescription bottle and pills on the counter near Arakawa, the warrant said.",
      "Hackman's daughters and granddaughter released a statement Thursday confirming the deaths.",
      "\"He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa,\" Elizabeth, Annie and Leslie Hackman said in the statement. \"We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss.\"",
      "Hackman was a consummate actor renowned for playing complicated figures in such classics as \"The French Connection,\" \"The Conversation\" and \"Unforgiven,\" and who also delighted superhero fans as the comical villain Lex Luthor in three \"Superman\" films.",
      "Hailed as one of the best actors of the era before retiring from the screen in 2004, Hackman moved easily among genres, from heart-wrenching family stories (\"I Never Sang for My Father\"), crime dramas (\"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mississippi Burning\"), thrillers (\"The Conversation,\" \"No Way Out\"), and triumphant tales of sports (\"Hoosiers\") to comedies (\"Get Shorty,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums\").",
      "Rough-hewn and flinty, a movie star without stereotypical movie-star looks, Hackman gave even his humorous roles a slightly sinister, unpredictable edge.",
      "The quality of Hackman's performances and the charisma that the shy ex-Marine would bring to the screen were praised by famed stage director Ulu Grosbard, who'd once hired him for a small role in Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge.\" In a 2004 Vanity Fair profile, Grosbard described the actor as \"a complex guy. Very intelligent. A generosity of spirit. Socially charming. A lot going on in him. A certain sense of being tormented with past ghosts and things. That's part of what he brings to his work.\"",
      "\"Ghosts and things\" were likely evoked in three of Hackman's most heralded performances, in movies that redefined their genres. In William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" (1971), Hackman played \"Popeye\" Doyle, a New York City detective unbound by rules, who constantly crossed the line between law officer and law breaker while tracking down the head of a drug ring. Dangerous and unpredictable, his Doyle was brash, vindictive and colorful, whether it was chasing down a suspect while wearing a Santa Claus costume or recklessly driving a car in pursuit of an assassin through the streets of Brooklyn.",
      "In Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" (1974), he starred as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert whose wiretapping of his subjects leads to increased paranoia about his own safety when he believes he's uncovered evidence of a murder plot; and in Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western \"Unforgiven\" (1992), Hackman played \"Little\" Bill Daggett, the brutal sheriff of a Wyoming town who confronts Eastwood's bounty-hunting gunslinger.",
      "\"There was no finer actor than Gene,\" Eastwood said in a statement following Hackman's death. \"Intense and instinctive. Never a false note. He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.\"",
      "In a 2001 New York Times interview, Hackman noted that his scene in which he brutally beats up a bounty hunter played by Richard Harris was fueled by the disappointment that Harris hadn't remembered working with Hackman on the 1966 film \"Hawaii.\"",
      "\"I just took that disappointment and did this kind of transference,\" Hackman said.",
      "Hackman was less \"method-y\" than some of his peers, though he admitted that the ways in which he would behave on-screen and off as he inhabited a character \u2014 fueled by memories of his dysfunctional family growing up and the slights he faced during his struggling early years \u2014 took their toll. Temper tantrums earned him a nickname: \"Vesuvius.\"",
      "''I don't mean to live my roles,'' he told The Times. ''But sometimes I suppose it's not comfortable to be around me.''",
      "His success as an actor was merely one facet of Hackman's biography. He also raced sports cars, flew planes, deep-sea dived, painted, designed houses, and wrote or co-authored adventure and historical novels \u2014 living a life as varied and challenging as the roles for which he became famous. \"I need the diversity,\" he explained to CBS's \"Sunday Morning\" in 2000.",
      "\"One could say, you know, that I've achieved some manner of success,\" Hackman said. \"But it's like the difference between being a doctor and a lawyer, and being, maybe, a laborer. I feel that, in some ways, my efforts of being an actor are so all-instinctive, and that I haven't really paid my dues in terms of my contribution to the firmament.\"",
      "From character actor to star",
      "A shy and itinerant acting student, Hackman washed out of classes at the Pasadena Playhouse with the worst grades ever. He had several TV credits (including \"Naked City,\" \"The Defenders\" and \"Route 66\") and was featured in several light comedies on Broadway before appearing in the 1964 Warren Beatty film \"Lilith.\" After Hackman co-starred in \"Hawaii,\" \"A Covenant of Death\" and the war film \"First to Fight,\" Beatty hired him to play Buck Barrow, the older brother of bank robber Clyde Barrow, in the 1967 classic \"Bonnie and Clyde.\"",
      "The film, directed by Arthur Penn and produced by Beatty, was a shot across the bow of the studio system in its glamorous and violent dramatization of a pair of Depression Era lovers who robbed banks and killed people. After initially receiving lukewarm reviews over its blend of blood and sardonic humor, \"Bonnie and Clyde\" quickly garnered a reappraisal, spearheading Hollywood's own \"New Wave\" of filmmaking that revolutionized the industry in the late 1960s and '70s.",
      "It earned 10 Oscar nominations, including one for Hackman for best supporting actor.",
      "His film resume grew as a result, to include \"Riot,\" \"The Gypsy Moths,\" \"Downhill Racer,\" \"Marooned,\" and \"I Never Sang for My Father,\" earning Hackman his second Oscar nod for supporting actor, playing the son of a dominating parent (Melvyn Douglas).",
      "\"The French Connection\" would cement Hackman's position as a movie star. The film's brash, documentary-style production perfectly captured Hackman's character, a seething, sadistic NYC cop seeking to bust a ring of heroin smugglers \u2014 like Ahab on the hunt for the white whale.",
      "Although much of the film's heralded chase scene \u2014 in which Doyle, in a car, pursues an assassin who has hijacked an above-ground subway train \u2014\u00a0 featured stunt driver Bill Hickman, Hackman as Doyle did drive for some of it, crashing his car into a wall.",
      "At times during production, Hackman was unsure about his performance and asked to be fired. And then, after the film proved to be a hit, winning five Oscars \u2014 including for best picture, best director and best actor \u2014 he feared that he would be typecast as a determined cop thereafter. Hackman would return to the role in the 1975 sequel, \"French Connection II,\" in which he gave a grueling portrayal of Doyle suffering withdrawal from heroin addiction.",
      "His star power led him to both big-budget studio fare, headlining an all-star cast in the 1972 disaster film \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" and small character dramas such as \"Scarecrow,\" opposite Al Pacino, and \"Zandy's Bride,\" co-starring Liv Ullman. Other 1970s appearances included playing a private eye in the film noir \"Night Moves\"; a horseman competing in a cross-country race in the Western \"Bite the Bullet\"; a rum-runner in the Prohibition Era comedy \"Lucky Lady\" (opposite Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli); a contract killer in the conspiracy thriller \"The Domino Principle\"; and a World War II general in \"A Bridge Too Far.\"",
      "One of his most memorable turns was an unbilled cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein,\" playing a blind hermit who spills hot soup into the lap of Peter Boyle's monster.",
      "Then came \"Superman\" (1978), in which Hackman, as Lex Luthor, faced off against Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel in a scheme that involved nuking the San Andreas Fault, which would make much of California slide into the ocean and turn Luthor's worthless desert land into prime seaside real estate.",
      "Hackman's criminal mastermind was wily, vain, cantankerous, and a bit too sure of himself. He told the BBC in 1986 that playing Luthor was great fun: \"He's kind of a flamboyant character and deranged, and all the things that actors love to play.\"",
      "Still, director Richard Donner had to go to lengths to coax Hackman into taking the job (a $2 million paycheck helped), and when the actor refused to shave off his mustache (let alone shave his head), Donner agreed to shave off his own mustache if Hackman got rid of his. Once the actor put a razor to his upper lip, Donner ripped off his own mustache \u2014\u00a0 a fake.",
      "He continued playing Luthor for the sequel (shot concurrently with the first film), but when Donner was fired by the producers and replaced for the remainder of what would be released as \"Superman II,\" Hackman walked. A body double and dubbed voice filled in for him. He later returned to the role in 1987's \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.\"",
      "\"Getting to be somebody\"",
      "Eugene Alden Hackman was born January 30, 1930 in San Bernadino, California. His father, a pressman for newspapers, moved the family several times during Hackman's youth before they settled in Danville, Illinois. It was there, when Gene was 13, that his father left the family with just a wave goodbye.",
      "Seeking escape from an uneasy family life, Gene was entranced by the movies. He idolized James Cagney and Errol Flynn, and vowed to become an actor himself. \"I loved the idea that somebody could convince me that they were a sea captain without being phony,\" he told Vanity Fair in 2004. \"I think because I was shy I felt insecure, and acting seemed like a way of maybe getting around that. Getting to be somebody.\"",
      "He dropped out of school and lied about his age to get into the Marine Corps, where he spent four and a half years. He got a taste of performing as an announcer on Armed Forces Radio, but injuries from a motorcycle accident led to his departure from the Marines, just in time to avoid fighting in the Korean War.",
      "He tried his hand at acting with classes at the Pasadena Playhouse, where his fellow students voted him (along with classmate Dustin Hoffman) \"Least Likely to Succeed.\" He picked up and moved to New York City, where he existed in a stream of menial jobs as he tried to create a path toward an acting career, aided and abetted by a circle that included Hoffman and Robert Duvall. Married, Hackman even shared his apartment with Hoffman for a time, as they experienced disappointments that would have crushed others.",
      "\"It was more psychological warfare, because I wasn't going to let those f*****s get me down,\" Hackman told Vanity Fair. \"I insisted with myself that I would continue to do whatever it took to get a job. It was like me against them, and in some way, unfortunately, I still feel that way. But I think if you're really interested in acting there is a part of you that relishes the struggle. It's a narcotic in the way that you are trained to do this work and nobody will let you do it, so you're a little bit nuts. You lie to people, you cheat, you do whatever it takes to get an audition, get a job.\"",
      "The rejections, he said, \"create a resolve in you that, no matter what kind of part you're given, you can do anything. Give me the challenge, I can do it. The scarier the better.\"",
      "\"He is incapable of bad work\"",
      "In the 1980s, his marriage with Faye Maltese, with whom he'd had three children, ended in divorce. Uncomfortable with life in Los Angeles, he contemplated retirement, though his desire for acting continued.",
      "His credits included \"All Night Long,\" \"Reds,\" \"Under Fire,\" \"Uncommon Valor,\" \"Twice in a Lifetime\" (a rare romantic role), \"Power,\" \"Hoosiers,\" \"No Way Out,\" \"Split Decisions,\" \"Bat*21,\" \"Another Woman,\" \"Postcards From the Edge,\" \"Narrow Margin\" and \"Class Action.\"",
      "In 1988's \"Mississippi Burning,\" Hackman's FBI agent scrapes against the by-the-book attitude of his colleague (played by Willem Dafoe) as they investigate the kidnapping and death of civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi. Hackman earned his fourth Oscar nomination for his performance.",
      "Alan Parker, the film's director, said of Hackman, \"He is incapable of bad work. Every director has a short list of actors he'd die to work with, and I'll bet Gene's on every one.\"",
      "The '90s gave him further latitude to explore his considerable range, from John Grisham legal thrillers (\"The Firm,\" \"The Chamber,\" \"Runaway Jury\") to westerns (\"Unforgiven,\" \"Geronimo: An American Legend,\" \"The Quick and the Dead,\" \"Wyatt Earp\"). He brought heft and authority to the thrillers \"Crimson Tide,\" \"Extreme Measures,\" \"Absolute Power,\" \"Enemy of the State,\" \"Under Suspicion,\" \"Heist,\" and \"Behind Enemy Lines,\" and winking humanity to the comedies \"The Birdcage,\" \"Heartbreakers,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Welcome to Mooseport,\" his last film appearance.",
      "In 1992, he starred on Broadway in \"Death and the Maiden\" with Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss, under the direction of Mike Nichols.",
      "Hackman the writer",
      "He retired from the screen in 2004 and would only return as narrator on a pair of documentaries about the Marines. He lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his second wife, Betsy Arakawa, and pursued his interests in art and writing.",
      "When he met up with Daniel Lenihan for some scuba lessons, the two got to talking about adventure books they grew up with and decided to try writing one \u2014 a pirate story. Hackman wrote his chapters longhand in spiral notebooks; the two would then meet up at a caf\u00e9 to go over their work. \"I would have some pages, he would have some pages,\" Hackman told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"We would trade. And we'd read them over while we were ordering and eating, and by the end of that couple of hours, we would have critiqued each other's work and decided where we were going to go from there.\"",
      "\"The Wake of the Perdido Star,\" a tale of shipwrecks and piracy set in 1805, was published in 1999. It sold well but received mixed reviews. The acclaimed actor now faced a new audience. He told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The fact that you're being judged on your intelligence and your skill as a writer, and your skill as a storyteller, that was very tense for me \u2014 and being criticized, and finding that you're vulnerable to the critics, in a way that I hadn't experienced before.\"",
      "Hackman and Lenihan later collaborated on the crime drama \"Justice for None\" (2004) and the historical novel \"Escape From Andersonville\" (2008). Hackman then authored two books solo: a Western, \"Payback at Morning Peak,\" and a police thriller, \"Pursuit.\"",
      "His interest in writing may have been inherited from his grandfather, a reporter, and he'd explored that avenue of expression as far back at the 1980s when he'd optioned a crime novel by Thomas Harris that he'd hoped to adapt, direct and star in. But his screenplay grew distressingly overlong and he let the option slide. The book: \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"",
      "Hackman regularly refused interviews in his later years but in 2021, to mark the 50th anniversary of \"The French Connection,\" he shared with the New York Post the revelation that he'd only watched the film once. \"Filmmaking has always been risky \u2014 both physically and emotionally \u2014 but I do choose to consider that film a moment in a checkered career of hits and misses,\" he wrote in an email.",
      "As for the car chase, he added, \"There was a better one filmed a few years earlier with Steve McQueen,\" tipping his hat to the 1968 film \"Bullitt.\"",
      "Maybe. But at the conclusion of \"The French Connection\" chase, Hackman's \"Popeye\" Doyle, like so many of his other characters, refused to let his prey get the better of him.",

      "The world-renowned musician \u2014 a nine-time Grammy Award winner and Pulitzer Prize holder \u2014 was\u00a0given his first trumpet at age 6. He began classical training at just 12 years old. At 22, he became the first musician to win a Grammy in both jazz and classical music in the same year.",
      "But Marsalis doesn't get emotional when reflecting on his many achievements.",
      "\"I don't have a sentimental relationship with myself,\" Marsalis told \"CBS Mornings\" co-anchor Gayle King during an interview at New York City's Lincoln Center.",
      "He doesn't feel proud. He feels grateful.",
      "\"I'm grateful for \u2026 the opportunities that have been provided for me, and the education I received, and all the great musicians I've played with, and play with. And the fantastic people I get to work with. But nothin' I did was about me \u2026 This was about jazz,\" Marsalis said.",
      "\"The house that Wynton built\"",
      "Marsalis is the managing and artistic director of\u00a0Jazz at Lincoln Center\u00a0which recently marked the\u00a020th anniversary\u00a0of the opening of\u00a0Frederick P. Rose Hall\u00a0\u2014 the first complex devoted solely to jazz. Affectionately known as \"the house that Wynton built,\" the 100,000-square-foot facility features carefully curated spaces for performance, education and broadcast.",
      "Inside the concert hall, you can often hear Marsalis and the orchestra rehearsing \u2014 and sharing notes with each other in the process.",
      "\"When we rehearse, we do our thing our way. We talk, we argue about music, we go back and forth with each other, 'cause we have that love and that respect,\" Marsalis explained.",
      "Marsalis cherishes collaboration with fellow musicians as they search for the right sound.",
      "\"When you play your arrangement, if it's not good, the band goes silent. I'll say, 'Y'all don't like that one?'\" Marsalis joked.",
      "While Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center orchestra are thrilled by the organization's milestone achievements, the legendary jazz musician acknowledges the path to creating their own space wasn't always so smooth.",
      "\"It was hard,\" he admitted. \"And we wanted to kill each other at the end of it. It's like learnin' how to play. It's hard. But that's what makes it worth doin'.\"",
      "There were a lot of moving parts as the small organization worked to raise money for the jazz concert hall. As they started their journey to build Frederick P. Rose Hall, the group ran out of funds. Marsalis wasn't sure if the building would ever get finished.",
      "\"At a certain point, [a] gentleman I was talkin' to, I don't remember his name, he said, 'Look, man.' He said, 'I live down the street from John Coltrane's house in Long Island. We're gonna finish this,'\" recalled Marsalis, adding that he'll \"tear up thinkin' about it.\"",
      "Marsalis' jazz roots run deep",
      "Rose Hall, which features three concert and performance spaces, is located in Midtown Manhattan, less than a mile from the famed Juilliard School that Marsalis attended as a teen.",
      "Born in New Orleans to\u00a0renowned jazz pianist and educator Ellis Marsalis Jr., music pulsates through Marsalis' veins. Aside from his father, Marsalis had another role model: John Coltrane.",
      "\"I started listening to 'Trane all that summer when I was 12. I would put that record on. And I started to be able to hear what he was saying. And then when I heard that, I was like, 'Man, it's like a whole world opened up. Like, you have the wisest, most insightful people in the world are talkin' to you,'\" Marsalis recalled when he began his classical training.",
      "Marsalis, now 63, has recorded over 100 studio albums. Over the past five decades, he developed a reputation that preceded his art.",
      "Some have called him \"stuffy\" and \"combative\" and claimed his work was too narrow \u2014 but Marsalis doesn't take any of these critiques personally.",
      "\"I grew up in segregation, OK? And when Martin Luther King was killed, we were integrated into an environment. And many times, what I felt and had to say was not what was being said, OK?\" Marsalis explained.",

      "Cynthia Erivo, \"Wicked\"",
      "\"Wicked,\" the film version of the long-running Broadway musical (which was itself based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel), is a prequel to \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and tells of the friendship and falling-out between Glinda (the most popular student at Shiz University) and Elphaba (an outcast who would go on to become the Wicked Witch of the West).",
      "This tale of frenemies is anchored by best actress Oscar nominee Cynthia Erivo, whose performance echoes the pain of being seen as different (she was born green) and of being targeted by an authoritarian power (which she has dared to stand up to), resulting in her using her new-found power to thwart capture.",
      "In this scene, having decided that she must leave the Emerald City as the nefarious forces of the Wizard close in on her, Elphaba parts ways with Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande), and expresses her wish for freedom, with the song \"Defying Gravity\":",
      "Asked what she brought to the role of Elphaba, Erivo told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"The vulnerability, her humanity.\" She described that vulnerability for herself, personally, as \"always wanting to do well and not wanting to fail, not wanting to let family down. Those are the insecurities. Finally owning how I look.\"",
      "What do you mean?\u00a0 \"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother. It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",
      "Erivo, who won a Tony Award, a Grammy and an Emmy for her role as Celie in the 2015 Broadway revival of \"The Color Purple,\" was previously nominated for two Academy Awards, for best actress and best original song, for the 2019 drama \"Harriet,\" about abolitionist Harriet Tubman.",
      "Erivo's performance as Elphaba is notable not just for her singing, which is astounding, but for singing live on set, rather than acting to pre-recorded vocal tracks. She said it allowed her to play, and change her performance, moment to moment: \"It means that you can act on impulse. \u2026 You have more breath, more space.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" that she did change the character slightly from the original Broadway show (which was originated by Tony-winner Idina Menzel), in order to inform Elphaba with her own experience. \"I definitely felt like I had a responsibility to the character and to the piece because I didn't want to remove it so far away that you just didn't recognize her anymore,\" she said, \"but I also wanted to find out what the truth was for me playing this character. So, I knew it would feel different, but I wasn't trying to make it different. I just knew that if I told my truth, it would end up being different anyway. There's no need to force the difference in. Just happened.\"",

      "The operatic crime film \"Emilia Perez\" leads this year's Oscar nominations, with 13, including best picture, director and screenplay. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the title character, became the first transgender woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for best actress.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n is introduced in the film as Juan \"Manitas\" Del Monte, a Mexican drug lord who kidnaps Rita, an attorney (best supporting actress Oscar nominee Zoe Salda\u00f1a), to hire her for an unusual task: Manitas wants to become a woman. A fake death is staged, Manitas' wife and children are relocated to Europe, and Manitas becomes Emilia P\u00e9rez.",

      "Emilia's desire to reconnect with her wife and children leads to an arrangement whereby Emilia pretends to be a distant relative. Tragedy follows. Written and directed by Jacques Audiard, the film is a highly theatrical musical that earned its four leads (Gasc\u00f3n, Salda\u00f1a, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz) a shared best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "In May, Gasc\u00f3n told the Associated Press, \"I want to get to the point where trans actresses are not limited to only playing trans characters. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't also play a lady going to the bakery. Just because you're trans doesn't mean you can't play a philosopher. Trans people are normal and ordinary just like anyone else. Not every trans person is engaged in prostitution on the street and if they do pursue it's because society rejects them, not necessarily because they wanted to do it. So, the opportunity for me to play these two roles is a gift from the universe. \u2026 It's marvelous to be able to find myself with roles like these.\"",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's Oscar nomination was announced (she was also nominated for a BAFTA, Golden Globe, C\u00e9sar, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards), she received backlash over a series of offensive and racist social media posts she'd made several years earlier. In one, from 2021, she slammed the Academy Awards ceremony as something akin to \"an Afro-Korean festival, a Black Lives Matter demonstration or [International Women's Day].\" Other posts attacked Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, and George Floyd.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n apologized, and deleted the posts. But she was dropped from Netflix's promotional tour for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" was absent from Spain's Goya Awards\u00a0and Britain's BAFTAs, and had a book cancelled. The film's director disavowed her, telling Deadline, \"I haven't spoken to her, and I don't want to.\"",
      "On February 9, at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Selena Gomez commented on the controversy swirling around \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and Gasc\u00f3n's posts: \"Some of the magic has disappeared, but I choose to continue to be proud of what I've done, and I'm just grateful. I live with no regrets,\" she said, adding, \"I would do this movie over and over again if I could.\"",

      "Mikey Madison, \"Anora\"",
      "Sean Baker's \"Anora,\" which won the top prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival, is a sly and at times uproarious comic-drama of a Brooklyn sex worker who enters into a Cinderella romance and marriage with the flighty son of Russian oligarchs. Mikey Madison portrays Anora (preferred name: Ani) as a woman older than her 25 years, but still young enough to believe in the sanctity of elopement, when she and her immature lover, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), decide to tie the knot in Las Vegas.",
      "In this scene, Ani takes a stand about the working conditions at her club \u2013 she will not countenance rudeness from the DJ! (Note: Graphic language):",
      "In this scene, Ivan makes his proposal, to a young woman not quite sure whether to believe the guy (Note: Graphic language):",
      "Madison told Variety that it was a long, engaged process for her to get into the world Ani inhabited: \"It was a character that felt so far away from home in every single way. It was very intimidating at first; how do I empathize with her? I was like, I just need to start small. I did quite a bit of pole training. I did this stripper boot camp where I was taught how to give lap dances, how to twerk. And I would know everything about her \u2014 what cigarettes she smokes, what her school life was like.\"",
      "Madison, whose credits include Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\" \"Scream,\" and the TV series \"Better Things,\" told \"CBS Mornings\" that she \"absolutely fell in love\" with Ani when she read the character. \"She's such a complicated woman. There's so much nuance to who she is. She's so vulnerable on the inside, but she presents herself as this very fierce, tough person. And she has such a fighting spirit, and I was excited to explore all the different parts of what that would be.\"",
      "Baker, whose past films include \"The Florida Project,\" \"Tangerine\" and \"Prince of Broadway,\" told Madison he would write the character of Ani expressly for her if she agreed to be in his movie. \"It's very surreal, and I am very lucky, because I dreamed of working with someone like Sean my entire career as an actress,\" she said.",
      "Madison's accent in particular was key to her getting the character. She moved into the Brighton Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn a month before shooting, in order to absorb the sound of the locals. Luna Sof\u00eda Miranda, who plays Ani's best friend, Lulu, and who is herself a stripper, also instructed Madison on the vernacular of the world of \"gentlemen's clubs.\" \"She is amazing and was so sweet, and made me [two] PowerPoint presentations,\" Madison said. \"One of them was just stripper memes, and then another one was lingo and slang.\"",
      "What was some of the slang? \"Brick.\u00a0Oh, it's brick outside, which means it's cold. And then another one, I think, was a whale, which means a very wealthy, powerful person who comes into the club, someone who has a lot of money.\"",
      "Madison told the Hollywood Reporter that one of the lessons she learned from Baker was, \"He really made it clear that he cared about my ideas and what I was bringing to the film. The most important thing I learned from him is that my opinion and my voice matter.\"",
      "She returned to Brighton Beach since the film was released and found everything to be exactly the same. \"That's one of the things I love about Brighton Beach, is that it's such a time capsule. It's basically been the same for 30 years,\" she told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "This is Madison's first Academy Award nomination. She won the BAFTA, was nominated for Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards, and received best actress honors from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (tying with Marianne Jean-Baptiste for \"Hard Truths\").",

      "Demi Moore, \"The Substance\"",
      "In the darkly comic body horror film \"The Substance,\" Demi Moore plays an aging TV star who discovers a sinister-looking potion that can give her a younger, more perfect version of herself, but at a terrible price.",
      "Moore, who has been a Hollywood fixture \u2013 and a target of the tabloid press \u2013 since the 1980s, told \"Sunday Morning\" that she recognized the story's message about the pains those in the public eye would go through to meet supposed social standards. \"I put so much pressure on myself,\" she said, when discussing the value she had placed on her attractiveness in the past. \"And I did have experiences of being told to lose weight. And all of those, while they may have been embarrassing and humiliating, it's what I did to myself because of that.\"",
      "In this scene, Moore's character, preparing for a date, looks in the mirror, applies makeup, then purposely smears it. She said the process of shooting that scene was difficult. \"Emotionally, that idea that I think many of us have been where we're trying to make something better, and then we just keep making it worse,\" she said. \"For me, it's one of the most heart-wrenching moments in the whole film. And it was at least 15 takes each time. And so, by the end, my face was raw.\"",
      "Asked what she thinks when she looks in a mirror, Moore replied, \"Uhm, it fluctuates. Some days I look and I'm like, Wow. That's pretty good. \u00a0And some days, I catch myself dissecting, hyper-focusing on, you know, things that I don't like.",
      "\"The difference is, now I can catch myself. I can go, Yeah, I don't like that loose skin. But, you know, it is what it is. So, I'm gonna make the best of what is, as opposed to chasing what isn't.\"",
      "Moore endured hours of body prosthetics, and spent much time naked on-screen. She told \"CBS Mornings,\" \"The interesting thing for me was the exploration of that violence we have against ourselves, the harshness of how we can sit in judgment \u2013 that heavily comparing and dissecting. That for me was something that really resonated, because I felt that was so human.\"",
      "She broke out in such films as \"St. Elmo's Fire\" and \"No Small Affair,\" and starred in \"The Seventh Sign,\" \"Ghost,\" \"A Few Good Men,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Striptease,\" \"G.I. Jane,\" and \"Margin Call.\"\u00a0 \"The Substance,\" which marks her first Oscar nomination, won Moore a Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (musical or comedy) and the Screen Actors Guild Award.",
      "\"Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress,\" she said, accepting her Golden Globe. \"And at that time, I made that mean that this wasn't something that I was allowed to have. And so today, I celebrate this as a marker of my wholeness and of the love that is driving me. And for the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong.\"",
      "\"The Substance\" is in theaters and available on Mubi and via VOD.",
      "Fernanda Torres, \"I'm Still Here\"",
      "Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (drama) for her performance as Eunice Paiva, the wife of politician Rubens Paiva, who opposed Brazil's military dictatorship in the 1960s and '70s. In 1971 Rubens was kidnapped by the military, tortured and killed.",
      "The film, directed by Walter Salles (\"Central Station,\" \"The Motorcycle Diaries\"), is based on the 2015 book \"I'm Still Here,\" written by Marcelo Rubens Palva, about his parents. \"[The book is] when we really discovered Eunice,\" Torres told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \"The book is about the son in his adulthood discovering that the real hero of the family was not the father, not him, but it was this amazing woman called Eunice Paiva.\"",
      "It was a story almost lost to history. Following her husband's murder, Eunice \u2013 a housewife and mother of five \u2013 not only fights to protect her children, but also fights to confront a repressive system. She returned to university and became a lawyer, and eventually led efforts to protect the rights of Indigenous people in Brazil and for protection of the Amazon rain forest. But her contributions were never fully acknowledged by the public.",
      "\"It's like a woman who always fights the right fight, and she never had the will to be recognized by this, which is kind of strange nowadays,\" Torres said. \"She was a woman who never felt like it was important for [herself] to be recognized.\"",
      "In this scene, Eunice \u2013 alerted to the death of the family dog in front of their home \u2013 confronts two mysterious men parked across the street, who have been spying on her:",
      "Torres has appeared in more than 60 films and TV productions, including \"Love Me Forever or Never,\" \"The Invisible Woman,\" \"Foreign Land.\" She is the second Brazilian actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. The first? Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, nominated for \"Central Station.\"",
      "Torres told W Magazine, \"I was raised in the wings of theaters. My father, Fernando, is also an actor and producer. And they named me Fernanda. So, I couldn't escape, you see? I paid a lot of hours in shrinks, and I really don't know how I did it, but I did it. I started working as an actress from the time I was 13 years old. \u2026 I find it a miracle. Isn't it a miracle? Even now, to be here with this film. The other day, I saw Judi Dench saying that there is a lot of luck involved in this business, and I think she's right.\"",
      "\"My mother reminded me a lot of Eunice \u2013 the intelligence, a kind of woman that is down-to-earth and courageous,\"\u00a0she told Interview Magazine. \"It's a form of femininity. It has so much to do with my childhood that I think it became universal because of that.",
      "\"It's a tragic story,\" she said. \"In tragedy, you face the unfaceable. You restrain, and you endure. That was very clear, and I never worked in anything like that, where I have restraint and change through the restraint. She was just like a sketch of what she could be, and after the disappearance of the man, she becomes herself, which is a beautiful tale.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here\" has become a sensation in Brazil, where the nation's collective memory about the hundreds who disappeared under the dictatorship, and the 20,000 estimated to have been tortured under military rule across two decades, is being revived through the story of Eunice and her family. But the film also met with universal acclaim outside of Brazil, and earned Torres the Golden Globe for best motion picture actress (drama).",
      "Commenting on the packed category of actresses, Torres talked with \"Entertainment Tonight\" about her \"Cinderella night,\" at the Golden Globes, saying, \"Everybody deserves it. Everybody. So I don't know why they choose this street dog that speaks Portuguese, but I'm so glad!\"",
      "Like Gascon, Torres has been made to address her past, in her case a performance from 2008 in the Brazilian sketch comedy series \"Fantastico,\" in which she appeared in blackface. She told Deadline, \"At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organizations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn't yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil. Thanks to better cultural understanding and important but incomplete achievements in this century, it's very clear now in our country and everywhere that blackface is never acceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm Still Here,\" released by Sony Pictures Classics, is also nominated for best picture and best international feature film.  It is screening exclusively in theaters.",

      "Michelle Trachtenberg, star of the teen drama series \"Gossip Girl\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" has died at 39 years old, the New York Police Department confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday. She was found at her home in Manhattan, and the death is not believed to be suspicious, police said.",
      "The NYPD said officers responded to a 911 call at 8:01 a.m. local time Wednesday to an apartment in midtown Manhattan, where they found the actress unconscious and unresponsive.",
      "\"Criminality is not suspected. The Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death,\" the police statement said, adding that the investigation is ongoing.",
      "Through her representative, Trachtenberg's family confirmed the actress' death and requested privacy for their loss.",

      "Trachtenberg, a child actor who grew up in Brooklyn, appeared in her first commercials at age 3, according to the\u00a0movie database\u00a0IMDb. At 8 years old, she landed a role as Nona Mecklenberg on Nickelodeon's \"The Adventures of Pete & Pete,\" which ran from 1994 to 1996.",

      "Years later, in 2021, Trachtenberg joined other actors from the series accusing prominent show-runner and filmmaker Joss Whedon of\u00a0inappropriate behavior\u00a0when they worked with him on the \"Buffy\" set. Actress Charisma Carpenter, who played Cordelia Chase, was the first person from the show to come forward with allegations.",

      "Adrien Brody, \"The Brutalist\"",
      "In 2003 Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor Oscar-winner in history for his performance in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist,\" as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician struggling to survive in the Jewish ghetto during the Nazi occupation of Poland. It was a role for which he virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning the piano so that he could play Chopin.",
      "Twenty-two years later, Brody is back with his second Oscar nomination for \"The Brutalist,\" Brady Corbet's lacerating tale of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, a Hungarian Jewish architect who emigrates to the United States, and his efforts both to resume his career and to assimilate in a society where antisemitism and classism are rife.",
      "T\u00f3th  is hired by a wealthy Pennsylvania industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete. In this scene, T\u00f3th  \u2013 who is working a construction site in Pennsylvania \u2013 is discovered by Harrison Lee Van Buren (best supporting actor nominee Guy Pearce), who sees in T\u00f3th a talent for which he wants to be the patron.",
      "T\u00f3th  accepts a commission. But once his wife Erzs\u00e9bet (best supporting actress nominee Felicity Jones) arrives from Europe, T\u00f3th\u00a0 feels caught between his artistic impulses and the realities of working in an America that, in many cases, is closed to the foreign born:",
      "Brody, whose mother and grandparents fled Hungary during the 1956 revolution, said their sacrifices informed his performance. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "He also heard the voice of his Hungarian grandfather in T\u00f3th. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said. \"I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "In this extended interview with \"Sunday Morning,\" Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Brody won the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the Golden Globe for best motion picture actor (drama), and the BAFTA for \"The Brutalist.\" The film received 10 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director (Brady Corbet).",
      "\"The Brutalist,\"\u00a0released by A24, is playing in select theaters in\u00a070mm, and is available via VOD.",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \"A Complete Unknown\"",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earned his first best actor Oscar nomination at age 22 for \"Call Me By Your Name,\" as a teenage boy who becomes the target of an older man. In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet plays the iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan during the years when he made a name for himself as a folk artist and as a rock star who, to a segment of his fans, left the roots of folk music behind.",
      "In this scene Dylan is introduced by Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton) for his first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he performs \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Prior to shooting, Chalamet travelled to Minnesota to research Dylan's roots and his formative days. He returned to the state for a screening of the finished film in Minneapolis. In December\u00a0Chalamet told CBS Minnesota station WCCO, \"I think he's very proud of his Minnesota heritage, and I think, in some ways, the way I relate to him is, I think the iron ore in his songs and the iron ore in his voice \u2014 as a New Yorker, as a 28-year-old New Yorker, I don't think my path would have really brought me out here, ever.",
      "\"So, the first time I got here I thought, 'Wow, what a gift, Bob Dylan, being in this guy's worldview.'\"",
      "The actor was first attached to the project in 2019, but shooting was repeatedly delayed due to COVID and then the actors' strike. In the intervening years, Chalamet learned how to play the guitar. \"I don't know if I'll ever get this much time to work on something in advance,\"\u00a0he told The Hollywood Reporter. He also gained 20 pounds prior to shooting, to better match the folk singer's physique.",
      "He said the role marked the furthest that he'd stretched himself. \"And it became so biblical to me in terms of this man's life and his work that I felt if I let my focus err for a second, that I'd be self-loathing about it for years to come. I had three months to play Bob Dylan, and the rest of my life I don't get to be about that, so why not give it my all?\"",
      "To connect with what the reclusive Dylan represented, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he disconnected from his own life for the two-and-a-half months of filming. He did not use his cellphone, or have visitors on set. \"I've never approached a character so intensely as Bob, 'cause I have such respect for the material,\" Chalamet said. \"And I knew I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I remembered that I was lazy on a day when something went wrong.\"",
      "In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, the actor told \"60 Minutes\" he learned to perform about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script. But while Chalamet pre-recorded all the Dylan songs he'd sing in the movie (to be played back on set during filming), he said they sounded \"too clean,\" and so he tried performing live on set, doing so the first time in a scene in which Dylan visits his terminally ill hero, folk artist Woody Guthrie, in a New Jersey hospital.",
      "Director James Mangold said he knew Chalamet nailed \"Song to Woody\" on his first take: \"There's a moment in that scene right at the last stanza where he holds a note \u2013 that would never have happened if we'd used the playback track,\" Mangold said.",
      "Chalamet also examined video of the singer, including footage taken of a Dylan performing a duet of \"It Ain't Me Babe\" with Joan Baez, which he played at a reduced speed. \"That was when I really slowed down, 'cause it's fascinating the way Bob observes her,\" he said. \"And how he refuses eye contact in that video.\"",
      "In \"A Complete Unknown,\" Chalamet and Barbaro perform \"It Ain't Me Babe\":",
      "Speaking of the finished film, Chalamet said, \"I was honored and counting my lucky stars that we got to bring this to life. Because nothing's a given. No opportunity is a given. No career is a given. I talked a lot about this with Edward Norton: the gift to work on something where every day \u2014 whether listening to the musicians we were playing, or the musicians that inspired them, or reading the authors that inspired them \u2014 you learn more about yourself.\"",
      "Chalamet told \"60 Minutes\" he's not sure what he'd say to Dylan if he ever did meet him \u2013 but maybe not even mention the movie, and only talk about the weather: \"What his favorite sandwich is, or something like that ... I would play it super cool, you know? 'Cause I feel like he's probably used to so much hyperbole and praise.\"",
      "Chalamet won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.",

      "At New York's Sing Sing prison, the organization Rehabilitation Through the Arts, or RTA, was formed to produce plays featuring incarcerated men performing classics by Shakespeare, as well as original plays that spoke to the lived experiences of men. \u00a0The value of theater as a tool of reform was made palpable by RTA's success; compared to the prison's typical recidivism rate of 60%, only 3% of former inmates who had taken part in RTA were back in prison three years or less after their release.",
      "Directed by Greg Kwedar, the film \"Sing Sing\" was built on the experiences of real-life former inmates (two of whom, Clarence Maclin and John Divine G Whitfield, share an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay). Colman Domingo was nominated for playing Divine G, a founding member of Sing Sing's theater program and an award-winning author.",
      "In this scene, Divine G attends a clemency hearing and describes to the commissioners how the prison program grew into something he calls \"wonderful\":",
      "Domingo was a journeyman actor whose work in recent years has exploded, from \"Fear the Walking Dead\" and \"Euphoria,\" to \"The Color Purple\" and \"The Madness.\" He received two Tony Award nominations (for acting in the musical \"The Scottsboro Boys\" and producing the play \"Fat Ham\"). He earned his first Oscar nomination last year for playing civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in \"Rustin.\"",
      "He talked about his recent success on \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0last November: \"I feel that it's been a long time in my journey, where suddenly the roles are sort of meeting my skill set and what I'm curious about and what I can do. So, it just feels like I'm a journeyman actor. I've been working for 34 years, and it just feels like, I never knew what this time would be like.\"",
      "Last March, on the day of the Oscars, Domingo posted a picture of himself on Instagram as a child, writing, \"His dream came true. Not easily. With dedication, hard work, hardships, triumphs, pitfalls, detours, reroutes and love and faith. Today is a good day for this kid. He already won. And as you can tell he always loved a pop of color. Got it from his parents.\"",
      "That \"pop of color\" led to Domingo being asked by Anna Wintour to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala. \"She actually said, 'I'm not sure if you'd be interested in something like this or if you have time,'\" Domingo laughed. \"I said, 'I think I have time!'\"",

As Cardinal Thomas Lawrence, Fiennes navigates the intrigue of papal politics, a reluctant player consumed with doubt.",
      "In this scene, Lawrence gives a sermon about the power of uncertainty in faith.",
      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",

      "In \"The Apprentice,\" set in 1970s and '80s New York City, a young Donald Trump, trying to take charge of his father's real estate business, comes under the tutelage of Roy Cohn, a notorious attorney-fixer, who instructs Trump on how to promote himself in the media. Cohn's dictum:\u00a0 Attack, attack, attack. Deny, deny, deny. Never admit defeat \u2026 lessons that Trump would carry through in his business career, social media projections and, later, political branding.",
      "In this scene, Trump (best actor nominee Sebastian Stan) tries to sell himself to a newspaper reporter, using the motivation of Cohn (best supporting actor nominee Jeremy Strong) to not-quite-successful effect. It's clear he has a ways to go\u2026",
      "The film, written by journalist Gabriel Sherman and directed by Ali Abbasi, premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival. While it received critical praise, potential film distributors shied away after the Trump campaign threatened to sue. The movie was ultimately picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment and released shortly before the 2024 presidential election.",
      "In an appearance last October on \"CBS Mornings,\" Stan (whose credits include \"Gossip Girl,\" \"I, Tonya,\" \"Pam & Tommy,\" and playing Bucky Barnes in Marvel's Captain America franchise), admitted that he'd been warned by some to stay away from the project, specifically because it could be seen as a political third rail.",
      "\"Yeah, it's usually when I hear 'Don't do it,' I end up doing it!\" he laughed. \"But generally speaking, I think fear should motivate us to go into the storm, not run away from it.",
      "\"People are going to come into the film with a lot of baggage, a lot of projections [about Trump],\" he said. \"But I think trying to strip away all the noise and getting down to the basics \u2014 what is the emotional need? What is the drive? What was the potential of the man, and where did it end up? How did it all get to this today? And I think there's still value in understanding that.",
      "\"I think the film's about trust,\" said Stan. \"I think we have an opportunity to look at these people and genuinely ask ourselves, do we trust them? Can we use our human instinct rather than what we're being told to think, feel, and understand? Can we use our instinct to trust these people as we're going forward into the future?\"",

    "summary": "Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud in a plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property.",
    "story": [
      "A Missouri woman pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal charge accusing her of concocting a brazen plot to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland mansion and property before a judge halted the mysterious foreclosure sale.",
      "During a hearing in front of a Memphis federal judge, Lisa Jeanine Findley pleaded guilty to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She previously pleaded not guilty to the two-count indictment, which also includes a count of aggravated identity theft that will now be dropped.",
      "When asked by the judge if Findley was admitting guilt and accepting responsibility, she said \"Yes.\" Findley will be sentenced on June 19. She would have faced up to 20 years if convicted, but she is expected to receive less than that under the plea deal.",
      "\"We are grateful for the hard work of the federal investigators and prosecutors who secured this conviction,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. \"Graceland matters so much to so many people around the world \u2013 just go to Memphis during Elvis Week and listen to all the different accents and languages of fans who make the pilgrimage. All of Tennessee is glad that Graceland remains safely in the possession of Elvis's heir and that it will remain a celebrated Memphis landmark for generations to come.\"",
      "Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter Lisa Marie Presley borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan\u00a0before her death in January 2023, prosecutors alleged when she was\u00a0charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.",
      "Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents, and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough sued.",
      "Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.",
      "In May, a public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owes $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.",
      "Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.",
      "Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brings into question \"the authenticity of the signature.\"",
      "The judge halted the foreclosure sale of the beloved Memphis tourist attraction, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.",
      "Elvis bought Graceland in 1957 and died there in 1977, and about five years later, the mansion was opened to the public as a museum and tourist attraction. Hundreds of thousands of tourists visit the 17,552-square-foot mansion each year, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Visitors can then stop at the large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street.",
      "Elvis and other members of the Presley family, including Lisa Marie Presley and her son, Benjamin Keough, who died by suicide in 2020, are buried on the mansion's grounds.",
      "Keough, who starred in the television series hit \"Daisy Jones and The Six,\" said in a 2024 interview\u00a0with CBS News that she plans to continue running the beloved property and keep the mansion in the family. Keough and her husband Ben Smith-Peterson have a\u00a0daughter, Tupelo,\u00a0who is Elvis' first great-grandchild.",
      "\"I think, like, my instinct with everything is always to do what my mother would have wanted. Which is to keep it a home,\" Keough told CBS News last year. \"It was our family's home.\"",

    "story": [
      "Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose intimate vocal and musical style on \"Killing Me Softly with His Song,\" \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\" and other hits made her one of the top recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after, died Monday, her publicist confirmed to CBS News. She was 88.",
      "She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and could no longer sing.",
      "Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star after Clint Eastwood used \"The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face\" as the soundtrack for one of cinema's more memorable and explicit love scenes, between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film \"Play Misty for Me.\" The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack's graceful soprano afloat on a bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972 and received a Grammy for record of the year.",
      "\"The record label wanted to have it re-recorded with a faster tempo, but he said he wanted it exactly as it was,\" Flack told The Associated Press in 2018. \"With the song as a theme song for his movie, it gained a lot of popularity and then took off.\"",
      "In 1973, she matched both achievements with \"Killing Me Softly With His Song,\" becoming the first artist to win consecutive Grammys for best record.",
      "She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that \"her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I've ever known.\" Versatile enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack often favored a more reflective and measured approach.",
      "For Flack's many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new presence in the music world and in the social and civil rights movements of the time, her friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack visited in prison while Davis faced charges \u2014 for which she was acquitted \u2014 for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball's first Black player, and was among the many guest performers on the feminist children's entertainment project created by Marlo Thomas, \"Free to Be ... You and Me.\"",
      "Roberta Cleopatra Flack, the daughter of musicians, was born in Black Mountain, North Carolina, and raised in Arlington, Virginia. A gospel fan as a child, she was so talented a piano player that at age 15 she received a full scholarship to Howard, the historically Black university.",
      "Flack's other hits from the 1970s included the cozy \"Feel Like Makin' Love\" and two duets with her close friend and former Howard University classmate Donny Hathaway, \"Where Is the Love\" and \"The Closer I Get to You\" \u2014 a partnership that ended in tragedy. In 1979, she and Hathaway were working on an album of duets when he suffered a breakdown during recording and later that night fell to his death from his hotel room in Manhattan.",
      "\"We were deeply connected creatively,\" Flack told Vibe in 2022, upon the 50th anniversary of the million-selling \"Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway\" album. \"He could play anything, sing anything. Our musical synergy was unlike (anything) I'd had before or since.\"",
      "She never matched her first run of success, although she did have a hit in the 1980s with the Peabo Bryson duet \"Tonight, I Celebrate My Love\" and in the 1990s with the Maxi Priest duet \"Set the Night to Music.\" In the mid-90s, Flack received new attention after the Fugees recorded a Grammy-winning cover of \"Killing Me Softly,\" which she eventually performed on stage with the hip-hop group.",
      "Overall, she won five Grammys (three for \"Killing Me Softly\"), was nominated eight other times and was given a lifetime achievement Grammy in 2020, with John Legend and Ariana Grande among those praising her.",
      "\"I love that connection to other artists because we understand music, we live music, it's our language,\" Flack told songwriteruniverse.com in 2020. \"Through music we understand what we are thinking and feeling. No matter what challenge life presents, I am at home with my piano, on a stage, with my band, in the studio, listening to music. I can find my way when I hear music.\"",
      "In 2022, Beyonc\u00e9 placed Flack, Franklin and Diana Ross among others in a special pantheon of heroines name-checked in the Grammy-nominated \"Queens Remix\" of \"Break My Soul.\"",
      "Flack was briefly married to Stephen Novosel, an interracial relationship that led to tension with each of their families, and earlier had a son, the singer and keyboardist Bernard Wright. For years, she lived in Manhattan's Dakota apartment building, on the same floor as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who became a close friend and provided liner notes for a Flack album of Beatles covers, \"Let It Be Roberta.\" She also devoted extensive time to the Roberta Flack School of Music, based in New York and attended mostly by students between ages 6 to 14.",
      "Flack had taught music in D.C.-area junior high schools for several years in her 20s, while performing after hours in clubs. She sometimes backed other singers, but her own shows at Washington's renowned Mr. Henry's attracted such celebrity patrons as Burt Bacharach, Ramsey Lewis and Johnny Mathis. The club's owner, Henry Yaffe, converted an apartment directly above into a private studio, the Roberta Flack Room.",
      "\"I wanted to be successful, a serious all-round musician,\" she told The Telegraph in 2015. \"I listened to a lot of Aretha, the Drifters, trying to do some of that myself, playing, teaching.\"",
      "Flack was signed to Atlantic Records and her debut album, \"First Take,\" a blend of gospel, soul, flamenco and jazz, came out in 1969. One track was a love song by the English folk artist Ewan MacColl: \"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\" written in 1957 for his future wife, singer Peggy Seeger. Flack not only knew of the ballad, but used it while working with a glee club during her years as an educator.",
      "\"I was teaching at Banneker Junior High in Washington, D.C. It was part of the city where kids weren't that privileged, but they were privileged enough to have music education. I really wanted them to read music. First, I'd get their attention. (Flack starts singing a Supremes hit) 'Stop, in the name of love.' Then I could teach them!\" she told the Tampa Bay Times in 2012.",
      "\"You have to do all sorts of things when you're dealing with kids in the inner-city,\" she said. \"I knew they'd like the part where ('The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face') goes 'The first time ever I kissed your mouth.' Ooh, 'Kissed your mouth!' Once the kids got past the giggles, we were good.\"",

Tickets are also for sale directly through Fyre Festival Mexico's website, ranging in price from $1,400 to $1.1 million.",

After years of reflection and now thoughtful, the new team and I have amazing plans for Fyre 2. The adventure seekers who trust the vision and take the leap will help make history.\"",
      "For now, it's unclear what exactly festival attendees are getting for their money. The festival's site promises arts, cuisine, music, comedy, fashion, gaming, sports and \"treasures.\" But no musical artists have committed to performing at the three-day event, slated for May 30 to June 2. Instead, so-called \"Fyre Experiences\" will be released in a number of drops leading up to the festival,\" its website says.",
      "Lostnights, a Mexican festival producer, will produce and operate the event.",
      "What does $1 million buy you?",
      "Most ticket holders have to pay for flights and accommodations separately to attend the festival. But with a $25,000 \"Fyre Phoenix\" pass, attendees \"will stay amongst the artists and other performing talent\" at one of two luxury resorts, the event website\u00a0says.",
      "A package valued at roughly $1.1 million, dubbed the \"Prometheus God of Fyre\" pass, covers accommodations for up to eight people, although other perks are not specified. The pass grants access to \"unique adventures, intimate dinners and other exclusive excursions,\" the festival site notes, without providing additional details.",
      "Guests with the highest-priced pass can choose to stay on either a yacht or in a villa, according to the Fyre website, and will travel by private air travel from Miami to Cancun, then by helicopter to Isla Mujeres.",
      "What happened at the first Fyre Festival?",
      "McFarland also promised a luxury experience at the first Fyre fest, staged in Great Exuma, Bahamas, eight years ago, with Blink-182 and other musical acts expected to perform.",
      "Instead, most pass holders found that their accommodations consisted of unfinished tents and drenched mattresses, with cheese sandwiches for sustenance.",
      "McFarland, who was convicted of defrauding investors of more than $27 million, in 2018 was sentenced to six years in prison. He served four years and was released in 2022. His partner in the first festival, rapper Ja Rule, said the following year that he had been \"hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hoodwinked, led astray\" by the organizers.",

      "For the first time in more than 25 years, a new daytime soap opera will debut and it is already making\u00a0history.",
      "\"Beyond the Gates\" focuses on the Dupree family, a prominent Black family living in a gated community outside Washington, D.C. Leading the cast are actors Clifton Davis and Tamara Tunie with Daphn\u00e9e Duplaix and Karla Mosley portraying their daughters.",
      "\"It's fresh, it's innovative, it's exciting,\" Duplaix said during production in December.",

      "Divide 18 strangers into three \"tribes\"; drop them on remote islands with little food and no shelter, and have them outwit and outplay one another until the last competitor standing is crowned the winner of a $1 million prize. When the adventure reality game show \"Survivor\" debuted on CBS in May 2000, nothing like it had been seen on American television before.",
      "Asked to describe the series, \"Survivor\" host and showrunner Jeff Probst said, \"It is a social experiment, in that it takes a group of people who don't know each other, and forces them to rely on each other, while playing this game where you vote each other out.\"",
      "Probst invited \"Sunday Morning\" to watch this experiment for ourselves, in Fiji, as he began taping Season 48, which premieres on CBS and Paramount+ this Wednesday.",
      "Asked if he still gets nervous hosting the series for the 48th time, Probst replied, \"I don't get nervous on 'Survivor.' It's weird. I've never gotten nervous. I lean into it. I love the uncertainty.\"",
      "And it's this uncertainty that's made \"Survivor\" one of the most popular shows on television for a quarter of a century. The show averages around 6 million viewers an episode. In the past 24 years, fans have collectively watched ten-and-a-half billion hours.",
      "\"When I knew 'Survivor' was going to be interesting was the first day of the first season,\" said Probst, \"when we abandoned everybody on the beach, and Richard Hatch \u2013 who ended up winning the first season \u2013 got up in a power position in a tree. And he was looking down on everyone, and he said, 'I think we should all talk!'\u00a0 And Sue Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin, looked up and said, 'Where I'm from, we work while we talk.'\"",
      "While Probst had no doubt, \"Survivor\" almost didn't happen. Mark Burnett, the British TV producer behind hits like \"The Apprentice\" and \"Shark Tank\" (and now President Trump's newly-appointed special envoy to the United Kingdom), re-imagined a Swedish reality series (\"Expedition: Robinson\") and took his idea to just about every U.S. TV network.",
      "\"And every network said, 'No. That's a crazy idea. We don't wanna do it,'\" said Probst. \"But Mark is not easily deterred. So, he went out and got sponsors for the entire show.\"",
      "At the time, Probst hosted music shows on cable TV (including VH1's \"Rock & Roll Jeopardy!\"). \"I was literally the last person hired,\" he said. \"I heard Mark talking about 'Survivor' on a radio interview. And he described the show. I knew when I heard it; I told all my friends, 'This is my show, this is what I've been waiting for.'\"",
      "Today, Probst (now also the showrunner) has his hands in every aspect of production, including combing through more than 15,000 audition tapes that arrive each year. \"I know within 30 seconds, honestly, within 30 seconds, I'm pretty sure you're gonna be on the show or not,\" he said. \"Some people are compelling immediately.\"",
      "People like Stephanie Berger, a technical product manager from New York City, and one of this season's chosen ones. Asked in Fiji what her strategy for the game will be, Berger replied, \"In my, like, day-to-day life, everyone will tell you that I get to be the alpha, like, I like to be in charge. I like control. And I know that I cannot come out here and do that.\"",
      "Kyle Fraser is a contestant from Roanoke, Virginia. \"When I first started watching 'Survivor,' I knew that this game was for me,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Are you willing to lie? Like, where do you draw the line in your game?\"",
      "\"Listen, I am gonna have to lie,\" Fraser said. \"You know, I'm not gonna tell people I'm a lawyer.\"",
      "Contestants not only need to build trust through any means possible; they have to win mental and physical challenges from the moment they arrive, or risk getting voted off.",
      "Probst says what we see is never staged or scripted, including tribal councils, where he grills contestants off-the-cuff, a skill he's developed over time.",
      "I said, \"You're a student of psychology and anthropology.\"",
      "\"Without the degrees!\" Probst laughed. \"I've always loved all of that. I just never formally applied it. I didn't want to be a psychologist; I wanted to be a storyteller.\"",
      "What does make it on television is carefully selected from thousands of hours worth of video shot around the clock for 26 days, in what is one of the largest television productions on Earth. \"It's a great trick, because when you're watching 'Survivor' it does feel intimate, and it is,\" Probst said. \"When the tribes are on the beaches, there's just a small handful of crew there and producers. But when you get to a challenge or tribal council, you know, there's cameras everywhere. We have roughly 400 people that are our international crew. Then we have another 400 Fijians who work with us as well. So, we're close to 1,000 people.\"",
      "Each season films in the summer, with crews arriving months in advance, turning a resort into a production village.",
      "Roberta Limjap, who works in the art department, said, \"It's not only work, it's family.\"",
      "All of the materials, equipment and props are produced here. \"Everything is made from scratch,\" she said. \"You can't buy this.\"",
      "Dozens of young production assistants test every detail of the challenges while crews plot camera angles.",
      "I had my chance. And yes, it's much harder than it looks. And tribal members often compete exhausted and hungry. They are not fed when the cameras are off.",

      "\"It sounds like you're in this until the end?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm in it now,\" Probst replied. \"I don't have any thoughts of not being in it. But I mean, yeah, if you're saying at 86, I mean, maybe I'm too old then! But I never really look at it that way. I feel like I'm a part of a team. And I've said to the people I work with, 'As long as you all keep showing up, I'll keep showin' up.'\"",

      "Gagosian represents more than 100 artists, and shows the works of Picasso, Warhol, and de Kooning. His clients include billionaire mega-collectors like New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, music mogul David Geffen, and cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder. Gagosian said, \"That's why New York is such a great city for an art dealer, because you have all these super-competitive rich guys trying to (you know, in a certain way) outdo each other \u2013 'I got one.' 'Oh, I got one better.'\"",
      "Gagosian, who grew up in an Armenian family in Los Angeles, never had any formal art training. In the 1970s, he was working as a parking attendant. Then he saw somebody selling posters on the street. \"I saw that and I said, 'Jeez, I could do that.' And so, I bought basically the same posters, I literally paid a dollar apiece, and then put a little aluminum frame on them and put 'em on a peg board and tried to get as close to twenty bucks as I could, which is a pretty good profit margin.\"",
      "He built it into a business, and started having shows. In 1981, a young New York artist caught his eye: Jean-Michel Basquiat. Gagosian bought three of his paintings on the spot. \"And sadly, I sold them all. Wish I still owned them!\"",
      "He'd give Basquiat his first West Coast exhibition, which put Gagosian's gallery on the map. \"It was a big deal in L.A.,\" he said. \"We did the show and it was, like, mobbed. The buzz was \u2013 I'd never experienced anything like that in my gallery.\"",
      "But Gagosian knew that New York was the center of the art world, and in 1985, he relocated.",
      "How was he received in the New York art world? \"They didn't like me,\" he said. \"I guess they thought I was gonna, you know, cause some trouble.\"",
      "\"Well, you kinda did!\" I said.",
      "\"I'd rather not go into that litany, but I was roughed up quite a bit by competitors, I think very unfairly.\"",
      "He earned a nickname, \"Gogo,\" which he says actually started when he was young. \"When I was kid, my friends had a hard time pronouncing my name, Gagosian. And that's really where it started. But then it became, people associate it with something else.\"",
      "But Gagosian made an important ally, the esteemed dealer Leo Castelli. On a walk together one day, Castelli stopped a non-descript man in the street: \"And so I said, 'Well, who was that?' 'Oh, that's Si Newhouse.' And I'll never forget his very words: 'He can buy anything.'\"",
      "Newhouse, who owned the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, would become Gagosian's first big client. At Sotheby's 1988 auction of Jasper Johns' painting \"False Start,\" they sat side-by-side: \"He didn't want to be seen bidding,\" said Gagosian. \"So, he would literally nudge me when he wanted to bid. And I bid, I think it was $17 million. And he got the painting.\"",
      "It was a record for a living artist at the time. \"It was, you know, like, jaw-dropping,\" Gagosian said.",
      "But that price seems almost quaint today.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think there's a billion-dollar painting out there?\"",
      "\"Maybe; I don't see why not,\" Gagosian replied. \"A young artist, if he's really talented, can sell for a million dollars.\"",
      "I asked Gagosian about the comments of one of his former rivals, Arne Glimcher of Pace Gallery, who said five years ago, \"This market has nothing to do with art. It's all about how fast one can make money.\"",
      "\"You know, there's a certain truth to what he's saying,\" Gagosian said, \"but I don't think it's just about money at all. I don't think, if people didn't love art, you know, I think they wouldn't buy it at that level. I don't think it's just an asset class. And it's not just about money. It's just gotten more expensive to buy really great art.\"",
      "\"Do you think in any way it distances ordinary people from loving art?\"",
      "\"No. I think it actually makes art seem more interesting. Wow! Somebody spent X amount of money for a painting? Wow, that's fascinating!\"",
      "Gagosian \u2013 who's had some high-profile romances, is single, and has no children \u2013 is still energized by the hustle. \"I guess to a degree I thrive on it,\" he said. \"It gives you something to go for.\"",
      "\"Why do you thrive on it?\"",
      "\"Cause I'm tenacious. And because I like to win.\"",
      "\"What's the win for you?\"",
      "\"The win is to keep it going. The win is to survive at the top. There's no real finish line.\"",
      "But there is, of course. Gagosian turns 80 in April. And the man who GQ magazine called \"The closest thing the art world has to a Caesar,\" still has no plans of succession for his empire.",
      "So, can there be a Gagosian without Gagosian? \"I don't know; that's the question,\" he said. \"I don't want to think it's an impossibility. I think it's a serious challenge. But I'm not ready to pass the reins. I enjoy it too much.\"",
      "I asked, \"Are you ever gonna be, do you think?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Well, it kind of means you're, like, never at rest.\"",
      "\"Well, there's no time to rest, really. It's overrated!\" he laughed.",

The administration has granted some exemptions to the order.",
      "\"FDA, the same as CDC, participated in the vaccine composition consultation that just finished. They contributed again with the data package. So they participated as in the past,\" Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the WHO's global influenza program, told reporters on Friday.",
      "A source familiar with the exemption told CBS News that the FDA is\u00a0able to work with the WHO on \"public health outbreak and emergency response.\"",
      "The Trump administration has granted some waivers for U.S. officials to collaborate on other diseases, like allowing the CDC to work with the WHO on an Ebola outbreak in Uganda.",
      "Zhang's comments about the FDA's participation followed the release of this year's WHO recommendations for how the annual flu shot should be updated for the next flu season in the Northern Hemisphere. Experts and officials gather from around the world every February to come up with the updates.",
      "As part of that process, the FDA runs one of four WHO \"essential regulatory laboratories\" developing tests for the potency of influenza shots.",
      "One major change recommended by the WHO for the next flu season is an update to an ingredient that guards against strains of the virus called H3. Data from the U.S. suggests this season's vaccines were less effective for some kids in protecting against an H3 strain.",
      "\"The H3 component always gives us the most grief. It's constantly changing and evolving quicker than the other viruses,\" said Ian Barr of the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia, part of the WHO's network of influenza researchers and testing laboratories.",
      "WHO officials also said the U.S. had resumed sharing data within the global influenza system, making it available in time for the process of updating flu shots. Some of the sharing was done by publishing data to publicly available data platforms, instead of to WHO servers, as was standard in the past.",

      "\"We're all left trying to understand what is going on. Why was this meeting canceled? It's an important meeting. What's the plan for flu vaccines this year,\" Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA advisory committee and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News.",
      "Offit said he received the notification that the meeting was canceled shortly after 4 p.m. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to discuss how to update the shots for the next flu season, Offit said.",
      "Some of the other committee members said they had not received any notification about the upcoming meeting being canceled. Offit said the email he received was addressed to all of the committee's members.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed Thursday that the meeting had been canceled.",
      "\"The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,\" the spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, said in a statement.",
      "It is possible for the FDA to make the pick for flu shots without consulting the panel, a former federal health official said, though it would be unprecedented in recent history.",
      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "\"Because the vaccine is grown in eggs, for the most part, it requires six months to produce. So March is six months before September, which is when these vaccines roll out,\" said Offit.",
      "Last year, the FDA asked the committee to meet on March 5 to decide on how to update the influenza shots for the 2024 to 2025 season.",
      "The agency usually announces these meeting dates around a month in advance. Next month's meeting had not yet been publicly disclosed.",
      "Which strains are picked to be targeted by the vaccines can have a significant impact on how effective the shots are.",

      "So far this season, the vaccine's protection against flu hospitalization was at least 63% for children and at least 41% for adults. These estimates of effectiveness against hospitalization, released Thursday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, are considered high for flu vaccines.",

Effectiveness was 32% for children and adolescents, from the CDC's U.S. Flu VE network of health care systems. That's down from 67% in last year's estimates.",
      "Those figures are lower than from another network of outpatient providers in the report. The study's authors suspect the decline is because of a difference in how many kids were infected in each by a strain of the flu virus called H3N2.",
      "\"The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients,\" the study's authors wrote.",
      "Earlier data reported by the CDC suggested that this season's flu vaccines might be poorly matched against many H3N2 strains this season. Around half of infections this past fall and winter were H3N2.",
      "Scientists say that the protection offered by flu shots varies widely based on several drivers, not just how well-matched the shots are to what strains are circulating. A major factor is what kind of immunity people have from previous infections and vaccinations.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Arline Geronimus' research shows how societal pressures like institutional racism, classism, financial stressors or the environmental can impact not just the length of life, but also the quality of life for marginalized communities suffering chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Forty years ago, the public was outraged.\u00a0 It seemed there was a wave of teenage girls, particularly Black teenage girls, getting pregnant. \"This was a new idea, this new deviant class of people, and it was portrayed in these terms that were really not accurate: babies having babies,\" said Arline Geronimus.",
      "Geronimus was at the time a graduate student.\u00a0 The prevailing wisdom was that high rates of infant mortality in the Black community were because women were having children when they were too young. \"I had worked in a school for pregnant teens. And none of what I was hearing, and had taken as common sense myself, was what I was seeing,\" she said.",
      "Geronimus looked at the numbers and found that, actually, younger mothers were having more successful pregnancies. She said, \"For the Black women, the lowest risk ages were in the teens and the late teens. And then they went straight up, so that by the 20s, and certainly by the mid-to-late 20s, there was substantially more risk of infant mortality if you had a baby, compared to if you were 18 or 19. And by 35, things were off the charts.\"",
      "How did people react to what she found? \"Not very well!\" Geronimus said. \"People thought I was promoting teen childbearing. The papers wrote columns where they called it things like, 'Research Queen Says Let Them Have Babies.'\u00a0 I got death threats.\"",
      "Geronimus became a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where she teaches to this day. She lowered her profile, but also widened her perspective, examining indicators like the lower life expectancy of Black Americans (72.8 years) compared to white Americans (77.5).",
      "She developed a theory: that stress caused by racism and other societal pressures contributes to poor health. She named it \"Weathering.\"",
      "\"The idea of weathering was connoting sort of how a rock, for example, would be weathered by hundreds of years of rain and wind,\" she said. \"It's gonna affect it [and] absolutely wear it down. I like the word weathering in particular, because it also has another meaning, which is that you weather the storm.\"",
      "The weathering theory deals with not just length of life, but quality of life. For example, while on average Black women outlive white men (76.5 years versus 75.1), Geronimus found that Black women faced shorter active life expectancies (59 years) than white men (64) \u2013 that is, Black women become disabled at earlier ages.",
      "After decades of working on the theory, she pulled it all together in a book called, \"Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society\" (Little, Brown Spark).\u00a0 She defines weathering as the way that structural racism makes life very hard. But there are a lot of different factors. \"This is not something that just affects people of color; it can be a class issue as well?\" I asked.",
      "Geronimus said, \"It can be a class issue, it can be a stigmatized group issue; anybody who's human is capable of becoming weathered, and will become weathered to some degree, if they're also oppressed or marginalized or suffering endless stressors, whether it's environmental or material hardships or hunger, or whether it's the fact that you're not affirmed or valued, and you have to question where you belong, and what it's safe to do or say in different situations.\"",
      "Dr. Kimberlydawn Wisdom has spent much of her career putting Geronimus' theories into practice, trying to overcome the impacts of weathering: \"She endured a lot for this work. And we just have to applaud her. Her courage is remarkable.\"",
      "Wisdom is the senior vice president of community health and equity at Henry Ford Health in Detroit. She also served as Michigan's first surgeon general.",
      "She notes how day-to-day stress actually changes the body down to the cellular level, leading to premature aging. \"The body keeps score,\" she said. \"So, take diabetes, take hypertension, take cardiovascular disease, infant mortality, maternal mortality \u2013 just multiply the poor outcome by two or by three, and that's what you see in the populations of color. So, it's like the Caucasian population can catch a cold, but populations of color actually develop pneumonia.\"",
      "For example, the latest studies show infant mortality rates for Black Americans that are more than double those of white Americans (10.9 versus 4.52).",
      "To take on the challenge, Dr. Wisdom founded the WIN Network, which stands for the Women-Inspired Neighborhood Network. Expectant mothers are given health care, guidance and support through pregnancy and beyond, which has led to maternal and infant deaths falling, and birthweights rising.",
      "Courtney Anderson said the experience of having her third child, Kalani, through WIN was great. \"She's a happy baby. Most happiest baby I got,\" Anderson said.",
      "Anderson had her first child, Kamrine, before she was in the WIN Network. He was followed a year later by his brother, Kristian. \"With my first child \u2026 I had my hands full, kind of stressed. Kind of bummed out. Post-partum depression.\" But she says the support she received through WIN was a major improvement, increasing her happiness, which in turn has impacted her children positively. \"It's going to affect them really well to know that their mom's happy,\" Anderson said. \"When mom is happy, they get it, and they have a lot more.\"",
      "I asked Wisdom, \"What would you say to people who would kind of maybe blow this off and say, 'Everybody has stress, everybody has things to deal with, what's the big deal? Take care of it yourself. Be responsible for your own health'?\"",
      "\"Yes, people should eat healthy, have healthy behaviors, but yet we see the weathering, when we look through the lens of what's really happening in a society,\" Wisdom replied. \"You can do all those things and have a poor outcome. See, the typical narrative is you eat healthy, you go to school, you get a college degree, you have a good life and you live to 80 or 90.\u00a0 That happens with one population. When you find another population that eats healthy, goes to college, gets an education, gets her Ph.D., and dies of maternal mortality, something is wrong.\"",
      "When asked if the concept of \"weathering\" could be seen as another way of making Black people into victims, or building in another stereotype, Geronimus said, \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. Even if you go back to slavery, no one was working harder, or doing more. But the people who pronounce on 'Black people's poverty is self-inflicted 'cause they're too lazy or too irresponsible,' they're just wrong.\"",
      "At the end of the day, it got me thinking about my own family.\u00a0 My parents died in their 70s. Two siblings died in their early 60s \u2026 all of them much too soon.\u00a0 There were certain ailments \u2013 diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure \u2013 that were expected almost, or that just kind of comes with the territory. And Wisdom says it shouldn't come with the territory \u2013 or that the reason it came with the territory was due to weathering.",
      "Wisdom said, \"Many people of color, families say that, 'Oh, we all get diabetes. We all get cancer. I mean, that's part of the natural course of life. That's the life course.' That is not the life course.\"",

      "The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure,\u00a0rose\u00a02.5% in January on an annual basis, matching economists' expectations and providing some reassurance on the heels of hotter-than-expected inflation data earlier this month.",
      "The PCE index and other inflation yardsticks, such as the Consumer Price Index, measure the change in prices over time of a typical basket of goods and services.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The January numbers match forecasts that the PCE rose 2.5% on an annual basis, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "While inflation has plunged from its recent peak of about 9% in June 2022, it still remains higher than the Fed's goal of driving it to an annual rate of 2%. Today's PCE data follows on the heels of the most recent CPI report, which showed that inflation accelerated in January to 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The PCE report shows that inflation \"rose at a mild pace in January, which offers some relief after a string of economic reports suggesting that inflation is heating up again,\" said Key Wealth managing director of fixed income investments Rajeev Sharma in an email.",
      "The recent sticky CPI report had reinforced the Fed's decision in January to\u00a0pause\u00a0on additional rate cuts, but today's data suggests that the central bank could still introduce more reductions this year. That said, \"thoughts of multiple rate cuts for 2025 may be overly optimistic based on today's data,\" Sharma added.",
      "Many consumers are also expressing their concerns about stubborn inflation, with a large majority of Americans telling CBS News polling that their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation. Some are expressing concern about their ability to save or buy extras, the poll found.",
      "Consumer sentiment is souring amid stubborn inflation and other headwinds, according to some recent measures. \"The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for Democratic-leaning consumers plunged to the lowest since the economic collapse of 2008 in February,\" noted Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:41:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",

    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",
      "Skype will be available until May 5, giving users about two months to decide which option they want to take.",

    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

      "The FAA has faced a longstanding shortage of air traffic controllers, while the agency's oversight of the skies has recently faced heightened scrutiny following a\u00a0string of recent aviation incidents. Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday announced an effort to \"supercharge\" the hiring of air traffic controllers following a visit to an FAA training institute in Oklahoma, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "\"I witnessed firsthand the dedication, skill and rigor that our future air traffic controllers bring to their training and the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.\"",
      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",
      "Duffy has said he wants to extend a waiver to the current controllers who are near retirement age to help expand the workfroce.",
      "Earlier this month, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing air traffic controllers, told CBS the proposal is not \"an effective solution to addressing the chronic air traffic controller staffing crisis. \"In the next 12 months, we anticipate 49 ATCs across 35 facilities will reach age 56.\u00a0This is not enough to address the nationwide staffing shortage,\" the union added.",
      "\"The solution to the ATC staffing crisis is a long-term commitment to hiring and training and the retention of the experience of all the highly skilled, highly trained air traffic controllers,\" it added.",

    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",
      "Does the gold card need congressional approval?",
      "Congress determines qualifications for citizenship, but Mr. Trump said gold cards would not require congressional approval.",
      "\"We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It's totally legal to do,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication \u2014 it's a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in, meaning companies will pay for people to get in and to have long, long term status in the country.\"",

    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service could be part of the Federal Aviation Administration's plan to upgrade the nation's aging air traffic control systems.",
      "Starlink's internet equipment is being tested in least two different FAA facilities.\u00a0Starlink is also preparing to take over a $2 billion contract currently held by telecom provider Verizon, the Associated Press\u00a0reported.",
      "Starlink, which is owned by Musk's SpaceX, provides satellite internet access for residential and business customers. It bills itself as the most \"advanced internet system,\" providing access to users in remote locations. The FAA does not currently rely on Starlink to power its air traffic control system, which monitors more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers per day.",
      "Musk this week criticized the FAA's air traffic control network, writing on X that the \"Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\"",
      "Verizon spokesperson Kevin Israel told CBS News that the technology Musk is referring to are the legacy systems run by defense contractor company L3Harris, not by Verizon.",
      "\"Our company is working on building the next generation system for the FAA which will support the agency's mission for safe and secure air travel,\" he said. \"We are at the beginning of a multiyear contract to replace antiquated, legacy systems. Our teams have been working with the FAA's technology teams and our solution stands ready to be deployed. We continue to partner with the FAA on achieving its modernization objectives.\"",
      "Musk on Thursday acknowledged his mistake in criticizing Verizon. \"Correction: the ancient system that is rapidly declining in capability was made L3Harris. The new system that is not yet operational is from Verizon,\" he said Thursday afternoon on X.",
      "L3Harris didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Broad overhaul",
      "The Department of Transportation is reviewing a range of federal contracts, including with Verizon, as the agency moves to overhaul the air traffic control infrastructure used to direct flights around the U.S.",
      "A source familiar with the matter said it's not clear if Starlink can meet the needs specified in the FAA's contract with Verizon. But the satellite telecom provider could be one of several technologies under consideration as part of a broad overhaul of the nation's air control system.",
      "On Monday, the FAA\u00a0said\u00a0on X that it \"has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska.\" The agency also said it is testing one Starlink terminal at the FAA's facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and at two terminals at \"non-safety critical sites\" in Alaska.",
      "Bloomberg News\u00a0reported on Monday that Musk last week approved 4,000 Starlink terminals to be shipped to the FAA for testing, citing a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The FAA told CBS News that \"no decisions have been made\" about a long-term contract to upgrade its air traffic control systems.",
      "Representatives for Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Potential conflict",
      "Lawmakers and experts on government contracts have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest for Musk, who is spearheading the Trump administration's effort to slash federal funding even as companies like SpaceX do business with the government.",
      "Asked by CBS News whether Musk's involvement could pose a conflict of interest given that the FAA regulates SpaceX and his companies are a major user of the airspace, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month that the entrepreneur isn't involved in setting agency policy.",
      "\"I was very conscious of anyone who comes in \u2014 I don't want to see conflicts of interest,\" Duffy said on Feb. 19 from the FAA's ATC Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia. \"So [Musk] was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, but looked at the terminals that they use... They had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't work well.\"",
      "\"[T]hey spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about how do controllers do their job,\" Duffy added.",
      "Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University Law School, noted that federal regulations prohibit government contractors from having conflicts of interest, and warn even against the mere appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on reducing government corruption, told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's close relationship with President Trump could amount to a conflict of interest.",
      "\"You do worry if there is pressure from the top, even from the president himself, to favor his system over the existing system,\" Amey said. \"People could be afraid to lose their jobs and will do whatever they can to please Elon Musk.\"",
      "Such contracting decisions should be made \"by career civil servants doing what is in the best interest of taxpayers,\" he added.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers said the FAA moving to adopt Starlink's technology raises potential ethical concerns.",
      "\"How much richer will Elon get with an FAA contract to another one of his companies? My ELON MUSK Act would stop this blatant corruption,\" Rep. Mark Pocan, a Democrat from Wisconsin, wrote on X on Tuesday, referring to proposed legislation that would direct federal agencies to end any contracts held by a special government employee, similar to bans that apply to members of Congress and other federal employees.",

      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted 14 to 9 on Thursday to advance Chavez-DeRemer's nomination for a vote in the full Senate. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to vote against her nomination, while three Democrats \u2014 Sens. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia \u2014 voted in favor. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska did not originally cast a vote, but the committee later allowed her to record herself as a \"yes.\"",
      "Paul said he would oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress, which did not advance past introduction. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize. During her confirmation hearing last week, the former lawmaker addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect\" and she backs right-to-work laws, which allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",
      "Without Paul, Chavez-DeRemer needed at least one Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee to vote to advance her nomination. Republicans have a 12-11 vote majority on the panel.",
      "Hassan of New Hampshire said in a statement this week that she would support Mr. Trump's nominee, all but ensuring that Chavez-DeRemer had the votes needed to advance, barring any surprise opposition from other Republican committee members.",
      "\"Though we may not agree on everything, after meeting with Representative Chavez-DeRemer and listening to her testimony during her confirmation hearing, I believe that she is qualified to serve as the next Secretary of Labor and I look forward to working with her to support New Hampshire's workers and small businesses,\" Hassan said in a statement.",
      "Hickenlooper told CBS News on Tuesday that he was also considering supporting Chavez-DeRemer's nomination. The Colorado Democrat cited Chavez-DeRemer's support for youth apprenticeships, an issue he has worked on for nearly a decade, as a positive. And though he called her shifting stance on the PRO Act \"a little disconcerting,\" he acknowledged that she is \"serving at the will of the president.\"",

      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it was immediately beginning to pay retroactive benefits and will increase monthly payments starting in April to the more than 3.2 million people affected by a law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, who said it would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "How much will Social Security payments increase?",
      "Depending on the type of benefit and pension, the change in payment amount will vary from person to person. \"Some people's benefits will increase very little, while others may be eligible for over $1,000 more each month,\" the Social Security Administration stated.",
      "As Social Security benefits are paid a month behind, most of the affected beneficiaries will start receiving their updated payments in April for their March benefit, the agency noted.",
      "The benefits hike under the law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "\"Social Security's aggressive schedule to start issuing retroactive payments in February and increase monthly benefit payments beginning in April supports President Trump's priority to implement the Social Security Fairness Act as quickly as possible,\" Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a statement.",
      "SSA in late January cautioned that those impacted might have to wait up to a year or longer to reap the benefits of the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, which\u00a0became law on January 5, 2025. At the time, the agency noted that the legislation had not provided additional financing or staff to help implement the law or deal with the increased workload.",
      "\"The agency's original estimate of taking a year or more now will only apply to complex cases that cannot be processed by automation,\" Dudek added.",
      "Most eligible Social Security recipients will get their one-time retroactive payment by the end of March, which will be deposited into their bank account on record with the Social Security Administration.",
      "The agency is asking beneficiaries to wait until April to ask about the status of their retroactive payment.",
      "To learn more about the expanded Social Security benefits, including who is eligible and when recipients will see an increase in their payments, visit the Social Security Fairness Act website.",
      "The push to enhance Social Security payments for public pension recipients has been in the works for decades, with the Senate holding its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The Senior Citizens League said it was pleased that the timeline for implementing the new law had been moved up, given the high cost of living that affects so many of its members, according to Shannon Benton, executive director of the group.",
      "Still, the advocacy group is concerned that the law's passage could speed up the depletion of the Social Security trust fund.",
      "\"Addressing the pending shortfall through comprehensive Social Security reform should happen sooner rather than later,\" Benton told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The new law had bipartisan support but faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law would add an estimated\u00a0$195 billion\u00a0to the federal deficit over a decade.",

      "As far as the menu changes go, while a small share of customers might miss the beverages that are being eliminated, Starbucks probably \"did the math and figured the cost of keeping them on the menu was greater than the benefits,\" Cohan said.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Sales data show many Europeans, seemingly angry with Elon Musk as he navigates his close relationship with President Trump to influence U.S. policy, may be choosing to steer clear of Tesla vehicles. A sharp decline in sales comes as anti-Musk ads appear in the U.K. and other countries alluding a comparison to Adolf Hitler.",
      "Tesla new vehicle sales fell across the continent by nearly half in January, plunging by 45% year-on-year, according to data compiled by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). In hard numbers, Tesla sold just under 9,950 vehicles in Europe in January. For the same month in 2024, the company sold just over 18,100 new vehicles.",
      "The drop in sales has hurt Tesla's share price, which had nearly doubled in the first month after Mr. Trump's election victory to a record high. Most of those gains have since been lost, and Tesla's market cap has plunged below the $1 trillion mark. The stock, which as of early Wednesday traded for roughly $305 in the U.S., remains up 54% over the last 12 months, buoyed by the company's ambitious plans for self-driving cars and humanoid robots.",
      "In Germany, Tesla sales fell nearly 60% in January year-on-year as would-be buyers voted with their wallets \u2014 possibly angered by Musk's purported meddling in the country's federal elections last weekend, which saw the far-right AfD party he backed become the country's second most popular.",
      "In France, Tesla's sales in January fell 63%. The plunge came after Musk backed far-right parties in that country and attacked left-leaning ones, although the impact of his political activities on Tesla's financial performance is hard to gauge and could reflect other factors, such as mounting competition from other EV makers.",
      "Tesla sales in the U.S. have also been declining, falling 1% in 2024 compared to the prior year \u2014 the automaker's first annual sales decline in 12 years despite global EV sales rising 7.3%. As CBS News' MoneyWatch reported this week, Wall Street analysts have said Musk's political activities could alienate consumers previously loyal to the brand, and protests have erupted at a number of Tesla dealerships in the U.S.",
      "\"Musk's DOGE related actions and more powerful alliance with Trump clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand,\" analysts for the U.S. financial services firm Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday company report on the automaker. \"There is some momentum around this effort in Europe and pockets of the U.S. as well since November. That said, we view this as containable brand issues for Tesla for now that are not a major cause for concern.\"",
      "A similar trend has been seen in Europe. While Tesla's European sales numbers plunged in January, ACEA data show sales of electric vehicles overall surged by 34%, with buyers increasingly eyeing options from China and the continent's own automakers.",
      "In the U.K., after Musk attacked Prime Minister Keir Starmer and called for the release of a jailed far-right activist, January sales fell a comparatively gentler 12% year-on-year, but anger at Musk has been visible on British roadsides after an activist group called \"Everybody Hates Elon\" pasted over bus stop ads with posters showing Musk making a hand gesture that strongly resembled a Nazi salute at one of Mr. Trump's inauguration events.",
      "Musk has neither admitted nor denied his intent with the gesture, but he mocked the criticism of it, saying in a message on his social media platform X that, \"the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"",

      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",

      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" analysts with High-Frequency Economics said in report. \"The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election might not be a coincidence,\" they added.",
      "Growing pessimism",
      "Consumers' view of current conditions tumbled 3.4 points to a reading of 136.5 this month and views on current labor market conditions fell again.",
      "\"Views of current labor market conditions weakened,\" the group said Tuesday. \"Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Feb 2025 10:22:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is apparently nearing a deal with Ukraine that could grant the U.S. access to mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Exactly three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and under pressure from President Trump, a senior Ukrainian official said negotiations over a deal that would give Washington access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves were \"in the final stages.\"",
      "Ukraine's leaders have voiced hope that such an agreement might serve as the foundation of a long-term security guarantee for the country against any future Russian aggression, but the Trump administration has thus far remained non-committal, framing access to the resources as a way for Ukraine to pay the U.S. back for its support over the last three years.",
      "\"The negotiations have been very constructive, with nearly all key details finalized,\" Olga Stefanishka, Ukraine's Vice President for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, said in a Monday\u00a0social media post, written in English. \"We are committed to completing this swiftly to proceed with its signature. We hope both US and UA leaders might sign and endorse it in Washington the soonest to showcase our commitment for decades to come.\"",
      "Often called Europe's \"breadbasket\" thanks to its massive agriculture sector, Ukraine is also one of the continent's most resource-rich nations. Much of Ukraine's mineral reserves remain untapped, however, due to difficult access, old and undeveloped infrastructure and a lack of investment \u2014 all exacerbated by Russia's ongoing offensive military campaign, which initially started in 2014 with its invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula.",
      "Zelenskyy says he'd give up presidency in exchange for peace, NATO membership",

      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control. The occupied territory includes a significant portion of Ukraine's mineral reserves, including highly sought-after rare earth elements used in defense, aerospace, technology and energy production.",
      "The ground beneath Ukraine is believed to hold about 5% of the world's total reserves of rare earth elements. The U.S., which covers about 12 times as much ground, is estimated to have only 1-2% of the world's rare earths, by comparison.",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, about half of Ukraine's rare earth element reserves lie in territory currently occupied by Russia.",
      "Ukraine also has one of Europe's biggest reserves of titanium. The strong, lightweight metal is a vital component in modern aircraft, missiles and countless other civilian and military hardware, from satellites to bicycles. Ukraine's reserves are largely found in the northwest and central regions of the country, which have remained firmly under Kyiv's control.",
      "Lithium deposits, meanwhile, are scattered across Ukraine's central, east and southeast regions \u2014 the latter of which are currently held largely by Russia. Lithium is a key component in the rechargeable batteries found in everything from electric vehicles to laptops and smartphones.",
      "Ukraine also holds about 20% of the world's global reserves of graphite. Commonly used in pencils, the soft substance is also used in industrial lubricants for motors and other machinery.",
      "\"We must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference at the White House on Monday with visiting French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "\"I think this discussion (a potential mineral deal) is a very important one,\" said Macron. \"First, because it's important for the U.S. and it will be a good occasion for a first very important meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy. Second, I think it's \u2014 there is a lot of economic upside on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has characterized U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals as a way for the country to pay back Washington for the military assistance provided over the past three years.",
      "U.S. industry currently relies largely on China, which is the world's biggest source of rare earths and other minerals, for its raw materials. An increase in the supply of those materials from Ukraine could eventually mean a decrease in minerals purchased from China \u2014 and less concern from a national security standpoint.",
      "While the details of the deal said to be taking shape have not been shared, Zelenskyy earlier refused to sign an agreement that reportedly would have given the U.S. access to about $500 billion worth of his nation's mineral wealth \u2014 about half of its estimated future value.",
      "\"I won't sign a document that 10 generations of Ukrainians will pay for,\" Zelenskyy said over the weekend. He has stressed that any agreement to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's minerals must come with security guarantees\u2014\u00a0 including, he suggested Tuesday, the possibility of American forces deploying to protect American investments.",
      "Zelenkyy's chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, said Monday that Kyiv was considering investment opportunities with both the U.S and European countries, \"which includes minerals, their development and extraction,\" calling his country's natural resources \"a very important element that can work in the general structure of security guarantees \u2014 military guarantees and others.\"",

    "story": [
      "European allies were quick to stand up for Ukraine after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance openly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a sharply contentious Oval Office meeting Friday.",
      "Zelenskyy and his Ukrainian team were told to leave the White House earlier than planned Friday and an important minerals agreement went unsigned, a White House official said, after a heated exchange in which Mr. Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being insufficiently grateful for U.S. support. The president told Zelenskyy he's \"gambling with World War III\" and did not acknowledge Russia's role in its assault on Ukraine.",
      "Russia immediately praised the president and vice president's admonishments of Zelenskyy. After the televised showdown, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chair of Russia's security council, backed Mr. Trump on X: \"The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,\" the Russian official said of Zelenskyy. \"And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is 'gambling with WWIII.'\"",
      "European allies leapt to defend Ukraine, and Zelenskyy reshared on X over 20 of their social media posts and thanked them.",
      "\"Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,\" wrote Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council. \"Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You will never be alone, dear President @ZelenskyyUa.\"",
      "\"There is an aggressor: Russia,\" French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on X, in a translated post. \"There is a people under attack: Ukraine. We were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago and to continue to do so.\"",
      "\"Luxembourg stands with Ukraine,\" wrote Luc Frieden, prime minister of Luxembourg.",
      "Thank you for your support. https://t.co/8miNebF718",
      "Congressional Republicans have mostly fallen in line behind Mr. Trump, denouncing Zelenskyy's demeanor in the Oval Office meeting, while others have remained silent.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has been supportive of Ukraine, condemned Zelenskyy. Graham said he spoke with the Ukrainian leader Friday morning and warned him \"don't take the bait.\"",
      "\"I don't know if we could ever do business with Zelenskyy again,\" Graham told reporters outside the White on Friday. \"He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Michael Baumgartner of Washington, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, echoed the call for Zelenskyy to resign \"for the good of his country.\"",
      "\"Whatever your view on what happened in today's bizarre televised WH diplomatic meeting, the West needs US and Ukrainian leadership trust on confronting Russia. After today, that likely requires a new Ukrainian leader,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, however, defended Ukraine.",
      "\"A bad day for America's foreign policy. Ukraine wants independence, free markets and rule of law. It wants to be part of the West,\" he told CBS News. \"Russia hates us and our Western values. We should be clear that we stand for freedom.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, a staunch Ukraine ally who serves as co-chair of the House Ukraine Caucus, said the meeting was \"heartbreaking\" to watch.",
      "\"It is time to put understandable emotions aside and come back to the negotiation table. This can and will be fixed,\" he said in a statement. \"I am confident that the parties will reconvene in pursuit of a mutually agreeable solution that best serves the interests of the United States of America and Ukraine. This is the only acceptable outcome.\"",
      "Republican senators who have been supportive of Ukraine and not shy against disagreeing with Mr. Trump have yet to share their opinions, including Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "The House or Senate were not in session Friday, making it more likely that lawmakers will be asked about the meeting in their districts or states over the weekend or when they return to the Capitol on Monday.",
      "Democrats in Congress widely criticized Mr. Trump, calling him \"a useful idiot for Putin\" and \"an embarrassment.\"",
      "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was among the bipartisan group of senators who\u00a0talked with Zelenskyy\u00a0just before his White House visit and posted a hopeful picture before the fateful White House meeting.",

      "\"And our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own & stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of Europe,\" she added. \"Shame on you.\"",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Mr. Trump had thrown \"a temper tantrum in the Oval Office.\"",
      "\"This is just the latest in a string of alarming gestures made by Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin \u2014 excluding Ukraine and our allies from negotiations, refusing to hold Russia accountable for its invasion, parroting Kremlin propaganda, attempting to extort Ukraine at gunpoint, and siding with Russia at the UN. It's a dangerous pattern of deference to a dictator who seeks to undermine democracy worldwide,\" Meeks said.",

      "Afterward, the Ukrainians left the Oval Office to head to a \"separated room,\" while the U.S. team stayed in the Oval Office, a White House official said. While the Ukrainians were waiting in the other room, national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them to leave. The official said Zelenskyy was trying to smooth things over and asked for a reset, but Mr. Trump and other administration officials were offended by Zelenskyy's behavior.",
      "The contentious meeting exposed severe rifts between the U.S. and Ukraine, upending the planned signing of a rare minerals deal between the two countries as Mr. Trump pressures Ukraine to agree to end the war that Russia began. During the course of the meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"",
      "Later in the day, high level administration sources confirmed to CBS that there have been discussions about whether U.S. will keep sending military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy.",
      "The meeting veered into tense exchanges after Vance said during the course of the meeting that the world has reached this point in part because of the Biden administration's actions, and said it was time for diplomacy.",
      "Zelenskyy challenged Vance on this point, noting there had been other ceasefire agreements Russian President Vladimir Putin had broken \u2014 and not just during the Obama administration. During Mr. Trump's administration\u00a0Putin violated\u00a0the Minsk ceasefire agreements, which\u00a0had been signed\u00a0by both Russia and Ukraine. And Zelenskyy pointed out that he had signed an agreement with Putin over the exchange of prisoners, \"but he didn't do it.\"",
      "\"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about,\" Zelenskyy asked Vance.",
      "Vance retorted that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to try to \"litigate\" his case in front of the American media.",
      "\"You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,\" Vance told Zelenskyy.",
      "Zelenskyy asked Vance if he'd ever been to Ukraine.",
      "Vance said he's watched videos of what's happened in Ukraine, accusing Zelenskyy of bringing people on a \"propaganda tour\" when they visit Ukraine.",
      "\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" Vance asked.",
      "Zelenskyy, noting that for now, the U.S. is separated from the fighting by an ocean, said of the war, \"You don't feel it now, but you'll feel it in the future.\"",
      "\"You don't know that,\" Mr. Trump argued. \"You don't know that. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're gonna feel, because you're in no position to dictate that. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good.\"",
      "\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said, as Zelenskyy continued to interject and disagree. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. \"You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"",
      "\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you,'\" Vance said.",
      "Zelenskyy kept a measured tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.",
      "\"Please,\" Zelenskyy said. \"You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war\u2014\"",
      "Mr. Trump cut off Zelenskyy and said his country is in \"big trouble\" but \"you have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of us.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said his country has stayed strong from the beginning of the war, and Ukrainians are thankful.",
      "\"It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,\" Mr. Trump said, as Vance again chided Zelenskyy about saying \"thank you.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said it's \"good\" for the American people to see what's going on.",
      "\"You have to be thankful,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You don't have the cards. You're buried there, people are dying, you're running low on soldiers.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine wants the war to end but must have security assurances along with any sort of ceasefire agreement.",
      "Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?",
      "\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay?\"",
      "Earlier in their meeting, before it grew heated, Zelenskyy said negotiations can't only entail talk of a ceasefire, as Mr. Trump pushes for a ceasefire agreement without security assurances included.",
      "\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.",
      "\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"",
      "The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"",
      "\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.",
      "After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0@POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.",
      "As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.",
      "\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"",
      "Administration sources on next steps",
      "High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.",
      "When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.",
      "No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.",
      "The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.",
      "What to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit",
      "Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.",
      "\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\"\u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.",
      "\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.",
      "\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.",
      "Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.",
      "Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"",
      "The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.",
      "\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"",
      "But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.",
      "\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.",
      "\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.",

    "summary": "The move supercharges RFK Jr.'s authority to implement health policy changes.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended a longstanding transparency rule on Friday, supercharging his authority to change policies in areas ranging from Medicaid to the National Institutes of Health without advance notice to the public.",
      "Dubbed the \"Richardson Waiver\" after the former health secretary who issued the rule in 1971, the policy Kennedy repealed had required regulations related to property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts to go through the federal \"rulemaking\" process.",
      "The law governing rulemaking usually exempts such regulations, but in response to calls at the time to close the exemption, officials voluntarily waived it. This meant that, until now, they would go through the process of notifying the public of their proposals and asking for comments before imposing changes.",
      "\"The extra-statutory obligations of the Richardson Waiver impose costs on the Department and the public, are contrary to the efficient operation of the Department, and impede the Department's flexibility to adapt quickly to legal and policy mandates,\" Kennedy said in a filing announcing the end of the waiver.",
      "Now health agencies no longer need to go through the notice and comment process for many policy changes about grants and benefits. This includes new rules that could otherwise be stymied by backlash during a public comment period, like potentially adding in work requirements to Medicaid or redrawing how the National Institutes of Health funds research.",
      "\"It's hugely important, because getting rid of the Richardson Waiver means that the agency can move a lot faster to implement big new policy changes,\" said Samuel Bagenstos, professor of law at the University of Michigan.",
      "Bagenstos previously worked as the general counsel for HHS under the Biden administration. He said following the policy was a major hurdle, bogging down proposals that might have otherwise been finalized.",
      "\"Courts have held HHS to that waiver, so it's not just something they could ignore,\" he said. \"If you think about HHS, it's a $1.7 trillion department. The overwhelming majority of what it does is grants and benefits.\"",
      "The waiver was also cited earlier this month by state attorneys general as one argument in their legal challenge seeking to block the National Institutes of Health's controversial cuts to research funding. They quoted the first Trump administration supporting the waiver in a 2020 post by the department to the Federal Register.",
      "\"The Department believes that its decision-making ought to be as transparent as appropriate to better enable the citizenry to comment on its proposed rules and demonstration projects,\" Trump HHS officials had said.",
      "The Council on Governmental Relations, a group that represents research universities and other institutions, criticized Kennedy's decision Friday. The group's president, Matt Owens, told CBS News in a statement that it \"flies in the face of the Trump Administration's professed mandate for greater transparency.\"",
      "\"For decades HHS policies affecting public health and research institutions have benefitted from public stakeholder participation in the policy process. Public input is an essential element of the policy process that reflects our nation's democratic principles,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy's reversal does not end public comment for all changes tied to benefits overseen by the department. A separate law requires changes to Medicare coverage to go through public comment.",
      "Bagenstos predicted that Friday's attempt to end the waiver would also be challenged, though he acknowledged Kennedy had the authority to seek to end it.",
      "\"I think even the repeal will be challenged. I don't think their announcement of it is the end of the story,\" he said.",

      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",

      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 16:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Iowa's governor signed legislation removing gender identity protections on Friday from the state's civil rights code, despite large, intense protests.",
    "story": [
      "Des Moines, Iowa \u2014\u00a0 Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation to remove gender identity protections from the state's civil rights code on Friday.",
      "In a statement released by her office after the bill was signed, Reynolds \u2013 a Republican and first woman to hold the governor's office in Iowa \u2014 said the Civil Rights Code blurred the biological line between the sexes and forced Iowa taxpayers to pay for gender reassignment surgeries.",
      "She said it was \"unacceptable to me, and it is unacceptable to most Iowans,\" saying the bill simply brings the state in line with the federal Civil Rights Code.",
      "\"We all agree that every Iowan, without exception, deserves respect and dignity. We are all children of God, and no law changes that,\" Reynolds said in the statement.",
      "\"What this bill does accomplish is to strengthen protections for women and girls, and I believe that is the right thing to do.\"",
      "Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state's civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state's civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \"shall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\"",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \"Trans rights are human rights\" and chanting slogans including \"No hate in our state!\"",
      "There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \"Shame!\" as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and fiercely defended it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens what he called \"commonsense\" laws to ban transgender participation in sports\u00a0and access to bathrooms.",
      "\"The legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\" Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers' actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state's hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa's current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state's Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\"",
      "\"The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\" Wichtendahl said. \"The sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\"",
      "When she finished speaking, she got a standing ovation from many legislators and onlookers in the gallery, reports CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI-TV.",
      "The station said that after the Senate passed the bill, a man started yelling from the gallery, calling lawmakers \"fascists\" and asking \"Who's next?\" Three state troopers carried him out. Others who were yelling were also removed.",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa's Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Trump.",
      "He also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women's sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",
      "On Thursday night, Mr. Trump wrote on his Truth Social site: \"Iowa, a beautiful State that I have won BIG every time, has a Bill to remove Radical Gender Ideology from their Laws. Iowa should follow the lead of my Executive Order, saying there are only two genders, and pass this Bill \u2014 AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. Thank you Iowa!\"",

    "summary": "Some 880 employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were laid off on Thursday, a congressional source told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of staffers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, were laid off Thursday as the Trump administration and its newly-created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, continue slashing the federal workforce.",
      "A congressional source told CBS News the layoffs affected 880 NOAA employees. An administration official told CBS News about 5% of the agency's staff was let go, and individuals deemed critical to NOAA's responsibilities, such as National Weather Service meteorologists, were largely spared. A source at the National Weather Service disputed this, however, telling CBS News some meteorologists were impacted, including radar specialists, as\u00a0well as staff\u00a0of the Hurricane Hunters crew, which fly airplanes into storms to help forecasters make accurate predications during a hurricane.",
      "Laid off staffers who were considered probationary employees received an email Thursday, which read in part, \"OPM has advised that '[p]robationary periods are an essential tool for agencies to assess employee performance and manage staffing levels.' (4) In light of that guidance, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and/or skills do not fit the Agency's current needs.\"",
      "Some 400 employees at the National Weather Service were in a probationary period, a NWS source told CBS News, but it's not clear how many of them were included in the layoffs.",
      "Tom DiLiberto, who until Thursday had worked as a climate and weather scientist and public affairs specialist, told CBS News he started as a contractor for NOAA back in 2010, but became a federal employee less than two years ago. His probationary period was set to end on March 13, 2025, two weeks from the day he was terminated.",
      "\"You're seeing the whittling away of scientists, and the people who got fired today are some of the best people you can imagine,\" DiLiberto said. \"These people have dedicated their lives to help others. There's no politics in this. When we forecast, or think of the oceans and keep them clean, we're not thinking about the politics. This is an insult on science and all that's good.\"",
      "DiLiberto had been a forecaster for El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a and, as a public affairs specialist in the office of communications, said he wrote for the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation blog for a decade. He published his final blog for the service the same day he was let go. He said he has been given no information on any next steps or if he would be receiving severance.",
      "Congressional Democrats had been worried DOGE and billionaire Elon Musk, who is classified as a \"special government employee,\" had their eyes set on NOAA for deep cuts. Former NOAA officials told CBS News earlier this month that current employees had been told to expect budget cuts of 30% and a 50% reduction in staff.",
      "Prior to Thursday's cuts, NOAA had about 12,000 staffers across the world, including 6,773 who are scientists and engineers, according to the agency's website.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington State Democrat who chairs the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard, which oversees NOAA, said the job cuts \"jeopardize our ability to forecast and respond to extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods\u2014putting communities in harm's way. They also threaten our maritime commerce and endanger 1.7 million jobs that depend on commercial, recreational and tribal fisheries, including thousands in the State of Washington. This action is a direct hit to our economy, because NOAA's specialized workforce provides products and services that support more than a third of the nation's GDP.\"",
      "House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman, a Democrat who represents California's 2nd Congressional District, called Thursday's cuts a \"betrayal of the American people.\"",
      "\"Musk and his fake officials, the DOGE tech bros, have been rummaging through our most sensitive data without authority in violation of the law for weeks now,\" Huffman said in a statement. \"And this has come with sweeping, indiscriminate layoffs of nonpartisan public servants. Park rangers, firefighters, scientists \u2013 all of these people, whose purpose is to serve everyday Americans, have had the rug pulled out from under them. And we will all be worse off for it.\"",
      "\"Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt,\" Huffman continued. \"People nationwide depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives.\"",
      "Congressional aides previously told CBS News that lawmakers had received multiple complaints about DOGE staff coming into NOAA offices earlier this month.",
      "Former NOAA officials, who spoke directly with current staffers, also previously confirmed to CBS News they saw members of the DOGE team at NOAA headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, and the Hoover Building, in Washington, D.C., where NOAA's parent agency, the U.S. Commerce Department is located.",
      "The NOAA runs the National Weather Service, which issues vital weather warnings \u2014 such as hurricane and tornado warnings \u2014 and the National Marine Fisheries Service. It is also responsible for monitoring the health of the oceans and the warming of the climate.",
      "House Science Committee ranking member Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat who represents California's 18th congressional district, said in a statement, \"This will cost American lives.\"",
      "\"Protect lives and property; that is NOAA's mission,\" Lofgren said. \"Firing the employees that allow the agency to carry out that mission will bring about dire consequences. People will die and face great hardship thanks to the recklessness of Co-Presidents Trump and Musk.\"",
      "Dr. Juan Declet-Barreto, senior social scientist for climate vulnerability in the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, also criticized the cuts, saying Thursday in a statement, \"NOAA's data and science are used routinely by weather forecasters, mariners, farmers, emergency responders, businesses and everyday people across the country. Everyone in the United States relies on NOAA in their daily lives whether they realize it or not, something that will come into focus for many in the weeks and months ahead.\"",
      "President Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs to lead the agency. Jacobs, who was acting director of the NOAA for a time during Mr. Trump's first term, was reprimanded for ethics violations after Mr. Trump held up a hurricane forecast map with black marker appearing to extend the storm's potential path into Alabama \u2014 an incident that became known as \"Sharpie-gate.\"",

      "This time, the email is expected to come from individual federal agencies, not the Office of Personnel Management, as was the case with the\u00a0email circulated to the federal workforce last week. That government-wide directive caused confusion as to whether a response was required \u2014 and the possible ramifications of not answering.",
      "With this round of emails, OPM advised agencies to send the messages themselves, and each department has the discretion to decide to whether to do so, sources told CBS News. The emails are part of a strategy to have agencies account for their employees' work each week and report it back to the government's human resources agency, though no decision has been made about whether the messages will go out weekly, the sources said.",
      "In addition to the individual agencies deciding whether to send the emails, each will decide how long their workforces have to respond and the consequences of not replying, CBS News has learned.",
      "Since returning to the White House, President Trump has made reducing the size of the federal government a key part of his second-term agenda. He tasked Elon Musk to lead the cost-cutting effort through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, though the billionaire is not the administrator of the task force. The White House confirmed earlier this week that Amy Gleason, who worked at the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE, is its acting administrator.",
      "But Musk and his team have roiled the federal government with their initiative; as thousands of probationary federal workers were fired, DOGE employees have sought access to departments' data systems housing sensitive information and work at some independent agencies has ground to a halt.",
      "Their actions have sparked numerous lawsuits, and on Thursday, a federal judge in California found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.",
      "The initial round of emails sent to the federal workforce last Saturday came from OPM with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" It directed recipients to reply with five examples of what they accomplished in the prior week and include their bosses in the response. Government employees had until 11:59 p.m. Monday to answer and were told not to \"send any classified information, links, or attachments.\"",
      "Musk had initially warned on social media that a failure to respond \"will be taken as a resignation,\" but several agencies, including the FBI and Departments of State, Homeland Security and Defense, told their employees to ignore the request. OPM then told human resources officials from departments Monday that it was up to each agency to decide how they would handle the emails to their workers.",
      "But a memo also sent Monday to agency leaders that sought to provide guidance on the government-wide \"what did you do last week\" email said responses should be directed to department leadership, with a copy going to OPM.",
      "It said \"agencies should review responses and evaluate nonresponses.\" The memo did not mention the directions given by department heads that instructed their workforce not to reply.",
      "Roughly 1 million federal workers responded to the first \"what did you do last week\" email. Mr. Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that those who didn't reply \"are on the bubble\" and said his administration wasn't \"thrilled\" about the non-responses.",

      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Africa Command on Tuesday, but has not received a reply. On Friday, Hegseth confirmed the reporting\u00a0in a post on X, sharing CBS News' story with the message, \"Correct.\"",
      "American military airstrikes fall into two broad categories \u2014 deliberate and defensive, according to U.S. Africa Command's website. Deliberate strikes adhere to a multi-layered process of regulations and high-level vetting, which under the Biden administration ran through the Joint Staff and the executive branch.",
      "Throughout the deliberate strike process, military lawyers review the compiled intelligence to determine if individuals are legal combatants under the law of armed conflict, to reduce the risk of civilian casualties and avoid targeted killings of innocent people mistaken for terrorist suspects.",
      "Defensive airstrikes are used \"in limited circumstances where U.S. or specifically designated partner forces are in imminent danger from hostile forces,\" according to U.S. Africa Commands website. These types of airstrikes are typically authorized by the combatant command, and the executive branch does not need to approve these strikes.",
      "A leaked classified study from 2013, obtained by The Intercept, details how the U.S. government authorized drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia between 2011 and 2012 following presidential approval during the Obama administration \u2014 policies similarly implemented under Biden.",
      "Before launching a strike, military commanders had to ensure it met a number of strict criteria and obtain approvals from seven decision makers \u2014 including the president.\u00a0 The individual targeted had to be confirmed as a member of an approved terrorist organization using two independent forms of intelligence. Civilian casualties had to be projected as minimal. And there could be no \"contradictory intelligence\" muddying the waters.",
      "The process became a high-stakes roundtable. The task force that assembled the target package, the combatant commander, the CIA chief of mission, and the host nation all had to sign off on the airstrike. A single dissent along the way meant the operation would be halted.",
      "It's not clear if these same provisions are included in the new directive. However, they did exist during Mr. Trump's first term, with some exceptions on approval by the host nation in countries such as Afghanistan.",
      "The directive to U.S. Africa Command comes at a tumultuous time inside the Pentagon, following the firings by the Trump administration of the top judge advocate generals for the Air Force, Army and Navy. Traditionally seen as apolitical positions, these top uniformed Pentagon officials encompass a broad range of responsibilities, from overseeing criminal cases involving the rank-and-file to ensuring the top brass adhere to international laws of armed conflict.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, Hegseth defended the removals, stating that they were necessary to ensure there were no \"roadblocks to orders given by a commander-in-chief.\"",
      "He added, \"Ultimately, I want the best possible lawyers in each service to provide the best possible recommendations, no matter what, to lawful orders and are given, and we didn't think those particular positions were well suited, and so we're looking for the best.\"",

    "summary": "Refugee aid groups say the Trump administration seems to be trying to circumvent a court ruling blocking his efforts to suspend the nation's refugee admissions program.",
    "story": [
      "Seattle \u2014 Refugee aid groups said in a federal court filing Thursday that President Trump's administration appears to be trying to circumvent a ruling this week that blocked his efforts to suspend the nation's refugee admissions program.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead, in Seattle, had determined Tuesday that while the president has broad authority over who comes into the country, he can't nullify the law passed by Congress establishing the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Whitehead, a 2023 appointee of former President Joe Biden, said Mr. Trump's actions amounted to an \"effective nullification of congressional will\" and from the bench, he granted the aid groups' request for a preliminary injunction blocking Mr. Trump's executive order suspending the refugee resettlement program. Whitehead promised a written ruling in the next few days.",
      "But Wednesday aid groups, including Church World Service and the Jewish refugee resettlement organization HIAS, received notifications that their \"cooperative agreements\" with the State Department had been canceled.",
      "The groups on Thursday asked Whitehead for an emergency hearing to discuss the impact of the termination notices, or to make clear that his ruling also applies to those newly issued notices. The groups called the administration's actions a \"flagrant attempt\" to evade the court's ruling.",
      "\"Defendants are continuing to implement their defunding of the USRAP, and an emergency hearing is necessary to ensure that Defendants are not permitted to evade this Court's bench ruling and the forthcoming written order with antics designed to confuse the state of play,\" the motion said.",
      "Whitehead set a hearing for Monday.",
      "The State Department acknowledged receipt of an email from The Associated Press about the plaintiffs' motion, but did not otherwise respond to questions about it. The notices indicated the cooperative agreements with the resettlement agencies were being terminated \"for the convenience of the U.S. Government pursuant to a directive from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for alignment with Agency priorities and national interest.\"",
      "The refugee program, created by Congress in 1980, is a form of legal migration to the U.S. for people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution - a process that often takes years and involves significant vetting. It's different from asylum, through which people who have just arrived in the U.S. can seek permission to remain because they fear persecution in their home country.",
      "Despite longstanding support from both parties for accepting refugees, the program has become politicized in recent years. Mr. Trump also temporarily halted it during his first term, and then dramatically decreased the number of refugees who could enter the U.S. each year.",
      "There are 600,000 people being processed to come to the U.S. as refugees around the world, according to the administration.",
      "Mr. Trump's order and the administration's subsequent withholding of funds stranded refugees who had already been approved to come to the U.S., forced the refugee aid groups to lay off staff and cut off short-term assistance, such as rent, for those who had recently resettled here, the organizations said in the lawsuit challenging the actions.",
      "Thursday's filing came the day after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block another court order requiring it to release billions in suspended foreign aid. The administration also outlined plans to cancel more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for International Development's foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall U.S. assistance around the world.",
      "Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition supporting Afghan resettlement efforts, said the termination of the contracts would hurt Afghans who worked closely with the U.S. during its more than two-decade-long war in Afghanistan and are now at risk. They've been resettling in the U.S. via the refugee program as well as the special immigrant visa program.",
      "While the special immigrant visa program is still operational, the contract terminations strip away funding that went to helping those who qualified to come to America and start new lives here.",
      "\"Now Afghans are on their own to get here,\" he said.",
      "\"Make no mistake about it \u2014 this is a betrayal on par with what we all felt in August of 2021,\" he said, referring to the chaotic American withdrawal from Kabul under the Biden administration.",

      "A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful, granting some temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration's massive trimming of the federal workforce.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including at the Department of Defense.",
      "\"OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe,\" to hire or fire any employees but its own, he said.",
      "Alsup handed down the order on a temporary restraining order sought by labor unions and nonprofits in a lawsuit filed by the coalition filed last week.",
      "The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the administration's efforts to vastly shrink the federal workforce, which Trump has called bloated and sloppy. Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired and his administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service protection.",
      "The plaintiffs say the Office of Personnel Management had no authority to terminate the jobs of probationary workers who generally have less than a year on the job. They also say the firings were predicated on a lie of poor performance by the workers.",
      "Lawyers for the government say the Office of Personnel Management did not direct the firings, but asked agencies to review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for continued employment. They also say that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired.",
      "There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers \u2014 generally employees who have less than a year on the job \u2014 across federal agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services ranging from fire prevention to veterans' care, the complaint says.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of AFSCME, one of the unions involved in the lawsuit, said in a statement, \"We know this decision is just a first step, but it gives federal employees a respite. While they work to protect public health and safety, federal workers have faced constant harassment from unelected billionaires and anti-union extremists whose only goal is to give themselves massive tax breaks at the expense of working people. We will continue to move this case forward with our partners until federal workers are protected against these baseless terminations.\"",
      "Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges in similar lawsuits attempting to stop the Trump administration's goal of vastly reducing the federal workforce.",
      "Alsup, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, has presided over many high-profile cases and is known for his blunt talk. He oversaw the criminal probation of Pacific Gas & Electric and has called the nation's largest utility a \" continuing menace to California.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is offering financial incentives ranging from $15,000 to $25,000 to employees who choose to voluntarily resign from the federal agency, ahead of what they warn will be \"significant workforce reductions.\"",
      "A message sent out to employees Thursday stated that the agency will soon implement restructuring that includes workforce cuts and \"massive reorganizations.\"",
      "The SSA said that wholesale \"abolishment of organizations and positions\" could happen, as well as reassignments and staff cuts.",
      "Earlier this week, the Office of Personnel Management advised agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" by March 13 and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "Thursday's message offers all Social Security employees three options ahead of the agency's expected cuts: voluntary reassignment \"to a mission critical position,\" voluntary early retirement, if eligible, or \"voluntary separation incentive payments,\" if eligible.",
      "Those who would take the voluntary separation incentive payment must opt in by March 14 and leave the agency no later than April 19. The option echoes the \"fork in the road\" or deferred resignation program from OPM, in which eligible federal employees could resign from their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The incentive payments offered the SSA is dependent on an employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. Those with a GS-8 or under would get $15,000, while those classified with GS-9 to GS-12 would receive $20,000. Those with a GS-13 or higher would receive $25,000.",
      "SSA notes that employees who opt in may be put on administrative leave through April 19 and must not have already opted into the buyout program offered by OPM earlier this year.",
      "Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS News they fear employees may opt in to get the separation payment, and that it could already strain the benefits agency she said is in need of more investment to shorten wait times and open more field offices, not cuts.",
      "\"If people don't take it, then they're going to be constantly looking over their shoulder, looking through their email waiting to see if they get fired,\" Altman said. \"It's going to add stress, chaos and uncertainty.\"",
      "Altman added that employees should first see if their severance pay from a potential termination could be more than what the SSA is offering for voluntarily resigning.",
      "Jill Hornick, a 33-year Social Security employee, noted that public-facing employees who work in field offices and handle claims at Social Security's 1-800 number were told by former acting SSA Commissioner Michelle King that they were exempt from OPM's buyout offer.",
      "\"[King] knew it would hurt public service\" if these hires were allowed to take the offer, said Hornick, who is also an administrative director at an Illinois local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, which nationally represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers. \"Because we're at a 25-year staffing low.\"",
      "Now that this separation incentive is available to them, Hornick said she has \"no doubt\" these frontline employees will take it, and warned that processing times for claims could \"go through the roof.\"",
      "\"I have been trying to reassure [these] employees to take a deep breath. They're terrified, scared to death they will not have a job tomorrow, and put a roof over their head. It's just been one thing after another this week,\" Hornick added.",
      "The incentive payments offer does not apply to probationary employees, who generally have less than a year on the job, and must have worked in the executive branch for at least three years.",
      "Those looking to retire early must opt in between March 1 and Dec. 31. To be eligible for early retirement, an employee must be at least 50 years old and have 20 years of \"creditable service,\" or have 25 years of creditable service at any age.",
      "The SSA has seen several changes in recent weeks. Acting SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek was appointed to the role after the previous commissioner, King, was resistant to allowing staff with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, get access to sensitive agency data.",

      "A State Department spokesperson said a review of its contracts and grants was geared toward eliminating all but the ones that make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",

      "\"We had to go through the Russian hoax together, that was not a good thing,\" Mr. Trump said, adding he's known Putin for a long time.",
      "Mr. Trump said they'll see if there are parts of Ukraine taken by Russia that could be given back to Ukraine, although he didn't specify where.",

      "\"Taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy,\" he said, at once taking a gentle jab at Musk while also attempting to appeal to Mr. Trump's passion for a slimmed down government. \"We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth, and we're open for business, open for investment, and we're determined to help U.S. innovators thrive in the United Kingdom.\"",
      "Starmer presented the president with a letter from King Charles, and Mr. Trump read it in real time. Mr. Trump called the British king a \"beautiful man and a wonderful man.\"",
      "Britain, the U.S., and collective security via NATO",
      "Starmer didn't arrive in Washington empty-handed. He flew in on the wings of an announcement just days earlier that his government was planning to bump U.K. defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, which his office has billed as Britain's biggest sustained defense spending increase since the Cold War. Starmer has left open the possibility of that defense spending rising further, to 3%, after the next U.K. general election.",
      "The timing of the prime minister's announcement was notable, coming just two days before his meeting with Mr. Trump. A White House official said ahead of the meeting that the Trump administration was \"very pleased\" with Starmer's announcement, but that it still wants to see America's NATO allies increase defense spending further, towards 5% of their respective national GDPs. That would be more, proportionally, than even the U.S. spends on defense, which in 2023 amounted to roughly 3.4% of the United States' GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump has implied that the U.S. could break from the historic collective defense agreement of NATO, known as Article 5, which essentially says that if any member is attacked it will be treated as an attack on all, if other member countries do not boost their defense spending.",
      "\"I think that that means there's got to be security guarantees,\" said Starmer, acknowledging the pressure for higher spending, but also indicating that he will ask the White House to provide clear commitments to help defend Ukraine against any future Russian attack if a ceasefire is reached to halt the ongoing war. \"I've indicated that we will play our full part. There has to be U.S. backing, because otherwise I don't think it will deter Putin. We are working on that. I'm having extensive discussions about it.\"",
      "A White House official said the U.S. appreciated Starmer's willingness to consider sending British troops to help with peacekeeping efforts to enforce a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has made it clear that any and all security guarantees for Ukraine may have to come from Europe.",
      "\"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond, very much,\" Mr. Trump said this week. \"We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about, Europe is their nextdoor neighbor, but we're going to make sure everything goes well.\"",
      "U.S.-British trade",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff threats were also the agenda during Thursday's White House meeting. A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. is set to kick in on March 12, ordered by Mr. Trump, he said, to protect American companies. Starmer may seek an exemption.",
      "Mr. Trump implied weeks ago that a unilateral trade agreement could be worked with the U.K. If that does not happen, there's concern that some of the estimated 40,000 British jobs directly linked to steel and aluminum production could be lost and entire plants could close.",
      "After Starmer's meeting with Mr. Trump, he's scheduled to meet back in London with several European leaders on Sunday, including the heads of state from Germany, Italy and Poland. Starmer will no doubt brief them on his talks with the U.S. president.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may join them, after he meets with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday, where he's expected to sign a financial deal to share his country's mineral wealth with Washington, which Mr. Trump has called \"payback\" for U.S. aid to Ukraine over the past three years.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:16:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's speculation about dead or fictitious employees comes after numerous federal workers were told to ignore an email asking them to justify their jobs. Previous government reviews found no evidence of widespread payroll fraud.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk suggested Wednesday that a number of federal employees who did not respond to an email requesting a summary of their achievements from the previous week could be \"dead\" or \"not real people,\" but offered no facts to back it up.",
      "\"We think there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead, which is probably why they can't respond, and \u2014 and some people who are not real people,\" Musk said.",
      "President Trump echoed Musk's claims moments later to reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting.",
      "\"Maybe we're paying people that don't exist,\" he said.",
      "There is no evidence that the federal payroll includes scores of dead or non-existent people. The White House declined to provide evidence for the claim to CBS News.",
      "Federal laws mandate audits and verification processes to maintain accurate employment records, and the lower rate of response to the email is no doubt due to multiple agencies instructing staff to not reply.",
      "At least half of all federal employees have not responded to the email, which was sent by the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday and came with a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Monday. The heads of numerous agencies, including the Justice Department, the FBI, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, told employees to ignore the email. Those agencies have over 537,000 employees, according to September 2024 employment numbers.",
      "The personnel office allowed agencies to decide how they wanted to handle the email, despite Musk warning that those who did not respond would lose their jobs.",
      "CBS News has not received responses for requests for information about Musk's claims from the Office of Personnel Management or the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "How the federal government keeps track of its workers",
      "Federal employees must verify their identity and employment authorization by filling out an I-9 before being hired and often have their fingerprints taken. Federal law requires that agencies keep \"complete and accurate records\" of the hours their employees work and establish work schedules.",
      "While there are occasional instances of fraud, the Government Accountability Office found in 2020 that cases are rare. Between fiscal years 2015 to 2019, agency inspectors general substantiated only 100 allegations of employee time and attendance misconduct or fraud out of a federal workforce of around 2.1 million employees (the GAO report did not include postal workers). The report did not mention any instances of dead or fictitious employees getting paid.",
      "The report noted several checks and balances in place to prevent and detect fraud, including the use of timesheets, badge in-out data, video surveillance, network login information and government-issued routers, GAOs report said.",
      "Pattern of false claims about dead people",
      "Previously, Musk and Mr. Trump had falsely claimed that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old were collecting Social Security payments.",
      "But acting Social Security Administration commissioner Lee Dudek said people who are listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits.\" Instead, those individuals \"are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,\" Dudek said.",
      "Unless you qualify for survivor benefits, collecting Social Security payments for a deceased person is illegal. While there have been documented instances of payments to deceased beneficiaries, they do not occur near the scale the Trump administration suggested.",
      "In total, improper payments at the agency \u2014 including all accidental overpayments and underpayments \u2014 accounted for just under 1% of the $8.6 trillion in total payments from 2015 to 2022, according to a 2024 audit.",
      "Mr. Trump also has a long history of making false claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election by people who cast ballots in the name of dead people \u2014 claims which have been repeatedly debunked.",

      "But some of those who received the binder said there was little new information in the files. Bondi later released a statement with links to the documents, and said, \"The first phase of declassified files largely contains documents that have been previously leaked but never released in a formal capacity by the U.S. Government.\"",
      "Liz Wheeler, who was seen leaving the White House, went live on X\u00a0later in the day to describe the binder and flip through its contents. She said that while people are looking for new information related to the Epstein case, \"that's not what's in\" the folder. Most of the pages that Wheeler showed were from Epstein's address book, which has long been public, with addresses redacted.",

    "summary": "The government runs out of funding on March 14, and averting a shutdown will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is barreling toward a deadline to avert a government shutdown in just over two weeks, with Democrats and Republicans at odds over whether there should be guardrails on President Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress.",
      "Democrats want to insert language in the funding bill to ensure that the administration implements the spending directed by Congress, a reaction to Mr. Trump and top adviser Elon Musk's work to downsize large swaths of the executive branch. But Republicans have made it clear that they won't accept those terms.",
      "Government funding expires on March 14, and keeping the government open past the deadline will likely require bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Republicans control 53 seats in the Senate, but a funding measure requires 60 votes for passage. In the House, Republicans are operating with a razor-thin majority and a divided conference in which conservatives regularly vote against government spending bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday that a continuing resolution that funds the government at the current levels is the \"most reasonable thing to do to ensure that the government is not shut down.\"",
      "It has yet to be determined whether disaster relief for the California wildfires would be included in the funding measure, but Johnson told reporters it likely would not include language to codify cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the Musk-led task force that is slashing programs across the executive branch.",
      "\"It probably is as close to a clean CR as possible,\" he said of the potential path forward.",
      "Johnson's comments came after a meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "But in an interview with CNN later in the evening, Johnson noted that the CR might include some \"anomalies,\" opening the door to spending cuts that would alienate most Democrats.",
      "\"You can increase some spending, you can decrease some spending. You can add language that says, for example, the dramatic changes that have been made to USAID would be reflected in the ongoing spending,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a clean CR, mostly, I think, but with some of those changes to adapt to the new realities here.\"",
      "Thursday evening, Mr. Trump announced his support for a \"a clean, temporary\" continuing resolution, telling Congress, \"Let's get it done!\"",
      "Democratic leaders have said the blame for any shutdown would lie squarely with Republicans, who control the House, Senate and the White House. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that Democrats don't want a shutdown and are at the table negotiating in good faith to fund the government.",
      "\"But Republicans are the majority in the House and in the Senate. If they want our votes, they need to work with us,\" Murray said, noting that appropriators are \"close\" on topline spending.",
      "\"We need to know Republicans are willing to work with us to protect Congress' power of the purse,\" Murray said. \"That is the absolute bare minimum, and it's frankly not asking a whole lot.\"",
      "Republicans \"should not follow Elon toward a shutdown,\" Murray said.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the Senate's top Republican appropriator, and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, her counterpart in the House, met with Johnson and Thune on Wednesday morning to discuss government funding.",
      "Cole said he and Collins are on the same page, but do have differences with Democrats on \"some of the restrictions that they're demanding on what we consider legitimate presidential authority.\" He added that Republicans are \"not moving on that.\"",
      "\"That's a no-go, that's a red line that we're not changing our position on and they know that \u2014 that's been communicated consistently,\" Cole said.",
      "Johnson said Democrats have \"had completely unreasonable conditions assigned to this.\"",
      "\"They want us to limit the power of the executive branch, they want us to stipulate in the appropriations bills for the first time in history that certain agencies in the executive branch would have to have a specific number of employees, all sorts of just unreasonable \u2014 what I think are unconstitutional \u2014 demands,\" Johnson said. \"It would be a violation of separation of powers. So we're pretty far apart right now, but it is not because of Republicans, it's because of the Democrats.\"",
      "The funding fight comes as Republicans in Congress have also been moving ahead on a separate budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for approving Mr. Trump's agenda on issues ranging from border security to energy and taxes. Though the two issues are distinctly separate, the focus on the budget has taken center stage in recent weeks, appearing to sideline progress toward government funding.",

      "Several female athletes who stood next to President Trump three weeks ago to celebrate an executive order banning transgender participation in women's sports were not invited to a White House event Thursday for a briefing on women's sports after they criticized the National Collegiate Athletic Association's new policy, sources told CBS News.",
      "Among those who didn't get asked back for the briefing on Title IX issues were Riley Gaines, a former NCAA swimmer; Sia Liilii, captain of the University of Nevada's women's volleyball team; and Kaitynn Wheeler, a former NCAA swimmer at the University of Kentucky.",
      "Some of the athletes have publicly clashed with the White House's preferred messaging by openly criticizing the NCAA in social media posts and other public statements.",
      "\"It's absolutely not a win at all and we need to demand for better,\" Wheeler told CBS News.",
      "White House officials told CBS that Thursday's Title IX event is for state attorneys general and is an effort to encourage them to use sex discrimination authorities already in place in their states to protect women and girls in athletics.",
      "Sports figures whose stories haven't yet been highlighted by the Trump administration were invited, they said. Some athletes from Maine, whose Democratic governor has said she will fight Mr. Trump's order in court, will be there, one of the officials said.",
      "After Mr. Trump earlier this month signed the executive order titled \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" the NCAA \u2014 the nonprofit that governs college sports \u2014 issued a new policy stating a \"student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete for an NCAA women's team.\"",
      "White House officials said they think the NCAA policy is a victory for Mr. Trump because the organization is not accepting amended birth certificates and is being more aggressive than other sporting organizations such as the Ladies Professional Golf Association, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, and the International Rugby League.",
      "However, some of the women athletes and advocates at the photo opportunity with Mr. Trump have since argued the NCAA policy has major loopholes and continues to allow male athletes to compete in women's sports.",
      "Payton McNabb, a 17-year-old who was injured during a collision with a transgender female athlete during a volleyball game, was initially invited to Thursday's event, but it was unclear if she would attend, people familiar with the matter said. Liilii was invited and later asked not to come, they said.",
      "Jennifer Sey, a former gymnast and business executive who has been an advocate for keeping transgender women out of women's sports, said the sports governance landscape is complicated - multiple bodies govern various corners of sports. Olympics and independent events such as the Boston Marathon can claim they're outside the executive order because they don't receive federal funding, she said.",
      "\"It's very fractured \u2014 there was no way an EO was going to be able to solve the entire problem. It was a great first step,\" Sey said. \"But in the meantime, I think the NCAA policy is wildly insufficient.\"",
      "Sey, who was invited to the White House for the executive order event but not Thursday's briefing, said she and others hope Mr. Trump will pressure the NCAA to redo it. \"It should be thrown in the garbage,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 A Senate committee voted to advance former GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer's nomination to lead the Labor Department under President Trump on Thursday with the help of a trio of Democrats.",
      "The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions voted 14 to 9 on Thursday to advance Chavez-DeRemer's nomination for a vote in the full Senate. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the sole Republican to vote against her nomination, while three Democrats \u2014 Sens. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia \u2014 voted in favor. GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska did not originally cast a vote, but the committee later allowed her to record herself as a \"yes.\"",
      "Paul said he would oppose her because of her previous support for pro-labor policies. Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress, which did not advance past introduction. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize. During her confirmation hearing last week, the former lawmaker addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect\" and she backs right-to-work laws, which allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",
      "Without Paul, Chavez-DeRemer needed at least one Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee to vote to advance her nomination. Republicans have a 12-11 vote majority on the panel.",
      "Hassan of New Hampshire said in a statement this week that she would support Mr. Trump's nominee, all but ensuring that Chavez-DeRemer had the votes needed to advance, barring any surprise opposition from other Republican committee members.",
      "\"Though we may not agree on everything, after meeting with Representative Chavez-DeRemer and listening to her testimony during her confirmation hearing, I believe that she is qualified to serve as the next Secretary of Labor and I look forward to working with her to support New Hampshire's workers and small businesses,\" Hassan said in a statement.",
      "Hickenlooper told CBS News on Tuesday that he was also considering supporting Chavez-DeRemer's nomination. The Colorado Democrat cited Chavez-DeRemer's support for youth apprenticeships, an issue he has worked on for nearly a decade, as a positive. And though he called her shifting stance on the PRO Act \"a little disconcerting,\" he acknowledged that she is \"serving at the will of the president.\"",

      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on Jan. 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "But according to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 0.004% chance of the asteroid striking Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. NASA on Feb. 24 said, \"There is no significant potential for this asteroid to impact our planet for the next century.\"",

      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75% of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency when the odds of an impact were higher.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would have been expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy ... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If such an explosion occurred over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "Aside from the nearly 0% chance the asteroid will miss Earth, the good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare if something were to change.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",

      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",

      "With two commercial moon landers already on their way, Houston-based Intuitive Machines launched its second robotic lander atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, the centerpiece of a multi-element NASA-sponsored mission to help pave the way for human expeditions.",
      "The workhorse rocket's nine first-stage engines roared to life at  7:16 p.m. EST, pushing the booster away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.9 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month.

      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",

It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",

      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Over the last month, the U.S. government has worked quickly to pause, disband and dismantle the U.S. effort to fight foreign meddling in elections, raising concern among federal lawmakers and election officials across the country who rely on the federal cybersecurity agency and its counterparts to warn them about attacks on election systems.",
      "First came a flurry of notices forcing out Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency personnel who are tasked with stopping foreign interference in U.S. elections \u2014 at least a dozen have been put on leave or fired over the past month. Then, on Attorney General Pam Bondi's first day in office on Feb. 5, she disbanded the FBI task force targeting foreign influence operations originating from places like Russia, China and Iran.",
      "The focus on election security has been turned toward the past, rather than the future. In an internal memo earlier this month, CISA's acting director announced an internal investigation to assess every position and program that touches election security \u2014 including election misinformation and disinformation \u2014 dating back to President Trump's first term in office, with findings to be delivered in a final report on March 6.",
      "The message, penned by Acting Director Bridget Bean and first reported by Wired, also revealed the defunding of a nationwide program to train state and local government officials and offer threat monitoring services through a center known as the \"Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.\"",
      "\"It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission,\" Bean wrote in the message, echoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's assertion during her confirmation hearing that the agency had strayed \"far off mission.\"",
      "The memo landed in the mailboxes of CISA's roughly 3,400 personnel on Valentine's Day, hours before more than 130 probationary workers \u2013 roughly 4% of the nation's cyberdefense agency \u2014 were summarily fired with form-letter terminations.",
      "Top Democrats on the Senate and House committees overseeing election legislation expressed \"grave concern\" over the changes in a letter to CISA's top leaders, noting the agency's \"establishing legislation clearly directs it to work on elections.\"",
      "\"We're here because in 2016 a foreign government \u2014 Russia \u2014 tried to tamper with our stuff,\" Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told CBS News. \"They tried to physically hack into election systems,\" he added, noting Minnesota was just one of 21 states targeted, setting into motion a January 2017 designation of elections as critical infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to President Trump, Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes likened the cuts to shutting down the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ahead of hurricane season. \"This decision undermines Arizona's election security at a time when our enemies around the world are using online tools to push their agendas and ideologies into our very homes,\" he wrote.",
      "The moves come months after CISA and the FBI aided states responding to a slew of Election Day bomb threats and white powder mailings. Officials debunked phony Russian-linked videos\u00a0purporting to depict election workers destroying ballots during nationwide voting, and an FBI investigation outed a hack-and-leak operation that stole documents from Mr. Trump's campaign, leading to the indictment of three Iranian cyber operatives.",
      "CISA and the FBI possess a broader view of the threat landscape that election officials find to be helpful in sizing up the threats facing them. \"You know it would be difficult to comprehend 50 states doing this on their own,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt told CBS News. \"Each state runs elections in accordance with federal and state law\u2026 but no state has a national or global perspective on the nature of threats and the capabilities of bad faith actors seeking to disrupt our electoral process.\"",
      "While state and local governments run elections nationwide, federal agencies like CISA and the FBI coordinate with election offices to help safeguard against rising cyber and physical threats, while uncovering foreign influence campaigns designed to sow division among Americans and uproot voter confidence.",
      "\"States can often see only the effects of the attacks \u2014 disinformation directed at them and their voters and threats, but they have no insight into where those attacks are coming from, and therefore, have a limited ability to respond,\" said David Becker, CBS News election law expert and political contributor. \"CISA, the FBI Foreign Influence Task Force, and others, have that 'birds-eye view' insight, both detecting the source of the attacks \u2014 domestic or foreign, nations or criminal actors \u2014 as well as how they all fit into the big picture.\"",
      "In a letter to the DHS secretary on Friday, nearly 40 chief election officials wrote to try to persuade Noem to maintain cybersecurity and physical security services provided to states. \"Information technology systems related to election administration have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including nation-state and cybercriminal groups,\" leaders of the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote. \"CISA's prioritized services help election entities defend against these national security threats.\"",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that \"CISA needs to refocus on its mission\" and is \"undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to mis-, dis-, and malinformation.\"",
      "But the cuts across CISA and the FBI targeted teams may not only affect their ability to identify false content online but could also affect safeguards protecting election infrastructure from being undermined, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials. The teams have rooted out covert operations from Russia, China and Iran in the last year alone. Among the cyber agency employees targeted are members of CISA's Election Security Resilience Team, the Cybersecurity Advisory Committee and Regional Election Security Advisors, multiple current and former federal and state officials told CBS News.",
      "The new administration has not yet nominated a new CISA director, with the agency's highest-ranking political appointee, Karen Evans, now serving as a senior adviser.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attempted to fire the chair of the Federal Election Commission, a move that coincides with the adjudication of campaign finance complaints from the 2024 election, including those against tech billionaire and presidential ally Elon Musk.",
      "Mr. Trump and some conservatives on Capitol Hill have accused CISA of policing speech by coordinating with social media companies to identify online misinformation and disinformation ahead of the 2020 election. They accused the agency of \"censorship,\" which CISA officials have repeatedly denied. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit over the government's work, but the blowback prompted CISA to curb those conversations with tech platforms in 2021, according to three former U.S. officials.",
      "\"That is not our role, that's not what we do,\" former CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters last year, ahead of the 2024 election. \"We're looking to work with our partners on overall threats to election infrastructure.\"",
      "CISA's ongoing internal probe appears to follow a Jan. 20-related directive instructing the attorney general and agency leaders to investigate Biden administration activities that are \"inconsistent\" with Trump's vow to end \"online censorship.\"",
      "DHS and CISA did not immediately respond to CBS News' questions about who directed the audit and would not say whether the report would be publicly released. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about whether the attorney general would be consulted on the investigation.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Feb 2025 16:19:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A 9-year-old's mission to get a bionic arm led to a story about the power of kindness \u2014 and an inspiring new friendship.",
    "story": [
      "Remi Bateman was born without her left forearm and hand but she doesn't let it slow her down.",
      "Now 9 years old, Bateman is busy riding her bike and scooter around her neighborhood in Utah \u2014 and she's got her sights set on doing even more daily tasks, like cutting her own food and doing her own hair.",
      "Remi has been using a silicone prosthesis, covered by her health insurance, since she was 6 months old. While the prosthetic is helpful, it's heavy and doesn't give her the ability to move fingers.",
      "\"Her current prosthetic is pretty stationary and doesn't do a lot,\" her mother, Jami, told \"CBS Mornings.\" The hand on Remi's prosthesis was molded into a plastic fist.",
      "A \"life changing\" mission",
      "Last year, Jami came across a social media post for\u00a0Open Bionics\u00a0and its 3D-printed multi-grip \"Hero Arm.\" Each finger has its own motor, making it possible to grip everyday items with precision. Within 48 hours, Jami and her husband, Josh, scheduled a video consultation with Open Bionics and drove to their clinic in Denver, Colorado for an initial fitting.",
      "\"It was life changing,\" Jami said. \"This bionic arm is like 95% of having a real hand.\"",
      "The Batemans hoped insurance would help pay for the Hero Arm but their provider denied coverage, saying it wasn't \"medically necessary,\" according to Jami. Without insurance, the bionic arm cost $24,000.",
      "\"I do understand that you can live just fine without [a hand], but imagine what you could do with two hands. I feel like the whole world is built around having two hands,\" Jami said.",
      "Like many Americans with medical needs not covered by insurance, the Batemans turned to crowdsourcing.",
      "On Dec. 10, 2024, Remi's fight for her Hero Arm made the local news. Within four days, the Batemans raised over $24,000. Andy Schoonover, CEO of\u00a0CrowdHealth, a subscriber-based crowdfunding platform for medical bills, also contacted the Batemans after seeing their plea for help online.",
      "\"He told me he would pay for Remi's hand in cash,\" said Jami.",
      "And that's where the story takes a turn.",
      "Paying it forward",
      "With Schoonover's gift, Jami realized they still had $24,000 in donations. She asked her daughter what she wanted to do with it.",
      "\"Help more kids,\" Remi enthusiastically replied. \"So people can actually have a life-changing arm like me.\"",
      "Across the country in Maryland, 9-year-old Tyraun \"Taj\" Johnson was also trying to raise money for a Hero Arm. He was born with a partial left hand. His family worked hand specialists at Johns Hopkins Medicine to look at surgery and different prosthesis options to give him some usage of his left hand. They were hopeful the Hero Arm could be the solution they were searching for.",
      "But like Remi, Taj's health insurance company denied the coverage of the Hero Arm. His family was devastated.",
      "\"You're telling me that a kid able to function with daily tasks \u2013 something as small as feeding themselves, getting dressed...You're telling me that that's not medically necessary?\" his mother, Kaitlin Skinner, asked.",
      "\"I would give Taj my left hand if I could,\" Kaitlin added.",
      "The family started lemonade stands to raise the money for the bionic arm. In four months, they had only made $1,500.",
      "Then they got a life-changing call from Remi's mom. The Bateman's offered to use the donations they received for Remi's arm for Taj's Hero Arm.",
      "Open Bionics helped connect the families. Samantha Payne, co-founder of Open Bionics, told CBS News clinicians spend a lot of time assisting families in appealing insurance denials.\u00a0 \"The technology is 20 years old and has been tested,\" added Payne.",
      "A dream come true",
      "Kaitlin was brought to tears by the Batemans' generous offer and thanked them for making Taj's dream come true.",
      "\"Taj got teary eyed when he saw a video of Remi holding a fork with the Hero Arm,\" Kaitlin said. One of the things Taj is most looking forward to is playing sports.",
      "Kaitlin recently drove to New York City with Taj to meet Daniel Green, upper limb prosthetist at Open Bionics, who will make the mold that will become Taj's Hero Arm. While in New York, Taj had a surprise visitor: Remi and her mom. They arrived at our invitation.",
      "A new friendship forged through the kindness of strangers. Remi and Taj plan to meet again during the summer.",
      "\"If we have a playdate with our [Hero] robot arms, we could be like Ironman,\" Remi said.",
      "Donations for Remi continued to pour in. So she's continued to pay it forward, using the fund to help two more 11 year olds fund their Hero Arms after insurance denied their claims.",

      "The U.S. sought to extradite Caro Quintero shortly after his re-arrest, but the request was stuck at Mexico's foreign ministry as the country's then-president curtailed its cooperation with the DEA in protest over U.S. law enforcement operations targeting senior political and military officials.",
      "In January, a nonprofit group representing the Camarena family sent a letter urging the White House to renew the request, according to a copy of the letter provided to The Associated Press.",

      "At the time, Caro Quintero was one of the primary suppliers of heroin, cocaine and marijuana to the U.S. in the late 1970s. He blamed Camarena for a 1984 raid by Mexican authorities on a marijuana plantation, Rancho Bufalo, that upset his business. The DEA said at the time it was the largest drug seizure ever.",

      "The attack marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations.",

    "summary": "In the weeks since the White House began targeting USAID for closure, services to a variety of life-saving causes have faltered.",
    "story": [
      "When Navyn Salem received a letter Wednesday terminating the federal government's contract with her Rhode Island company, Edesia, she halted its production line, which makes a life-saving paste for severely malnourished babies.",
      "A day later she received an email, just a few short sentences, rescinding the contract's termination.",
      "The reversal failed to put her mind at ease.",
      "\"This is what our everyday looks like. The government is in a state of chaos,\" Salem said. \"And the way that we see that is 24 hours ago, we had a contract terminated, and 10 minutes ago [the termination] was rescinded.\"",
      "In the weeks since Elon Musk, an adviser to President Trump and the richest person in the world, began targeting the State Department agency USAID for closure, disruptions to the supply chain and services for a variety of global life-saving causes have faltered.",
      "While Salem's contract has remained active, except for most of Wednesday, she said the hollowing out of USAID \u2014 with nearly all of its staff suddenly placed on leave or outright fired \u2014 has caused growing disarray. Most pressing, she said, is that the USAID-operated payment system she relies on \"has been down for weeks.\"",
      "That's created unparalleled uncertainty that is spreading from her business of 150 employees to her American suppliers \u2014 farmers across 25 states \u2014 and the U.S. ocean liners she uses to ship hundreds of metric tons of Edesia's Plumpy'Nut therapeutic paste, and finally, to the international organizations that distribute it to children staving off death.",
      "\"Everybody who is caught up in this time of chaos with massive uncertainty is worried. Everybody is,\" Salem said.",
      "Plumpy'Nut is classified as a ready-to-use therapeutic food, prescribed for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children as young as six months old. It's a peanut-based paste that includes vitamins, minerals and F-100 milk powder, in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Edesia says it produces 800 metric tons of Plumpy'Nut and other foods used to treat malnutrition every week.",
      "Salem believes ultimately that her company's goal of protecting children aligns with Trump administration priorities. \"We have a strong belief that our mission will be protected, that these funds will be there, but I can't promise that to anyone.\"",
      "Salem said she agrees that USAID could be operated more efficiently, and she has ideas from years of work with the agency. She faces the same dilemma, whether she wants to propose solutions or simply try to process payments.",
      "\"Who should I call?\" She asked. \"I have been offering suggestions for years, and now is the time for someone to listen, if I can just find someone who will pick up the phone.\"",
      "A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that it had ended more than 90% of its USAID contracts, retaining only those that it believes make America stronger, safer and more prosperous. The agency's cuts are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to drastically shrink the federal workforce and budget.",
      "Each packet of Plumpy'Nut produced by Edesia is printed with the phrase \"from the American people\" printed on it. Salem said the message to the desperate parents and caretakers of malnourished children is an important part of her company's mission.",
      "\"They will never, ever forget that it was the American people who were there for them in their biggest time of crisis,\" Salem said.",
      "She and others who run organizations associated with USAID told CBS News another global superpower is poised to step in if the United States retreats from corners of the world where it provides support for crucial medical care: China.",
      "\"This is an incredibly strong use of soft power to deliver a food, a specialized food to people in their biggest time of need,\" Salem said.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:41:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "summary": "The move supercharges RFK Jr.'s authority to implement health policy changes.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ended a longstanding transparency rule on Friday, supercharging his authority to change policies in areas ranging from Medicaid to the National Institutes of Health without advance notice to the public.",
      "Dubbed the \"Richardson Waiver\" after the former health secretary who issued the rule in 1971, the policy Kennedy repealed had required regulations related to property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts to go through the federal \"rulemaking\" process.",
      "The law governing rulemaking usually exempts such regulations, but in response to calls at the time to close the exemption, officials voluntarily waived it. This meant that, until now, they would go through the process of notifying the public of their proposals and asking for comments before imposing changes.",
      "\"The extra-statutory obligations of the Richardson Waiver impose costs on the Department and the public, are contrary to the efficient operation of the Department, and impede the Department's flexibility to adapt quickly to legal and policy mandates,\" Kennedy said in a filing announcing the end of the waiver.",
      "Now health agencies no longer need to go through the notice and comment process for many policy changes about grants and benefits. This includes new rules that could otherwise be stymied by backlash during a public comment period, like potentially adding in work requirements to Medicaid or redrawing how the National Institutes of Health funds research.",
      "\"It's hugely important, because getting rid of the Richardson Waiver means that the agency can move a lot faster to implement big new policy changes,\" said Samuel Bagenstos, professor of law at the University of Michigan.",
      "Bagenstos previously worked as the general counsel for HHS under the Biden administration. He said following the policy was a major hurdle, bogging down proposals that might have otherwise been finalized.",
      "\"Courts have held HHS to that waiver, so it's not just something they could ignore,\" he said. \"If you think about HHS, it's a $1.7 trillion department. The overwhelming majority of what it does is grants and benefits.\"",
      "The waiver was also cited earlier this month by state attorneys general as one argument in their legal challenge seeking to block the National Institutes of Health's controversial cuts to research funding. They quoted the first Trump administration supporting the waiver in a 2020 post by the department to the Federal Register.",
      "\"The Department believes that its decision-making ought to be as transparent as appropriate to better enable the citizenry to comment on its proposed rules and demonstration projects,\" Trump HHS officials had said.",
      "The Council on Governmental Relations, a group that represents research universities and other institutions, criticized Kennedy's decision Friday.

    "summary": "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\"one Social Security Administration employee said of the agency's plans to slash its workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "summary": "Iowa's governor signed legislation removing gender identity protections on Friday from the state's civil rights code, despite large, intense protests.",
    "story": [
      "Des Moines, Iowa \u2014\u00a0 Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation to remove gender identity protections from the state's civil rights code on Friday.",
      "In a statement released by her office after the bill was signed, Reynolds \u2013 a Republican and first woman to hold the governor's office in Iowa \u2014 said the Civil Rights Code blurred the biological line between the sexes and forced Iowa taxpayers to pay for gender reassignment surgeries.",
      "She said it was \"unacceptable to me, and it is unacceptable to most Iowans,\" saying the bill simply brings the state in line with the federal Civil Rights Code.",
      "\"We all agree that every Iowan, without exception, deserves respect and dignity. We are all children of God, and no law changes that,\" Reynolds said in the statement.",
      "\"What this bill does accomplish is to strengthen protections for women and girls, and I believe that is the right thing to do.\"",
      "Iowa lawmakers became the first in the nation to approve legislation removing gender identity protections from the state's civil rights code Thursday, despite massive protests by opponents who say it could expose transgender people to discrimination in numerous areas of life.",
      "The measure raced through the legislative process after first being introduced last week. The state Senate was first to approve the bill on Thursday, on party lines, followed by the House less than an hour later. Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in voting against it.",
      "The bill would remove gender identity as a protected class from the state's civil rights law and explicitly define female and male, as well as gender, which would be considered a synonym for sex and \"shall not be considered a synonym or shorthand expression for gender identity, experienced gender, gender expression, or gender role.\"",
      "The measure would be the first legislative action in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who signed earlier policies banning sports participation and public bathroom access for transgender students. A spokesperson for Reynolds declined to comment on whether she would sign the bill. If she does, it will go into effect on July 1.",
      "Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on Thursday waving signs reading \"Trans rights are human rights\" and chanting slogans including \"No hate in our state!\"",
      "There was a heavy police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. Of the 167 people who signed up to testify at a 90-minute public hearing before a House committee, all but 24 were opposed to the bill.",
      "Protesters who watched the vote from the House gallery loudly booed and shouted \"Shame!\" as the chamber adjourned. Many admonished Iowa state Rep. Steven Holt, who floor managed the bill and fiercely defended it before it passed.",
      "Supporters of the change say the current law incorrectly codified the idea that people can transition to another gender and granted transgender women access to spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms and sports teams that should be protected for people who were assigned female at birth. Holt said the inclusion of gender identity in the civil rights codes threatens what he called \"commonsense\" laws to ban transgender participation in sports\u00a0and access to bathrooms.",
      "\"The legislature of Iowa for the future of our children and our culture has a vested interest and solemn responsibility to stand up for immutable truth,\" Holt said.",
      "The Iowa lawmakers' actions came as the Georgia House backed away from removing gender protections from the state's hate crimes law, which was passed in 2020 after the death of Ahmaud Arbery.",
      "Iowa's current civil rights law protects against discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin or disability status.",
      "Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included in the state's Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, also with the support of about a dozen Republicans across the two chambers.",
      "Iowa state Rep. Aime Wichtendahl was the last Democrat to speak out Thursday against the bill removing those protections, becoming emotional as she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: \"I transitioned to save my life.\"",
      "\"The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,\" Wichtendahl said. \"The sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill is to make our existence illegal.\"",
      "When she finished speaking, she got a standing ovation from many legislators and onlookers in the gallery, reports CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI-TV.",
      "The station said that after the Senate passed the bill, a man started yelling from the gallery, calling lawmakers \"fascists\" and asking \"Who's next?\" Three state troopers carried him out. Others who were yelling were also removed.",
      "About half of U.S. states include gender identity in their civil rights code to protect against discrimination in housing and public places, such as stores or restaurants, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Some additional states do not explicitly protect against such discrimination but it is included in legal interpretations of statutes.",
      "Iowa's Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Several Republican-led legislatures are pushing to enact more laws this year creating legal definitions of male and female based on the reproductive organs at birth following an executive order from President Trump.",
      "He also signed orders laying the groundwork for banning transgender people from military service and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women's sports competitions, among other things. Most of the policies are being challenged in court.",
      "On Thursday night, Mr. Trump wrote on his Truth Social site: \"Iowa, a beautiful State that I have won BIG every time, has a Bill to remove Radical Gender Ideology from their Laws. Iowa should follow the lead of my Executive Order, saying there are only two genders, and pass this Bill \u2014 AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. Thank you Iowa!\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

    "story": [
      "With a rifle in her hands, Helen Mirren\u00a0brings steely determination to her role as Cara Dutton in \"1923,\" the latest chapter of Taylor Sheridan's \"Yellowstone\" saga that continues to break viewership records.",
      "The second season premiere drew more than 5.4 million viewers \u2014 the biggest original premiere in Paramount+ history. The series transports viewers back to a harsh and unforgiving American West of a century ago.",
      "The 79-year-old Oscar winner embraces the challenging role of the Dutton family matriarch alongside co-star Harrison Ford, confronting everything from mountain lions to the harsh realities of frontier life.",
      "\"It's kind of the American 'War and Peace,'\" Mirren said in an interview. \"It's kind of looking at the big movement of history in America, hopefully with honesty and truth, and not shying away from the incredible racism, the violence, the brutality, the courage.\"",
      "Unlike many Hollywood westerns of the past, \"1923\" avoids romanticizing the era.",
      "\"I think it's a period that has been looked at over and over again, and romanticized, and whitewashed, certainly throughout the '50s and '60s,\" Mirren noted.",
      "To prepare for the role, Mirren attended \"Cowboy Camp\" where she overcame her fear of horses and learned to drive a horse-drawn buggy.",
      "The series reunites Mirren with Ford nearly 40 years after they first worked together on \"The Mosquito Coast.\" At that time, Mirren was already celebrated for her Shakespearean stage roles in Britain.",
      "\"I absolutely adore him,\" Mirren said of Ford. \"His trajectory and the way he is is so remarkable and a lovely thing to be in the presence of.\"",
      "Mirren's illustrious career includes an Academy Award\u00a0for \"The Queen,\" three Golden Globes, five Emmys and a Tony Award. Her versatility has allowed her to portray characters ranging from an embittered housekeeper in \"Gosford Park\" to a hard-boiled assassin in \"Red\" and even the narrator in Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie.\"",
      "When asked about her attraction to strong female characters, Mirren explained, \"Your dream as an actress is to find a role that \u2013 especially as a woman, incidentally \u2013 that has agency and passion and courage.\"",
      "She particularly values portraying the complex relationship between Cara and Jacob Dutton.",
      "\"They've faced so many challenges together over the years. I love to see that relationship on the screen,\" she said.",
      "Off screen, Mirren has her own American connection. She is married to American director Taylor Hackford and became a U.S. citizen in 2017.",
      "\"They do a lovely thing when you arrive in America with an American passport. They say, 'welcome home,'\" she recalled. \"The first time I presented my passport and he said 'welcome home,' it was a fantastic, wonderful moment. It made me cry.\"",

      "This time, the email is expected to come from individual federal agencies, not the Office of Personnel Management, as was the case with the\u00a0email circulated to the federal workforce last week. That government-wide directive caused confusion as to whether a response was required \u2014 and the possible ramifications of not answering.",
      "With this round of emails, OPM advised agencies to send the messages themselves, and each department has the discretion to decide to whether to do so, sources told CBS News. The emails are part of a strategy to have agencies account for their employees' work each week and report it back to the government's human resources agency, though no decision has been made about whether the messages will go out weekly, the sources said.",
      "In addition to the individual agencies deciding whether to send the emails, each will decide how long their workforces have to respond and the consequences of not replying, CBS News has learned.",
      "Since returning to the White House, President Trump has made reducing the size of the federal government a key part of his second-term agenda. He tasked Elon Musk to lead the cost-cutting effort through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, though the billionaire is not the administrator of the task force. The White House confirmed earlier this week that Amy Gleason, who worked at the U.S. Digital Service, the precursor to DOGE, is its acting administrator.",
      "But Musk and his team have roiled the federal government with their initiative; as thousands of probationary federal workers were fired, DOGE employees have sought access to departments' data systems housing sensitive information and work at some independent agencies has ground to a halt.",
      "Their actions have sparked numerous lawsuits, and on Thursday, a federal judge in California found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful.",
      "The initial round of emails sent to the federal workforce last Saturday came from OPM with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" It directed recipients to reply with five examples of what they accomplished in the prior week and include their bosses in the response. Government employees had until 11:59 p.m. Monday to answer and were told not to \"send any classified information, links, or attachments.\"",
      "Musk had initially warned on social media that a failure to respond \"will be taken as a resignation,\" but several agencies, including the FBI and Departments of State, Homeland Security and Defense, told their employees to ignore the request. OPM then told human resources officials from departments Monday that it was up to each agency to decide how they would handle the emails to their workers.",
      "But a memo also sent Monday to agency leaders that sought to provide guidance on the government-wide \"what did you do last week\" email said responses should be directed to department leadership, with a copy going to OPM.",
      "It said \"agencies should review responses and evaluate nonresponses.\" The memo did not mention the directions given by department heads that instructed their workforce not to reply.",
      "Roughly 1 million federal workers responded to the first \"what did you do last week\" email. Mr. Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday that those who didn't reply \"are on the bubble\" and said his administration wasn't \"thrilled\" about the non-responses.",

    "story": [
      "When authorities in Greenwood, South Carolina, arrived at the deserted intersection after 1 a.m. on May 7, 2023, they found a mangled BMW sedan in the road with debris scattered around it. On the shoulder near the woods, lay the car's fatally injured owner, 46-year-old Davis McClendon. But something about the scene seemed strange.",
      "McClendon was about 50 feet away from his car, suggesting he'd been outside standing next to it and been hit. His shirt and shoe were lying on the pavement. There was no other vehicle with relevant damage.",
      "McClendon's girlfriend, Meredith Haynie, was there by the time authorities appeared, but she said she hadn't been there to see the collision. Authorities would use an array of evidence to build a murder case against Haynie's soon-to-be-ex-husband Bud Ackerman, who would claim hitting McClendon with his truck had been an accident. But prosecutors argued the touch screen computer in the dashboard of Ackerman's Ford F-250 pickup truck provided a blueprint of the intent they needed to prove he'd been targeting McClendon that night \u2014 and killed him with \"malice aforethought.\"",
      "Haynie tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Anne Marie Green she'd been on a date with McClendon that night, before he'd vanished out of a local club at 12:51 a.m. Haynie's only TV interview is featured in \"The Hit-and-Run Homicide of Davis McClendon,\" airing Saturday, March 1, 2025 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Haynie told authorities she and McClendon had begun the evening at a restaurant called Break on the Lake. Next, they'd gone to a party and then to a well-known club called Key West. When McClendon suddenly left out the back door, she said she had suspected he was going to meet Ackerman, who had been critical of her and McClendon for seeing each other before Ackerman's and Haynie's divorce was final. She said Ackerman had been compulsively calling her that night. And she allowed investigators access to her phone, which turned out to contain texts supporting her account.",
      "\"What did the text messages reveal?\" Green asked lead detective Lt. Matthew Womack of the Greenwood County Sheriff's Office.",
      "\"It showed the pattern of what she was explaining to the on-scene investigators,\" Womack replied. \"Like him calling multiple times, him texting multiple times, things of that nature.\"",
      "Within minutes of arriving at the scene of the crash, authorities suspected Ackerman had run McClendon down. There was an oil trail leading from the crash site directly to the house where Ackerman was living. And evidence suggested Ackerman's pickup sideswiped the sedan, hitting McClendon next to the driver's door, carrying him across the road and depositing his body where it was found.",
      "Having heard Haynie's story, investigators hoped they could get more information from Ackerman himself. They soon located him at his parents' home about a half mile from the crash site and they found his pickup truck leaking oil in the driveway. But when they tried to question him, Ackerman referred them to his attorney.",
      "In the coming days, investigators would retrieve time-stamped video showing Ackerman at the locations where Haynie and McClendon had spent their evening out and soon afterward, near the crash site itself. But Ackerman still wasn't talking much to them.",
      "That's when his truck started speaking for him.",
      "Womack says the touch screen computers or \"infotainment systems\" in many modern cars measure and store incredibly detailed information about how, when and where the vehicle is being operated. And Ackerman's pickup truck was no exception. When authorities extracted data from the onboard computer, they found a motherlode of incriminating measurements.",
      "\"\u2026 In a 24-hour time period, it's over 3,000 events \u2026\" Womack told Green. \"And then each one is time-stamped \u2026 for each event.\"",
      "He says Ackerman's \"infotainment system\" logged a series of communications almost like \u00a0digital \"handshakes,\" in which the truck automatically pinged public Wi-Fi systems it happened to pass.",
      "\"\u2026Let's just say there was \u2026 a fast-food restaurant \u2026 and the device will do what we call a handshake with that,\" Womack explained. \"Essentially the fast-food restaurant will say, hey \u2026 your device can connect to me and \u2026 the vehicle says, I see you \u2026\"",
      "By plotting the locations of the truck's digital handshakes and using other data from that night, authorities were able to establish a route Ackerman had traveled. It showed that over the course of the evening, he'd driven past the Key West Club, Haynie's house, Break on the Lake restaurant, and onto McClendon's street. Data also showed Ackerman's truck had been near the scene of the collision when it occurred.",
      "And that's not all. Womack told \"48 Hours\" the pickup also stored performance information, including measurements like speed and acceleration.",
      "\"It told you \u2026 speed, um, it told you the braking. Whenever he shifts the gears, when he opens the door, when he connects his phone, when he disconnects his phone \u2026 I mean, it tells you a lot of information.\"",
      "Experts would determine that seconds before the impact, Ackerman was driving about 25 miles per hour on the dark road. It was in his neighborhood, so it's likely he would have known it was a dead end. At precisely 1:11:33 a.m., the data showed a \"wheel slip,\" in which acceleration or braking caused the tires to lose contact with the road.",
      "\"\u2026 We could narrow it down to tenths of seconds when the collision occurred,\" Womack said, adding that data show seconds later, Ackerman's truck had stopped. \"\u2026 Bud's opening the door to his vehicle, um then \u2026 he shifts it to park.\"",
      "Womack said Ackerman then got out of the truck.",
      "\"\u2026 Then he gets back in and then it's shifted to drive,\" Womack continued, adding that minutes later, Ackerman's truck stops again and his phone disconnects from the vehicle's computer. \"That's when he got home and got out,\" Womack said.",
      "\"And took his phone with him?\" asked Green.",
      "\"And took his phone with him. That's correct,\" Womack replied.",
      "Bud Ackerman had been arrested within hours after the collision, but his attorney Jack Swerling says much of the authorities' narrative of that night is not correct.",
      "Swerling acknowledged Ackerman was unhappy his wife had begun dating before the divorce was final and even that Ackerman hit McClendon and his BMW that night. But he says his client was meeting with McClendon merely to speak with him. According to Swerling, McClendon was standing further out toward the center of the road than prosecutors contend. And it was too dark for Ackerman to see him before the last few moments. Swerling says hitting McClendon was an accident, in fact arguing Ackerman aimed for McClendon's empty car to stop the truck's forward momentum.",
      "\"\u2026 He's trying to avoid hitting him,\" Swerling said.",

      "Girone spent the last decade of her life in an assisted living facility in North Bellmore, on Long Island, New York, according to Patch, a local news outlet.",
      "Claims Conference, a New York-based organization whose full name is the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, said she\u00a0died Monday in New York.",
      "\"Rose was an example of fortitude, but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,\" Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice president, said in a statement Thursday. \"The lessons of the Holocaust must not die with those who endured the suffering.\"",
      "Girone was born on January 13, 1912, in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was 6, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.",
      "When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Hitler, she said: \"Hitler came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody.\"",
      "Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "\"This passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,\" Schneider said. \"The Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today's world, to be forgotten.\"",
      "Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.",
      "She was 9 months pregnant and living in Breslau, which is now Wroclaw, Poland, when Nazis arrived to take Mannheim to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Their family had two cars, so she asked her husband to leave his keys.",
      "She said she remembers one Nazi saying: \"Take that woman also.\"",
      "The other Nazi responded: \"She's pregnant, leave her alone.\"",
      "The next morning, her father-in-law was also taken and she was left alone with their housekeeper.",
      "After her daughter, Reha, was born in 1938, Girone was able to get Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband's release.",
      "In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only 6 months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.",
      "Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.",
      "But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three was forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bed bugs crawled through their belongings.",
      "Her father-in-law came just before World War II started but became sick and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself \"King of the Jews.\"",
      "\"They did really horrible things to people,\" Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. \"One of our friends got killed because he wouldn't move fast enough.\"",
      "Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors, as British radios were not allowed.",
      "When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone's mother, grandmother and other relatives in the U.S. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.",
      "They arrived in New York City in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.",
      "Girone was also reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his U.S. citizenship by joining the Army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was the first time they saw each other in 17 years.",
      "Girone later divorced Mannheim. In 1968, she met Jack Girone, the same day her granddaughter was born. By the next year, they were married. He died in 1990.",
      "When asked in 1996 for the message she would like to leave for her daughter and granddaughter, she said: \"Nothing is so very bad that something good shouldn't come out of it. No matter what it is.\"",
      "According to Patch, the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center (HMTC) said that, when asked in 2022 about her longevity, Girone said simply, \"Don't get upset over nonsense.\"",

      "A father of three sons serving his country",
      "Camarena, a father of three sons, was living in Guadalajara, Mexico, with his family working as an undercover DEA agent, his son told CBS News in a 2017 interview. He had been stationed there for four years on the trail of the country's biggest marijuana and cocaine traffickers.",
      "He had been with the DEA for 11 years after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, and as a fireman police, officer, and an Imperial County deputy sheriff in Calexico, California, where he grew up, according to the DEA. Camarena was born in Mexicali, Mexico, and moved to the U.S. when he was nine years old.",
      "He married his high-school sweetheart, and together with their young family, they moved to Mexico in 1981.",
      "At the time, Guadalajara  cartel leader Quintero was one of the primary suppliers of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana to the U.S. in the late 1970s. He blamed Camarena for a 1984 raid by Mexican authorities on a marijuana plantation, Rancho Bufalo, that upset his business.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Social Security Administration is offering payouts to employees who voluntarily resign from the federal agency, ahead of what they warn will be \"significant workforce reductions.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration is offering financial incentives ranging from $15,000 to $25,000 to employees who choose to voluntarily resign from the federal agency, ahead of what they warn will be \"significant workforce reductions.\"",
      "A message sent out to employees Thursday stated that the agency will soon implement restructuring that includes workforce cuts and \"massive reorganizations.\"",
      "The SSA said that wholesale \"abolishment of organizations and positions\" could happen, as well as reassignments and staff cuts.",
      "Earlier this week, the Office of Personnel Management advised agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" by March 13 and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "Thursday's message offers all Social Security employees three options ahead of the agency's expected cuts: voluntary reassignment \"to a mission critical position,\" voluntary early retirement, if eligible, or \"voluntary separation incentive payments,\" if eligible.",
      "Those who would take the voluntary separation incentive payment must opt in by March 14 and leave the agency no later than April 19. The option echoes the \"fork in the road\" or deferred resignation program from OPM, in which eligible federal employees could resign from their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The incentive payments offered the SSA is dependent on an employee's classification, or where they stand on the federal payscale. Those with a GS-8 or under would get $15,000, while those classified with GS-9 to GS-12 would receive $20,000. Those with a GS-13 or higher would receive $25,000.",
      "SSA notes that employees who opt in may be put on administrative leave through April 19 and must not have already opted into the buyout program offered by OPM earlier this year.",
      "Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS News they fear employees may opt in to get the separation payment, and that it could already strain the benefits agency she said is in need of more investment to shorten wait times and open more field offices, not cuts.",
      "\"If people don't take it, then they're going to be constantly looking over their shoulder, looking through their email waiting to see if they get fired,\" Altman said. \"It's going to add stress, chaos and uncertainty.\"",
      "Altman added that employees should first see if their severance pay from a potential termination could be more than what the SSA is offering for voluntarily resigning.",
      "Jill Hornick, a 33-year Social Security employee, noted that public-facing employees who work in field offices and handle claims at Social Security's 1-800 number were told by former acting SSA Commissioner Michelle King that they were exempt from OPM's buyout offer.",
      "\"[King] knew it would hurt public service\" if these hires were allowed to take the offer, said Hornick, who is also an administrative director at an Illinois local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, which nationally represents hundreds of thousands of federal workers. \"Because we're at a 25-year staffing low.\"",
      "Now that this separation incentive is available to them, Hornick said she has \"no doubt\" these frontline employees will take it, and warned that processing times for claims could \"go through the roof.\"",
      "\"I have been trying to reassure [these] employees to take a deep breath. They're terrified, scared to death they will not have a job tomorrow, and put a roof over their head. It's just been one thing after another this week,\" Hornick added.",
      "The incentive payments offer does not apply to probationary employees, who generally have less than a year on the job, and must have worked in the executive branch for at least three years.",
      "Those looking to retire early must opt in between March 1 and Dec. 31. To be eligible for early retirement, an employee must be at least 50 years old and have 20 years of \"creditable service,\" or have 25 years of creditable service at any age.",
      "The SSA has seen several changes in recent weeks. Acting SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek was appointed to the role after the previous commissioner, King, was resistant to allowing staff with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, get access to sensitive agency data.",
      "Earlier this week, two SSA offices were closed \u2014 the Office of Transformation and the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity \u2014 which resulted in 190 staffers being put on administrative leave.",

      "\"Just ceasefire will never work,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"25 times\" Putin \"broke his own signature,\" or violated his word on agreements.",
      "\"But he never broke to me,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "A White House official said that the Ukrainians \"have been difficult to negotiate with [for] quite some time,\" and the Oval Office argument was \"the tipping point.\" The minerals deal would have been a \"first step to a lasting peace,\" but Zelenskyy \"overplayed his cards.\"",
      "The meeting went so poorly that after it ended, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Zelenskyy on social media, saying he is \"not ready for peace.\"",
      "\"We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It's amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don't want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was spotted leaving the White House at 1:41 p.m.",
      "After his team was told to leave the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X: \"Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you\u00a0@POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was scheduled to speak at the Hudson Institute in Washington Friday afternoon, but according to event organizers, Zelenskyy's office informed them he would not be coming.",
      "As Mr. Trump left for his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida Friday afternoon, CBS News asked him what Zelensky needs to do in order for Mr. Trump to restart talks.",
      "\"He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace,'\" Mr. Trump said. \"He doesn't have to stand there and say about, 'Putin this, Putin that.' All negative things. He's gotta say, 'I wanna make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer.' His people are dying. He doesn't have the cards just so you understand it, okay?\"",
      "Administration sources on next steps",
      "High-level sources with the Trump administration told CBS News that Ukrainian officials reached out Friday afternoon to senior White House officials desperate to get the deal back on track. However, they were told that would not happen today. Mr. Trump was unwilling to talk to Zelenskyy further today, the sources said.",
      "When Rubio and Waltz went into the Roosevelt Room of the White House to ask Zelenskyy to leave, they made it clear that any further engagements Friday would be counterproductive, the sources said, adding that Waltz told Zelenskyy that he had made a tremendous mistake and a disservice to Ukraine and to the U.S.",
      "No phone calls between Mr. Trump and Putin have been scheduled, the sources added, while multiple European officials have called top Trump officials since Zelenskyy departed the White House asking how the minerals deal can be salvaged.",
      "Regarding Zelenskyy's request for military guarantees, the U.S. made it clear Mr. Trump wanted an economic partnership, and then they would talk about the guarantees as part of the ceasefire if it happened, the sources said. There was no discussion among Trump officials about putting U.S. boots on the ground.",
      "The sources said that the White House is uncertain if it can help facilitate an end to the fighting. Mr. Trump is not seeking regime change in Ukraine, the sources said, and there have been no discussions about who in Ukraine might be a better leader than Zelenskyy.",
      "What to know about Zelenskyy's White House visit",
      "Mr. Trump mentioned earlier this week that the U.S. had reached a deal with Zelenskyy on a broad framework for sharing Ukraine's\u00a0mineral resources, and that the Ukrainian leader was coming to the White House because he \"would like to sign it together with me.\" Negotiations over the minerals continued despite public tension between the two leaders in recent days. Mr. Trump appeared to blame Ukraine for the war Russia started and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\" while declining to say the same of Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "One Ukrainian official told CBS News Kyiv hopes the signing of the agreement would ensure the continued flow of security support that Ukraine needs. Mr. Trump said Thursday the deal would help pay back American taxpayers for supporting Ukraine over the past three years.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Zelenskyy wrote, \"Peace and security guarantees are the key to ensuring that Russia can no longer destroy the lives of other nations.\" He added, \"For me and for all of us in the world, it's important that U.S. support is not stopped. Strength is needed on the path to peace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Putin earlier this month and said the Russian leader wants an end to the war. Last week, the president said he trusts Russia to negotiate in good faith, as top Trump administration officials met with Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia without a Ukrainian representative. The president on Thursday said he believes Putin would comply with any peace agreement reached.",
      "\"I don't believe he's going to violate his word,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump last week called Zelenskyy a \"dictator,\"\u00a0referring to the fact that the Ukrainian leader's five-year term expired last year, and no new election has been held. Ukraine has been under martial law since soon after the war started in 2022, and the country's constitution bans elections during martial law. On Monday, during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr. Trump was asked whether he views Putin as a dictator, since he called Zelenskyy one.",
      "\"I don't use those words lightly, I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" he replied. \"Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has even cast blame on Kyiv for being invaded by Russia.",
      "\"You should have never started it, you could have made a deal,\" Mr. Trump said of Ukraine last week.",
      "Top Trump administration officials have also been reluctant to criticize Putin. National security adviser Mike Waltz didn't answer directly when a reporter asked him if Mr. Trump views Putin as a dictator. He also sidestepped a question about who bears more responsibility for the war, Russia or Ukraine.",
      "Referring to Mr. Trump, Waltz replied, \"His goal here is to bring this war to an end, period.\"",
      "The president frequently says the war never would have started if he had been president, rather than Joe Biden. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine before even taking office.",
      "\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Mr. Trump said at a June rally. \"I will get it settled before I even become president.\"",
      "But after winning the election, Mr. Trump suggested that reaching peace between Russia and Ukraine might be more difficult than forging peace in the Middle East.",
      "\"I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation,\" Mr. Trump said in December. \"I see that as more difficult.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Zelenskyy said he would give up the presidency if doing so would achieve lasting peace for Ukraine and membership in NATO.",
      "\"If to achieve peace, you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,\" Zelenskyy said at a forum marking the three-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.",

      "The World Health Organization's head of emergencies, Mike Ryan, said Friday that more than 60 unexplained deaths in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo were likely due to \"some kind of poisoning event,\" adding that local authorities had indicated to the WHO \"a very strong level of suspicion of a poisoning event\" related to a water source in the hardest-hit village.",
      "It \"appears very much more like a toxic type event, either from a biologic perspective like meningitis or from chemical exposure,\" Ryan said during a scheduled online news conference focused on flu prevention.",
      "Ryan said the WHO investigation was still ongoing, with a focus on protecting the vulnerable population of the Congo, and he lamented that global interest was likely to wane quickly if it became clear that this is \"not some major new Earth-killing virus.\"",
      "Ryan commended health workers in the country for carrying out their efforts amid a number of challenges.",

      "Concern over front-line impact of Trump's aid cuts",
      "When a number of unexplained cases of illness crop up, a team of health officials and international \"virus hunters\" immediately go in to investigate the outbreak, determine who was the first case \u2014 \"patient zero\" \u2014 and work to identify, contain and treat the illness.",

      "One U.S. health official who spoke with CBS News disputed that aid had been restored, however. They said locally trained health workers in some of the infectious disease hot zones in Africa have not been paid, and some have been dismissed entirely due to the USAID cuts.",
      "The U.S. has long been the largest international donor to Congo's health sector, and the funding has helped train epidemiologists to do the fieldwork that identifies and controls disease outbreaks. It's unclear how President Trump's funding cuts will affect the teams on the ground, but there's widespread concern among health officials, with one virus hunter telling CBS News the region is facing \"a perfect storm\" for the potential spread of infectious diseases, including possible new ones.",

      "In northern Congo, health officials have been searching for anyone with general sickness or an illness that fits a \"broad case definition\" that includes fever, chills, headache, nose bleeding, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, stiff neck and muscle or joint pain",
      "By February 19, the WHO said 943 people with such symptoms had been identified, including 52 who had died.",
      "Test results released on February 13 showed the first cases were not Ebola or Marburg, but half of the samples did test positive for malaria. Earlier samples of suspected cases, health officials say, were \"not viable,\" so retesting delayed the diagnostic process. WHO officials are conducting further tests, also looking at the possibility of meningitis and testing food, water and other environmental samples from the affected region.",
      "Officials say they're searching for unusual patterns in cases of the mystery illness by increasing both disease surveillance and treatment for other diseases such as malaria, meningitis and typhoid fever.",
      "A regional health team arrived in the Basankkusu health zone, which is about 110 miles from the Bolamba zone, on February 16, and it was joined six days later by a national rapid response team from the Ministry of Health and two WHO epidemiologists. They have been collecting samples of blood and urine and taking oral and nasal swabs for testing in an effort to identify the illness.",
      "\"These illnesses know no boundaries.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has rolled back constraints on American commanders to authorize airstrikes and special operation raids outside conventional battlefields, broadening the range of people who can be targeted, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the policy shift.",
      "The quiet but seismic recalibration dismantles Biden-era mandates and signals a return to more aggressive counterterrorism policies Trump first instituted in his first term.",
      "During his first overseas trip earlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in a meeting with senior U.S. military leaders from U.S. Africa Command in Germany, signed a directive easing policy constraints and executive oversight on airstrikes and the deployment of American commandos.",
      "The move prioritizes flexibility by giving commanders greater latitude to decide whom to target while relaxing the multi-layered centralized control former President Joe Biden implemented over airstrikes and raids by American special operation forces, U.S. officials told CBS News on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about national security matters.",
      "One senior Defense Department official told CBS News that Biden's warfare policies were carbon copies of those established during former President Barack Obama's second term. During Biden's tenure, airstrikes typically focused on the senior leadership of terrorist organizations.",
      "The official added that Mr. Trump's approach carries both risks and rewards because the streamlined process can potentially degrade foreign terrorist organizations capabilities faster, given the lower threshold required to strike and widened target selection, but it inherently raises the risk of flawed decisions and unintended civilian casualties.",
      "The Islamist armed group Al-Shabaab in Somalia and the Houthis in Yemen were discussed as potential targets, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the meeting. It's not clear if the other U.S. combatant commands around the world were also given the same directive.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Africa Command on Tuesday, but has not received a reply. On Friday, Hegseth confirmed the reporting\u00a0in a post on X, sharing CBS News' story with the message, \"Correct.\"",
      "American military airstrikes fall into two broad categories \u2014 deliberate and defensive, according to U.S. Africa Command's website. Deliberate strikes adhere to a multi-layered process of regulations and high-level vetting, which under the Biden administration ran through the Joint Staff and the executive branch.",
      "Throughout the deliberate strike process, military lawyers review the compiled intelligence to determine if individuals are legal combatants under the law of armed conflict, to reduce the risk of civilian casualties and avoid targeted killings of innocent people mistaken for terrorist suspects.",
      "Defensive airstrikes are used \"in limited circumstances where U.S. or specifically designated partner forces are in imminent danger from hostile forces,\" according to U.S. Africa Commands website. These types of airstrikes are typically authorized by the combatant command, and the executive branch does not need to approve these strikes.",
      "A leaked classified study from 2013, obtained by The Intercept, details how the U.S. government authorized drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia between 2011 and 2012 following presidential approval during the Obama administration \u2014 policies similarly implemented under Biden.",
      "Before launching a strike, military commanders had to ensure it met a number of strict criteria and obtain approvals from seven decision makers \u2014 including the president.\u00a0 The individual targeted had to be confirmed as a member of an approved terrorist organization using two independent forms of intelligence. Civilian casualties had to be projected as minimal. And there could be no \"contradictory intelligence\" muddying the waters.",
      "The process became a high-stakes roundtable. The task force that assembled the target package, the combatant commander, the CIA chief of mission, and the host nation all had to sign off on the airstrike. A single dissent along the way meant the operation would be halted.",
      "It's not clear if these same provisions are included in the new directive. However, they did exist during Mr. Trump's first term, with some exceptions on approval by the host nation in countries such as Afghanistan.",

      "Mexico has sent drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who is wanted for the notorious killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985, to the United States with 28 other prisoners requested by the U.S. government, the Justice Department confirmed Thursday evening.",
      "\"The defendants taken into U.S. custody today include leaders and managers of drug cartels recently designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. It said they are facing charges including racketeering, drug-trafficking, murder, illegal use of firearms, money laundering and other crimes.",
      "The Mexican government said in a\u00a0statement, \"They were wanted for their links to criminal organizations for drug trafficking, among other crimes.\" Mexico said the transfers were carried out \"under institutional protocols with due respect for their fundamental rights.\"",
      "Also on the list were two leaders of the Los Zetas cartel, Mexicans Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales and his brother Omar Trevi\u00f1o Morales, known as Z-40 and Z-42.",
      "The removal of the drug lords from Mexico coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexico's Foreign Minister Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente and other top economic and military officials. The meeting was the latest in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. over trade and security relations, which have radically shifted since President Trump took office.",
      "\"As President Trump has made clear, cartels are terrorist groups, and this Department of Justice is devoted to destroying cartels and transnational gangs,\"Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.",
      "DEA Acting Administrator Derek S. Maltz described Caro Quintero as \"a cartel kingpin who unleashed violence, destruction, and death across the United States and Mexico\" and called his transfer \"extremely personal for the men and women of DEA\" due to Caro Quintero's role in the brutal 1985 kidnapping and killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena.",
      "The attack marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico relations. Caro Quintero walked free in 2013 after 28 years in prison when a court overturned his 40-year sentence for Camarena's murder. He spent years on the FBI and DEA's most wanted lists.",
      "Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara cartel, had since returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the northern Mexico border state of Sonora until he was arrested by Mexican forces in 2022.",
      "In January, a nonprofit group representing the Camarena family sent a letter to the White House urging the Trump administration to renew longstanding U.S. requests for Mexico to extradite Caro Quintero, according to a copy of the letter provided to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the family's outreach.",
      "\"His return to the U.S. would give the family much needed closure and serve the best interests of justice,\" the letter states.",
      "The U.S. had sought the extradition of Caro Quintero shortly after his arrest in 2022. But the request remained stuck at Mexico's foreign ministry for unknown reasons as Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor,\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador, severely curtailed Mexican cooperation with DEA to protest undercover U.S. law enforcement operations in Mexico targeting senior political and military officials.",
      "\"If he's being sent to the U.S. outside of a formal extradition, and if Mexico didn't place any restrictions, then he can be prosecuted for whatever the U.S. wants,\" according to Bonnie Klapper, a former federal narcotics prosecutor in Brooklyn who is familiar with the case.",
      "The removal of the Trevi\u00f1o Morales brothers also marks the end of a long process that began after the capture in 2013 of Miguel Trevi\u00f1o Morales and, two years later, of his brother, Omar. The process wound on for so many years that then-Mexico's Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, described the lags as \"truly shameful\".",
      "The Trevi\u00f1o Morales family, who American authorities have accused of running the violent northeastern Cartel from prison, have charges pending in the US for participation in a criminal organization, drug trafficking, firearms offenses and money laundering.",
      "The 29 prisoners, who had been held in various prisons across Mexico, were being transferred to several cities across the U.S. on Thursday, including Chicago; Houston; McKinney, Texas; New York City; Phoenix; San Antonio; Washington, D.C. and White Plains, New York, officials said.",
      "The Mexican government released mug shots of the 29 men, with parts of their faces hidden behind black bars.",
      "The transfer comes as top Mexican officials are in Washington, D.C., trying to head off the Trump administration's threat of\u00a0imposing 25% tariffs on all Mexican imports\u00a0next week.",
      "Mr. Trump said Thursday that he intends to move forward with the sanctions, writing on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0that \"drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels.\"",
      "In exchange for delaying tariffs, Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on the U.S.-Mexico\u00a0border, cartels and fentanyl production, despite significant dips in migration and overdoses over the past year. The removals may indicate that negotiations are moving along as the tariff deadline approaches.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kurdish-pkk-abdullah-ocalan-terrorist-group-disarm-us-trump-reax/",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 08:28:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The PKK's decades-long Kurdish insurgency in Turkey has killed tens of thousands of people. Now its long-time leader says it's time to end the fight.",
    "story": [
      "Istanbul \u2014 In a historic move, imprisoned Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan called Thursday on members of the banned Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) to lay down their weapons to end a decades-long conflict with Turkey's government that has killed tens of thousands of people and complicated U.S. relations with the NATO ally.",
      "The PKK is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., along with the European Union, NATO and many other nations. Ocalan's call for disarmament, if acted on by the PKK, is likely to have far-reaching implications for the entire Middle East, including for millions of ethnic Kurds living in Syria, Iraq and Iran.",
      "\"I am making a call for the laying down of arms and I take on the historical responsibility for this call,\" Ocalan said in a letter read out by Kurdish politicians in Istanbul. \"All groups must lay down their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself.\"",
      "The PKK was established by Ocalan in 1978, initially seeking full independence and statehood for Turkey's large Kurdish minority, but later asking for autonomy. Since then, as many as 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of others displaced from their homes by the simmering conflict between the group and Turkish state forces. The PKK has carried out several major terrorist attacks in Turkey, killing scores of security forces but also civilians in Istanbul and Ankara.",
      "Ocalan was arrested in 1999 and is serving a life sentence in a prison in northwest Turkey, but he's still seen as the movement's ideological leader. The reading of his letter was broadcast on screens set up in majority Kurdish cities in the southeast of Turkey, where it was cheered by crowds hopeful for peace.",
      "\"There is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realization of a political system. Democratic consensus is the fundamental way,\" Ocalan said in his statement.",
      "There was no immediate statement from the PKK's leadership on Ocalan's letter, but his call to disarm had been anticipated, and in a statement published by the group on February 12, the PKK hailed the move and said it would begin, \"a process of change, transformation and restructuring.\"",
      "U.S. hopes announcement will \"bring peace to this troubled region\"",
      "As a NATO member, Turkey is a strategic ally of the U.S., and it has played a particularly vital role, given its location at the junction of Asia and the Middle East, in counterterrorism efforts and promoting Mideast stability.",
      "Close U.S. military cooperation with another Kurdish armed group based in neighboring Syria, the YPG, against ISIS during Syria's civil war, caused serious friction with Ankara. Turkey has long argued that the YPG is an extension of the PKK, and that American support for the Kurdish forces was therefor an indirect endorsement of and support for the PKK.",
      "The Trump administration welcomed Ocalan's call, with U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes telling CNN on Thursday that it was, \"a significant development and we hope that it will help assuage our Turkish allies about U.S. counter-ISIS partners in northeast Syria. We believe it will help bring peace to this troubled region.\"",
      "Berkay Mandiraci, senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group think tank, told CBS News a peace deal between the Turkish government and the PKK could \"remove this long-standing thorn in bilateral ties,\" and it could bring with it \"a host of dividends for Turkey.\"",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also expressed support for Ocalan's disarmament call, with his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric telling reporters on Thursday that it was an \"important development\" that offered \"a glimmer of hope that could lead to a resolution of the long-standing conflict.\"",
      "Mandiraci told CBS News an agreement between Ankara and the PKK could also help bring stability to Syria.",
      "A new Syrian government, led by former Islamic extremist rebels who've disavowed militancy and publicly embraced secularism, is trying to assert itself and gain international support.",
      "Mandiraci said a peace deal with the PKK in Turkey could bolster ongoing talks between the Kurdish forces that were backed by the U.S. and Syria's interim government, aimed at integrating the Kurdish-controlled northeast region of Syria with the Syrian state.",
      "Why would the PKK disarm now?",
      "\"After a decade of intensive fighting, the PKK seems to be weakened,\" Mandiraci told CBS News, assessing the timing of Ocalan's call. \"The Turkish military drove the group out of Turkey's southeast and pressed it deep into the steep and unforgiving mountains of northern Iraq.\"",
      "So far, however, no information has been shared publicly regarding the details of any negotiations that led to Ocalan's call, nor how the process of disarming the group might actually work. The Turkish government has said nothing about what it might offer the PKK in exchange for disarmament.",
      "Ocalan's statement comes as the Turkish government faces accusations of a crackdown on dissent. Since local elections were held across the country in March 2024, more than 10 elected mayors have been removed from their posts and replaced by government appointees, mostly in Kurdish-majority cities.",
      "So far, Ocalan's call has drawn a muted response from Turkish officials. Efkan Ala, the deputy chairman of the ruling Justice and Development Party, said the government was focused on the outcome, not the statement.",
      "\"The essence of the call is the laying down of arms and the dissolution of the terrorist organization,\" Ala said. \"We will look at the outcome. Of course, as Turkey, we will see whether this outcome will materialize.\"",
      "A similar attempt to end the fighting more than a decade ago failed, after a ceasefire that lasted two years collapsed in 2015, engulfing Turkish forces in a bloody conflict with the PKK.",

      "After the war, his aggressive style of play without fear of sacrifice was noticed by his peers and encouraged by the state, which provided him with a scholarship and a coach.",
      "Having made a strong impression, he found himself in the shadow of another rising figure in Soviet chess, Mikhail Tal, the so-called \"Magician of Riga\".",
      "It was not until 1961 that Spassky made a remarkable comeback by winning the USSR Championship.",
      "Eight years later he defeated his compatriot Tigran Petrosian to take the world title.",
      "\"I never set myself the goal of becoming world champion. Everything worked out by itself. I was progressing in leaps and bounds,\" Spassky said in 2016.",
      "Yugoslav grandmaster Svetozar Gligoric said that Spassky's secret strength \"lay in his colossal skill in adapting himself to the different styles of his opponents,\" the Washington Post reported.",
      "\"Colossal responsibility\"",
      "But Spassky would keep his title for just three years.",
      "In 1972 in Iceland he played the match that would define his career, against the American prodigy Fischer.",
      "With the Cold War at its height and the Soviet Union having dominated the game for years, Spassky faced a must-win situation in his match-up with the eccentric 29-year-old, who openly criticised Soviet chess players.",
      "But after a comfortable start for Spassky, the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948.",
      "Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, for Spassky it was a relief to be rid of a \"colossal responsibility.\"",
      "\"You can't imagine how relieved I was when Fischer took the title away from me. I freed myself from a very heavy burden and breathed freely,\" he said nearly four decades later.",
      "The iconic Cold War duel has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired the Walter Tevis novel \"The Queen's Gambit,\" which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020.",
      "But at the time, in the wake of his defeat, Spassky fell out of favour.",
      "Four years later, in 1976, he moved to France, after marrying a Frenchwoman of Russian origin. He obtained French citizenship in 1978.",
      "Spassky did not return to the public sphere for years, until he played an unofficial rematch against Fischer in Yugoslavia in 1992.",
      "The last years of his life were marked by ill health and a mysterious family conflict.",
      "After two strokes, he returned to Russia in 2012 with the help of a sponsor and against the advice of his wife and sister.",
      "\"I have to start over from scratch, but I'm not afraid,\" Spassky said on Russian television after his return.",
      "A few years earlier, in 2008, he had visited the grave of his former rival Fischer, who died that year and was buried in a small cemetery in Iceland.",
      "\"Do you think that the neighboring spot is available?\" Spassky asked journalists accompanying him on the visit.",
      "Spassky lived in Moscow and his relatives informed the chess federation of his death, its executive director Alexander Tkachev told RIA Novosti news agency.",

    "summary": "Law enforcement agencies from Australia to Canada helped detain dozens of suspects linked to a Denmark-based AI child sex abuse platform, Europol says.",
    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",
      "\"This is an industry-wide challenge, and we're continually working to improve our detection and enforcement technology,\" Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News in a statement sent by email at the time.",

      "Headed to a luncheon with his wife, Mika, on Feb. 7, 1985, Camarena, then 37 years old, was surrounded by five armed men who threw him into a car and sped away, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. He had been due to transfer back to the U.S. just three weeks later, the DEA said.",
      "About a month after he disappeared, his body was found on a ranch about 60 miles away, according to the DEA. He had been tortured.",
      "Nearly four decades later, his alleged killer, drug lord\u00a0Rafael Caro Quintero, is headed to the U.S. along with 28 other prisoners\u00a0requested by the U.S. government, the Justice Department confirmed Thursday evening.",
      "\"This moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA who believe Caro Quintero is responsible for the brutal torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena.

      "A father of three sons serving his country",
      "Camarena, a father of three sons, was living in Guadalajara, Mexico, with his family working as an undercover DEA agent, his son told CBS News in a 2017 interview. He had been stationed there for four years on the trail of the country's biggest marijuana and cocaine traffickers.",
      "He had been with the DEA for 11 years after serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, and as a fireman police, officer, and an Imperial County deputy sheriff in Calexico, California, where he grew up, according to the DEA. Camarena was born in Mexicali, Mexico, and moved to the U.S. when he was nine years old.",
      "He married his high-school sweetheart, and together with their young family, they moved to Mexico in 1981.",
      "At the time, Guadalajara  cartel leader Quintero was one of the primary suppliers of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana to the U.S. in the late 1970s. He blamed Camarena for a 1984 raid by Mexican authorities on a marijuana plantation, Rancho Bufalo, that upset his business.",
      "The DEA said at the time it was the largest drug seizure ever.",
      "In retaliation, it is believed Camarena was kidnapped in Guadalajara, allegedly on orders from Caro Quintero.",
      "Camarena's son, who shares the same name as his father, Enrique, was 11 years old when his dad disappeared. He remembered a few hours after he went missing, agents flooded their family home.",
      "\"Within about five or six hours, there's a dozen to two dozen agents that arrived,\" Enrique told CBS News in that 2017 interview. But he believed his father would return home.",
      "\"Well your dad's Superman,\" Enrique said. \"So, you think, we'll see him. He'll be fine.\"",
      "Enrique and his brothers were then rushed out of Mexico to the U.S. He remembers an agent picking him up and carrying him from his living room to a waiting car. He would never see his father again.",

      "In 1985, club members presented the \"Camarena Club Proclamation\" to then-first lady Nancy Reagan, bringing it to national attention. In 1988, Congress formally established Red Ribbon Week, which encourages parents, educators and businesses to promote a drug-free lifestyle. The Enrique S. Camarena Educational Foundation was later launched, which provides scholarships to high school seniors.",

    "story": [
      "During a news conference with President Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that his country is ready to put \"boots on the ground\" to support a peace deal in Ukraine as Starmer said they had a \"very good and productive visit.\"",
      "Achieving lasting peace in Ukraine and ending Russia's full-scale invasion was top of the agenda for Starmer and Mr. Trump in Starmer's first visit to the White House since Mr. Trump took office, as Mr. Trump said Thursday that he trusts Russian President Vladimir Putin to keep his word on any peace agreement they reach.",
      "\"We discussed a plan today to reach a peace that is tough and fair, that Ukraine will help shape, that's backed by strength, to stop Putin coming back for more,\" Starmer said. \"I'm working closely with other European leaders on this, and I'm clear that the U.K. is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working together with our allies, because that is the only way that peace will last.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called Starmer a \"very tough negotiator.\" Starmer, for his part, called his visit a \"very good and very productive\" one, noting Mr. Trump's family roots in Scotland.",
      "The conciliatory words were in contrast to larger disagreements they have had, especially on the war in Ukraine. Mr. Trump has broken with many European allies and has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Starmer said the two are working to end the \"barbaric\" war in Ukraine, acknowledging what Mr. Trump and his top administration officials have largely ignored \u2014 that Russia is the aggressor.",
      "\"It can't be peace that awards the aggressor,\" Starmer said, adding, \"we agree history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader.\"",
      "But in what is likely a concession to Mr. Trump, Starmer said the U.K. will be giving more aid to Ukraine this year than it has in any other year in the past, and will be increasing its defense spending as a part of its gross domestic product, also known as GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump said he thinks progress is being made on ending the Russia-Ukraine war, and that an agreement will \"either be fairly soon or it won't be at all.\"",
      "Starmer said the U.S. and U.K. will be working together on a lasting peace agreement in Ukraine.",
      "The U.K. prime minister also said the two administrations will work on reaching an economic deal between the two countries. Mr. Trump said Starmer tried very hard to persuade him not to impose tariffs on imports from the U.K.",
      "\"He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,\" Mr. Trump said of Starmer.",
      "Mr. Trump said there is a \"great chance\" they could reach a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary.\"",
      "Trump accepts invitation to visit U.K. in the \"near future\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Thursday he'll visit the United Kingdom in the \"near future\" and accepted an invitation for a state visit from King Charles.",
      "\"It's a great honor to have Prime Minister Starmer in the Oval Office,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's a very special place and he's a special man. And the United Kingdom is a \u2014 is a wonderful, this is a wonderful country that I know very well. I'm there a lot. And I'll be going, I'll be going there and we expect to see each other in the near future. We'll be announcing it.\" Both leaders emphasized the \"special relationship\" between the two countries, forged during World War II.",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Starmer would discuss Russia and Ukraine, as the president seeks an end to the war started when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In a break with many European allies \u2014 including Britain \u2014 Mr. Trump has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" but has declined to give the same label to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"Did I say that?\" Mr. Trump said, asked to repeat his characterization of Zelenskyy. \"I can't believe I said that. Next question.\"",
      "Starmer thanked Mr. Trump for changing the conversation on Ukraine, according to reporters in the room, and said he believes an \"historic deal\" can be achieved.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, disagreed with a previous assessment by Starmer that there is a risk Putin could invade Ukraine again after a deal is reached, saying he trusts Putin to keep his word.",
      "\"No. I don't think so,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think when we have a deal, it's going to be the deal.\"",
      "\"I think he'll keep his word,\" Mr. Trump said, calling it a \"trust and verify\" situation.",
      "\"We had to go through the Russian hoax together, that was not a good thing,\" Mr. Trump said, adding he's known Putin for a long time.",
      "Mr. Trump said they'll see if there are parts of Ukraine taken by Russia that could be given back to Ukraine, although he didn't specify where.",
      "\"There are a lot of areas that were taken,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Yeah, we've talked about it. A lot of the sea line has been taken. And we'll be talking about that. And we're going to see if we can get it back, or get a lot of it back for Ukraine, if that's possible.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two will also be discussing trade, as he imposes new tariffs on allies and adversaries alike.",
      "Starmer said ahead of the meeting that the U.S. and Britain \"want to strike a new partnership. We share the view that our best days lie ahead.\"",
      "\"Taking out a chainsaw isn't quite my style, but we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy,\" he said, at once taking a gentle jab at Musk while also attempting to appeal to Mr. Trump's passion for a slimmed down government. \"We are reforming, permitting, getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth, and we're open for business, open for investment, and we're determined to help U.S. innovators thrive in the United Kingdom.\"",
      "Starmer presented the president with a letter from King Charles, and Mr. Trump read it in real time. Mr. Trump called the British king a \"beautiful man and a wonderful man.\"",
      "Britain, the U.S., and collective security via NATO",
      "Starmer didn't arrive in Washington empty-handed. He flew in on the wings of an announcement just days earlier that his government was planning to bump U.K. defense spending from the current 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027, which his office has billed as Britain's biggest sustained defense spending increase since the Cold War. Starmer has left open the possibility of that defense spending rising further, to 3%, after the next U.K. general election.",
      "The timing of the prime minister's announcement was notable, coming just two days before his meeting with Mr. Trump. A White House official said ahead of the meeting that the Trump administration was \"very pleased\" with Starmer's announcement, but that it still wants to see America's NATO allies increase defense spending further, towards 5% of their respective national GDPs. That would be more, proportionally, than even the U.S. spends on defense, which in 2023 amounted to roughly 3.4% of the United States' GDP.",
      "Mr. Trump has implied that the U.S. could break from the historic collective defense agreement of NATO, known as Article 5, which essentially says that if any member is attacked it will be treated as an attack on all, if other member countries do not boost their defense spending.",
      "\"I think that that means there's got to be security guarantees,\" said Starmer, acknowledging the pressure for higher spending, but also indicating that he will ask the White House to provide clear commitments to help defend Ukraine against any future Russian attack if a ceasefire is reached to halt the ongoing war. \"I've indicated that we will play our full part. There has to be U.S. backing, because otherwise I don't think it will deter Putin. We are working on that. I'm having extensive discussions about it.\"",
      "A White House official said the U.S. appreciated Starmer's willingness to consider sending British troops to help with peacekeeping efforts to enforce a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but Mr. Trump has made it clear that any and all security guarantees for Ukraine may have to come from Europe.",
      "\"I'm not going to make security guarantees beyond, very much,\" Mr. Trump said this week. \"We're going to have Europe do that, because we're talking about, Europe is their nextdoor neighbor, but we're going to make sure everything goes well.\"",
      "U.S.-British trade",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff threats were also the agenda during Thursday's White House meeting. A 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. is set to kick in on March 12, ordered by Mr. Trump, he said, to protect American companies. Starmer may seek an exemption.",
      "Mr. Trump implied weeks ago that a unilateral trade agreement could be worked with the U.K. If that does not happen, there's concern that some of the estimated 40,000 British jobs directly linked to steel and aluminum production could be lost and entire plants could close.",
      "After Starmer's meeting with Mr. Trump, he's scheduled to meet back in London with several European leaders on Sunday, including the heads of state from Germany, Italy and Poland. Starmer will no doubt brief them on his talks with the U.S. president.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may join them, after he meets with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday, where he's expected to sign a financial deal to share his country's mineral wealth with Washington, which Mr. Trump has called \"payback\" for U.S. aid to Ukraine over the past three years.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 16:36:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The findings could pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.",
    "story": [
      "An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest terrorist attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group's intentions and underestimated its capabilities.",
      "\"A large-scale, surprise attack was not considered to be a likely scenario, due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the enemy,\" the military said in a summary of the findings, which were released Thursday. \"The IDF and intelligence agencies perceived Hamas as a limited and reactive threat and assumed that an early warning would precede any large-scale offensive.\"",
      "The findings could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the terrorist attack, which triggered the war in Gaza.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility for Israel's strategy in the years leading up to the attack, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire. Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military's main findings were that the region's most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas' intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "In comments made to military commanders Monday, and shared with the media on Thursday, the army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said he took responsibility for the army's failures.",
      "\"I was the commander of the military on October 7th, and I have my own responsibility. I also carry the weight of all your responsibility \u2014 that, too, I see as mine,\" said Halevi, who announced his resignation in January and is set to step down next week.",
      "The military's findings are in line with past conclusions reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\"Oct. 7 was a complete failure,\" one military official told The Associated Press who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found.",
      "The military also misjudged the capabilities of Hamas, long designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israeli governments. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the military official told the AP. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official told the AP.",
      "The official also said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision-makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack.",
      "\"The belief was that Hamas could be influenced through pressures that would reduce its motivation for war, primarily by improving living conditions in the Gaza Strip,\" the summary of the report said. \"Israel's policy towards Gaza was based on defense, stabilization and efforts to prevent Hamas' military buildup, readiness for short periods (i.e. days) of direct conflict, and preparation for a scenario of escalation.\"",
      "The Israeli military official told the AP that intelligence shows that Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had started planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military's command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a music festival with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official told the AP. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",

    "story": [
      "Weeks after a mass rape trial involving a man who drugged his wife and brought strangers home to assault her, France is again reeling as a new alleged predator appears in court.",
      "A trial is underway in Vannes, France, of 74-year-old Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of them children who were his patients. It is the biggest trial related to alleged child sex abuse in France \u2013 and one of the biggest in the world.",
      "His ex-wife, Marie-France Le Scouarnec, took the stand on Wednesday \u2013 and denied she had any knowledge of her husband's activities. \"There was nothing that could have made me think that. Nothing,\" she told the court.",
      "\"I never had an inkling. It's so huge, so unthinkable, inconceivable that my husband could have done all that,\" she said.",
      "The alleged assaults took place over 25 years, between 1989 and 2014, according to the prosecution. The average age of the children \u2014 both girls and boys \u2014 was 11.",
      "The prosecution claims many of the victims were still under anesthesia or just coming out of it when they were assaulted. Others were barely awake in their hospital beds as the surgeon allegedly assaulted them as he made his early morning rounds.",
      "On the first day of the trial, which started on Monday, Le Scouarnec told the court he had \"committed heinous acts.\" His lawyer said he admitted to carrying out \"the vast majority\" of the assaults of which he is accused.",
      "\"I owe it to all these people and their loved ones to take responsibility for my actions and the consequences they may have had,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.",
      "The alleged abuse of Le Scouarnec's former patients only came to light in 2017, after his neighbors' 6-year-old daughter told her parents he had exposed himself and touched her through the fence that divided their gardens.",
      "During a search of his home, police said they discovered hard drives containing more than 300,000 photos and videos depicting child sex abuse. They also found notebooks with meticulous records of the alleged abuse of child patients.",
      "That investigation led to his conviction in December 2020 for the sexual abuse of four little girls: the young neighbor, a 4-year-old patient and two of his nieces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "On Thursday, the former surgeon's sister, the mother of the two nieces, took the stand \u2014 and accused his ex-wife of \"cruelty\" and \"lies.\" The woman, Annie, whose last name was not made public at the trial, said Marie-France Le Scouarnec knew that her husband abused his nieces, which Marie-France Le Scouarnec had denied in court.",
      "Annie said the youngest of her two daughters confided in her in October 2000 that Le Scouarnec had sexually abused her. She told the court that her brother admitted the assault to her, and said that his wife was aware of what had happened.",
      "In 2005, Le Scouarnec was convicted of possession of child sexual abuse images, after an FBI investigation into an international network. He was given a four-year suspended sentence. The court did not order any psychological followup or restriction on his work.",
      "Le Scouarnec told investigators that even though he told his employers at a hospital in Quimperl\u00e9 about the conviction, no particular measures were taken.",
      "During his career, Le Scouarnec worked in a number of hospitals across Brittany, a region in western France where his trial is being held. That has led many to question how he could have carried out so many alleged rapes and assaults without an alarm being raised.",
      "Investigators said that few of the victims had any memory of the alleged assaults. For many of them, it came as a complete shock when police contacted them with evidence of what had happened, as recounted in the surgeon's journals.",
      "Outside the courthouse Monday, a small group of protesters brandished placards denouncing \"more than 20 years of silence\" about the surgeon's past.",
      "The trial is set to last four months. During that time, the 299 alleged victims \u2014 who are now men and women \u2014 will be called on to recount what they can remember of their interactions with Le Scouarnec, who faces 20 years in prison if convicted.",

      "\"Young satyrs with pointed ears play the double flute, while another performs a sacrifice of wine in acrobatic style, squirting wine behind him from a drinking horn into a patera (shallow bowl),\"\u00a0Pompeii said in a statement, while releasing several images of the discoveries.",

      "The frieze is painted in the Second Style of Pompeian painting, which is known for its addition of architectural details like pillars. It dates from about 40 to 30 B.C., making it over 100 years old by the time of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 that destroyed the city.",
      "A woman at the center of the frieze \"is about to be initiated into the mysteries of Dionysus, the god who dies and is reborn and who promises the same destiny to his followers,\" it said.",
      "These initiation rituals, required in antiquity to join such cults, often promised \"a new blissful life, both in this world and in the afterlife.\"",
      "Hunting figures prominently in the rite depicted in the frieze, with another smaller frieze above the principal one depicting animals, alive and dead, a gutted wild boar, various birds, and fish.",
      "\"It is an exceptional historical document,\" said Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli.",
      "Its discovery makes Pompeii \"an extraordinary testimony to an aspect of life in classical Mediterranean life that is largely unknown,\" he said.",
      "When Vesuvius erupted, the spouting ash and rock helped preserve many of Pompeii's buildings almost in their original state.",

      "Last month, archeologists at the site unearthed a private bathhouse built over 2,000 years ago. Scientists working in the same area recently found a bakery, a laundry shop, two villas and the bones of three people\u00a0who died during the volcanic eruption, which destroyed both the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",
      "Last October, archaeologists in Pompeii unearthed a rare tiny home and elaborate frescoes while excavating the site. A few months before that, excavators discovered the remains of two more victims of the eruption, along with a trove of gold treasures.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday that he had instructed his country's negotiators to travel to Cairo \"for the continuation of the talks\" aimed at keeping the\u00a0tenuous ceasefire agreement with Hamas alive. The announcement came hours after four Israeli hostages'\u00a0remains were returned by Hamas\u00a0as part of the final hostage-prisoner exchange of phase one of the deal.",
      "The fact that the Israeli leader was sending his team to Cairo would bring hope, but there was still deep uncertainty over the future of the ceasefire deal two days before its first six-week phase ends.",
      "The bodies handed over by Hamas on Thursday were the last of the 33 hostages to be returned to Israel during phase one of the ceasefire. Israel released about 600 more Palestinian prisoners Thursday in exchange. The freed detainees, some of whom had been serving long sentences and others who were detained during the Gaza war and never formally charged, poured out of buses in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza to emotional reunions with loved ones.",
      "There were still 59 Israeli hostages being held in Gaza as of Thursday, only 24 of whom are believed to be alive, according to the Israeli government. Their fate hinges on the future of the ceasefire agreement that was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The plan was for the second phase of the deal to see all remaining hostages returned in exchange for a permanent ceasefire and Israel pulling its forces out of Gaza. But Netanyahu has been under intense pressure from hardline members of his cabinet to walk away from the truce and resume Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Israel and the European Union.",

      "Israeli West Bank assault displaces more than 40,000 Palestinians as Gaza truce hangs in balance",
      "Netanyahu has said for more than a year that the objective of the war in Gaza \u2014 which the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry says has killed well over 48,000 people, most of them civilians \u2014 is to destroy or at least disarm Hamas. That's a goal Israel's devastating military assault has not yet achieved.",
      "The Israeli prime minister is also under intense pressure, however, from the families of the hostages to keep the ceasefire alive so their loved ones can be brought back home. President Trump has made it clear that he will back Israel, whatever Netanyahu decides to do, but his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff is expected back in the region soon to push for a second phase.",
      "\"We will get to stage two, or phase two, and I'm very focused on that, and I think it's going to happen,\" Witkoff said Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Witkoff said securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages, Edan Alexander, who was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the October 7 terrorist attack, was \"front and center for us.\"",
      "\"I know his parents. We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe,\" Witkoff told Brennan.",
      "Getting to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement, and the terms negotiated for it, is also critical for Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinian residents, the vast majority of whom were forced to flee from their homes by the 15-month war, many of them multiple times. Many have returned to find their cities and towns in ruins, and Mr. Trump's suggestion that they all be forced out of the enclave \u2014 possibly without any right to return \u2014 so it can be turned into a new luxury real estate development, has fueled anxiety across the region.",
      "Critics have condemned the idea as would-be ethnic cleansing, and America's regional allies Egypt and Jordan, which Mr. Trump has suggested should take in the displaced Palestinians, have adamantly rejected the idea and, along with other Arab nations, are expected to present an alternative proposal to redevelop Gaza.",
      "Witkoff told Brennan that while the level of devastation in Gaza and the risks posed by unexploded ordinance \"suggest that nobody can really live there in a safe environment for probably at least 15 years\u2026 I'm not sure that anyone has a problem with people, with people returning. We've had these discussions around that. I just think the fundamental issue today is how we get phase two done, and then develop a reconstruction plan for Gaza.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's envoy was clear, however, that Hamas \"cannot be allowed to come back into the government\" in Gaza, saying the group that has run Gaza for almost 20 years, \"has to go. They've got to leave.\"",
      "He could not say where the group's remaining members should be sent, however, or who or what should be brought in to replace them as a governing body in the territory.",
      "\"I think the devil is in the details, and we've had a lot of discussions around it. I'm not at liberty to have that, that specific discussion today, but we've got some ideas, and that will be part of the negotiation,\" he said.",
      "Hamas said after the final exchange of phase one on Thursday that it was \"ready\" to engage in negotiations on the terms of a second phase.",
      "The news that Israeli negotiators were headed for Cairo, with the end of phase one looming on Saturday, will offer some hope to the families of the 59 remaining Israeli hostages \u2014 along with some 2 million Palestinians in Gaza and millions of people across the Middle East \u2014 for a continuation of diplomacy rather than a resumption of war.",

      "Those with symptoms were shown to have lower levels of two types of white blood cells. People with PVS who had never had COVID also had lower levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, likely because they tended to have fewer vaccine doses, according to the release.",
      "\"Post-vaccination syndrome is real, and has been found [to occur] from many vaccines.\"",
      "\"Fewer vaccine doses and no viral infection means the body\u2019s immune system has had little opportunity to develop a defense to the virus,\" said the researchers.",
      "Some of the people with PVS also had higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which enables the virus to penetrate and infect host cells. This has also been linked to a higher risk of developing long COVID.",

      "\"We don\u2019t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS who didn\u2019t have any measurable spike protein \u2014 but it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,\" said Iwasaki.",
      "People with the syndrome may suffer from excessive fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, insomnia and dizziness, according to the Yale researchers.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "In addition to the elevated spike proteins, other factors could increase the risk of post-vaccination syndrome. Those include autoimmunity, tissue damage and reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the researchers wrote.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: Republicans are demanding records showing the extent to which the Biden administration used taxpayer money to defend its position that student-athletes are employees of the universities for which they play.",
      "Representatives Tim Walberg, R-Mich., and Rick Allen, R-Ga., made the request in a letter to Marvin Kaplan, the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) newly appointed chairman, and acting General Counsel William Cowen. They demanded a full accounting of the expenditures incurred during the Biden administration's years-long case against the University of Southern California, the Pac-12 Conference and the NCAA.",
      "President Joe Biden's NLRB argued the entities intentionally obscured the rights of college athletes by labeling them \"student-athletes\" and not \"employees.\"",
      "The request for expenditure reports from Walberg, who chairs the House Committee on Education and Workforce, and Allen, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions, comes as there is a growing appetite on Capitol Hill to enact reforms for the NCAA's new name, image and likeness (NIL) rules.",

      "The rule change allowed student-athletes to profit from their NIL, which was previously prohibited by the NCAA. Walberg and Allen's letter said the expenditure records will \"provide important assistance to Congress in determining whether legislative changes are warranted.\"",
      "\"The Committee is concerned that the Biden-Harris NLRB spent significant taxpayer resources pursuing a case meant to curry favor with union interests for nearly three years,\" the letter states. \"The outcome could have upended intercollegiate athletics and stripped numerous scholarship opportunities from American students.\"",
      "The NLRB's general counsel during the Biden administration, Jennifer Abruzzo, issued a September 2021 memo explaining that the National Labor Relations Act, the nation's primary federal law protecting union organizing, \"fully support[s] the conclusion that certain Players at Academic Institutions are statutory employees.\" The announcement came just a few months after the NCAA began letting students profit from NIL after public pressure and state court cases.",
      "While the change in how college athletes are treated has been welcomed by many, others have been concerned about the move's potential implications. Earlier this month, the Trump administration rescinded the Biden administration NLRB's September 2021 memo insisting college athletes be recognized as employees under federal labor laws.",
      "The Trump administration this month also revoked guidance issued by President Joe Biden on his way out of the White House that required schools to distribute direct NIL payments equally to female and male athletes.",
      "HOW NAME, IMAGE AND LIKENESS LAWS HAVE CHANGED COLLEGE SPORTS",

      "A player announces his choice to sign with the USC Trojans on National Signing Day at Long Beach Poly High School in Long Beach, Calif.\u00a0 (Chris Williams/Icon Sportswire/Corbis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)",
      "\"Are unions going to step in between a coach and their athletes for yelling at the players, or because practice went long or because they're making them run an exceptional amount of lines?\" Withe wondered. \"If you're represented by a union, they're now your bargaining agent. You have no ability to go represent yourself in anything with the university if it is deemed they are your employer. You've got no ability to go negotiate with them anymore.\"",
      "Withe pointed out that the move could also lead schools to cut sports programs if they are not generating enough revenue, will affect the long-held tradition that meritocracy is the root of athletic competition and increase the financial burden on schools hoping to keep their athletic programs competitive.",
      "\"Public institutions, they're already forking over a cost for the NIL deals. Providing college athletes the same protections as typical employees is just going to increase their tax burden because it's going to be paying players that ordinarily wouldn't be getting paid. Schools are going to be forced to pay those guys, so there's going to be a bigger tax bill associated with it,\" Withe said.",
      "FORMER MIAMI BASKETBALL COACH JIM LARRANAGA LEFT \u2018EXHAUSTED\u2019 BY NIL'S IMPACT ON COLLEGE SPORTS",
      "\"Attracting top-tier talent is going to be the hardest thing,\" he added. \"Because you've got a contract among all of your athletes \u2014 let's say, for football or basketball or whatever \u2014 you can't then go and bring in a superstar, a stud quarterback, because you can't pay them the same level that you could without the union. \u2026 Basically, money would sort of have to go over to the bigger revenue-generating sports to compensate everyone equally.\"",
      "The letter from Walberg and Allen added that, under an employee-employer relationship, student-athletes could be forced to start paying federal taxes on any scholarship funds they receive.",

      "Proponents of the move to classify college athletes as employees say it is high time student-athletes begin getting their piece of the financial pie.",
      "\"Colleges and universities have profited off student athletes for decades. It\u2019s the government's job \u2014 not its burden \u2014 to make sure student athletes' rights are respected and they get their fair share,\" Karla Walter, senior fellow for Inclusive Economy at the Center for American Progress, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Walter added that unionization is viewed favorably among those who don't have the option to be in one.",
      "\"Half of non-union workers say they would join a union if they could, but unionization rates hover around 6% in the private sector,\" she said.",
      "\"Student-athletes generate tens of millions of dollars for their universities,\" said Andrew Stettner, director of economy and jobs at The Century Foundation. \"Just like anyone else whose labor enriches a broader entity, they have a right under the National Labor Relations Act to collectively bargain for things like revenue sharing, workplace conditions and protections from injury,\"",

    "story": [
      "Jose-Marie Griffiths discusses the increasingly important subject with Fox News Digital.",
      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",
      "Now, Microsoft has identified a resurfaced malware that has returned after years, equipped with new malicious capabilities, including stealing sensitive information such as digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.",
      "STAY SAFE & IN THE KNOW \u2013 AT NO COST! SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT FOR FREE SECURITY ALERTS & TECH TIPS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",
      "A person working on their Mac (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAM",
      "What data can it steal?",
      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "Hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware.",
      "We saw a rise in infostealer malware in 2024, with hackers using it to steal credentials, cryptocurrency and other personal data from millions of users. If you recall, I reported countless\u00a0incidents of an infostealer called Lumma preying on Android, Windows and even iOS and Mac users.",
      "A new cybersecurity report now highlights that hackers using Lumma, along with StealC, Redline and other infostealers, infected 4.3 million machines in 2024, leading to an astonishing 330 million compromised credentials.",
      "Security researchers have also observed 3.9 billion credentials shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Infostealer-related attacks on the rise in 2024",
      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs. KELA\u2019s analysis suggests that almost 65% of infected devices were personal computers storing corporate credentials, making them a prime target for infostealer malware.",

      "2025 is not going to be any different",
      "Infostealer malware is not going anywhere in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more advanced, cybercriminals will likely keep using them as a go-to method for stealing credentials and gaining access to systems.",
      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "Ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

These DNA tests aren\u2019t just about satisfying curiosity; people buy them to uncover important health information, connect with loved ones or give thoughtful gifts.",
      "But here\u2019s the thing \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking from a data privacy perspective here \u2013 genetic information is highly valuable and a risk to unlocking deeply intimate information unique to only you. And while these commercial DNA tests seem harmless, they come with risks that most people don\u2019t immediately think about. Once you hand over your DNA, you\u2019re giving these companies access to your most personal data. And believe me, what happens to that data after the test can be anything but straightforward.",

      "Illustration of human DNA (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s the big deal?",
      "Your DNA is more than just a string of letters; it's a unique and permanent blueprint of your identity. Using a commercial DNA testing service can mean handing over not only physical samples but also information about potential medical conditions and predispositions, ethnicity and familial connections and even behavioral or lifestyle markers. This can put you at risk of things like genetic testing without your consent, increased insurance premiums, health-related scams and family secrets coming to light, sometimes with painful consequences.\u00a0One woman even felt that she \"lost her entire family\" after taking one of these tests.",
      "And here\u2019s the kicker: Even if you choose to stay out of the genetic testing game, if anyone who shares some of your DNA, like your brother or your niece, chooses to take one, it can still expose you to many of these risks without you even knowing.",
      "What does happen to your genetic data?",
      "Aside from doing what the services advertise, it turns out that many DNA testing services may be sharing your genetic data with researchers, marketers, insurance companies and even law enforcement agencies.",
      "In fact, according to recent research, half of commercial DNA testing services use your genetic data for research (both internal and external). Nearly half (4 in 10) use it for marketing. And nearly half (also 4 in 10) also share your data with law enforcement agencies, potentially without any kind of subpoena or court order.",
      "While DNA testing companies often claim to use anonymized data for many of these purposes, the reality is that \"anonymized\" genetic information can\u00a0often be re-identified when combined with other data sources, sources like data brokers and people search sites that hold and sell troves of information (like lists of vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing dementia) that could be used toward this purpose.",

According to Dr. Divya Vats, a clinical biochemical geneticist at Kaiser Permanente,\u00a0at-home genetic tests aren\u2019t as accurate as medical DNA tests ordered by your doctor. This can lead to unnecessary anxiety or false reassurance regarding your health. Even when it comes to ethnicity and ancestry, results usually rely on statistical comparisons to reference populations, which\u00a0don\u2019t necessarily yield accurate results, especially if you\u2019re from a less-studied ethnic group.",

According to an investigative journalist who tried to have her genetic footprint wiped, it was \"brutally difficult.\" Recent events, like 23andMe going bankrupt, highlight just how precarious the situation can be.",
      "Consumers are left worried about what will happen to their genetic data if a testing company is sold or acquired, especially when they have no easy way to retrieve or destroy that data. These companies often don\u2019t disclose where and how your samples are stored, either.",
      "According to Incogni, a data broker removal service, almost none of the DNA testing services it investigated provided any information more substantial than that of a \"secure facility.\" This lack of transparency about where their data is stored and how it can be destroyed creates a major roadblock for anyone trying to regain control over their genetic information.",

      "If you\u2019re still considering using a DNA service, if your genetic information has already been exposed or if you just want to take preventative steps, here are some things to do.",
      "1) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Proactively remove your personal information from online data brokers and people search sites to minimize the risk of linking anonymized genetic data back to you. Not only will this clean up and prevent your health and genetic data from circulating the web, but it\u2019ll also make it much harder for your anonymized data (genetic or otherwise) to be linked to you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Choose reputable companies: Select well-known and trusted DNA testing providers, as they are more likely to adhere to privacy and security standards due to public scrutiny.",
      "3) Review privacy options during sign-up: Pay close attention to privacy settings when registering your test kit. Many companies allow you to opt in or out of data sharing for research or marketing purposes.",
      "4) Limit data sharing: Carefully consider whether to permit your data to be shared with third parties. While you can revoke consent later, data already shared may not be fully retrievable or deletable.",
      "5) Delete data post-test: If you\u2019ve already taken a test, review the company\u2019s privacy policy and delete your data if possible. Note that data shared with third parties may remain accessible.",
      "6) Avoid uploading data to third-party databases: Refrain from uploading your genetic information to external services, which may share data with law enforcement or other entities without clear consent.",
      "7) Consider anonymous testing: Use anonymous methods when submitting DNA samples, such as pseudonyms or alternative payment methods, to reduce traceability.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your DNA holds some of the most personal and sensitive information about you, and once it\u2019s out there, you lose control over how it\u2019s used. From potential privacy violations to emotional surprises and the challenges of deleting your genetic data, DNA testing kits come with risks that many don\u2019t recognize upfront.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rose Girone, believed to be the oldest living Holocaust survivor and a strong advocate for sharing survivors' stories, has died. She was 113.",
      "She died Monday in New York, according to the Claims Conference, a New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.",
      "MY FATHER SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. CENSORSHIP DIDN\u2019T STOP THE NAZIS, IT HELPED THEM",
      "\"Rose was an example of fortitude but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,\" Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice president, said in a statement Thursday. \"The lessons of the Holocaust must not die with those who endured the suffering.\"",
      "Girone was born on January 13, 1912, in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was 6, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.",
      "When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Hitler, she said: \"Hitler came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody.\"",
      "Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "\"This passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,\" Schneider said. \"The Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today\u2019s world, to be forgotten.\"",
      "Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.",
      "She was 9 months pregnant living in Breslau, which is now Wroclaw, Poland, when Nazis arrived to take Mannheim to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Their family had two cars and so she asked her husband to leave his keys.",

      "She said she remembers one Nazi saying: \"Take that woman also.\"",
      "The other Nazi responded: \"She\u2019s pregnant, leave her alone.\"",
      "The next morning her father-in-law was also taken and she was left alone with their housekeeper.",
      "After her daughter Reha was born in 1938, Girone was able to secure Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband's release.",
      "In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only 6 months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.",
      "Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.",
      "But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bed bugs crawled through their belongings.",
      "Her father-in-law came just before World War II started but became sick and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself \"King of the Jews.\"",
      "\"They did really horrible things to people,\" Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. \"One of our friends got killed because he wouldn\u2019t move fast enough.\"",
      "Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors, as British radios were not allowed.",
      "When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone\u2019s mother, grandmother and other relatives in the U.S. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.",
      "They arrived in New York City in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.",
      "Girone was also reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his U.S. citizenship by joining the Army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was her first time seeing him in 17 years.",

      "Girone later divorced Mannheim. In 1968, she met Jack Girone, the same day her granddaughter was born. By the next year they were married. He died in 1990.",
      "When asked in 1996 for the message she would like to leave for her daughter and granddaughter, she said: \"Nothing is so very bad that something good shouldn't come out of it. No matter what it is.\""

      "According to the IDF\u2019s assessment, 5,000-5,600 militants infiltrated Israel in three waves. Meanwhile, 4,696 rockets and mortars were fired towards Israel. The attacks left 829 Israeli civilians, 76 foreign nationals and 415 security personnel dead. Additionally, 251 hostages were taken into the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fundamental failure was a result of failure to understand Hamas's intentions and readiness for a wide-scale surprise attack,\" IDF senior officials say in the report.",
      "2. Hamas attack timeline",
      "Hamas\u2019 attacks were not done hastily, according to the IDF, the planning began nearly seven years before the massacre, with the formation of the \"fundamental concept\" in November 2016 and an \"initial plan\" in July 2017. Hamas\u2019 plan was approved in July 2019 and the operational plan was set in August 2021. In early 2022, a readiness committee was established and over the course of the year the terror group evaluated options for implementing its plan.",
      "The IDF says Hamas considered numerous dates for the attacks, including Sept. 16, which was Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Sept. 25, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Ultimately, Oct. 7, 2023, which coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which marks the end and re-start of the Torah.",
      "This image from video provided by South First Responders shows charred and damaged cars along a desert road after an attack by Hamas terrorists at the Tribe of Nova Trance music festival near Kibbutz Re'im in southern Israel on Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023.\u00a0 (South First Responders via AP)",
      "LOOKING BACK ON THE TIMELINE OF ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS AFTER OCT. 7",
      "3. Full timeline of Oct. 7",
      "The attack, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment began taking shape in the early hours of Oct. 7. Hamas allegedly began preparing its forces around 11:00 p.m. on Oct. 6, after spending much of the day putting them on alert and gathering weapons, and concluded briefings by 4:00 a.m. on Oct. 7.",
      "The infiltration itself began with the first wave at 6:29 a.m. when 1,154 members of Hamas\u2019 Nukhba forces invaded, breaking the security barrier between Gaza and Israel. The IDF declared a state of emergency at 6:43 a.m., and at 7:10 a.m. the Israeli Air Force (IAF) followed suit.",
      "Between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., 3,400 militants were inside Israeli territory. Additionally, just before 8:00 a.m., Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on civilians in Gaza to join the attacks. The assessment states that after 9:00 a.m. attackers took advantage of IDF failures and seized opportunities to further the assault. Some allegedly planned to go deeper into Israeli territory.",
      "Several of the \"main attacks\" were stopped by the IDF around 1:00 p.m., but there were still hundreds of attackers in Israel at 3:00 p.m. The IDF says it gained control of some of the communities and surrounding areas by 9:00 p.m., but dozens were present around midnight.",
      "\"We did not predict Hamas would be able to be so brutal in its fighting,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",
      "4. IDF\u2019s incorrect assessment of threats",
      "Much of the IDF\u2019s focus was on Iran and Hezbollah prior to the Oct. 7 attacks, and Hamas was defined as a secondary threat at the time. Additionally, the IDF assumed that it could contain Hamas activity as it worked toward \"gradually improving the existing reality\" with the goal of removing the terror group.",
      "The IDF also believed that \"Hamas didn\u2019t want a full-scale war,\" leading Israel to conclude that a large-scale invasion was unlikely. In the assessment, the IDF says Hamas took advantage of Israel\u2019s perception of the situation and used it to its advantage.",
      "Another major misconception highlighted in the assessment is the IDF\u2019s thinking that the main threat from Hamas were the rockets and mortars being shot from Gaza. This combined with reliance on defense tactics and a barrier, as well as the reduction of troops on the Israel-Gaza border would lead to catastrophe.",
      "5. Intelligence failures",
      "Israel\u2019s Intelligence Directorate did not fully grasp or analyze intel it had on Hamas and its intentions. This apparently also applies to the IDF\u2019s perception of the Shi\u2019ite \"Axis\" and its views on Israel. The IDF says that during the review it found deep-rooted systemic issues with the intelligence directorate and culture.",
      "Since 2018, the Intelligence Directorate had been gathering information on Hamas\u2019 concept for a large-scale attack on Israel. However, the plan was deemed unfeasible and was thought to reflect Hamas\u2019 long-term goals.",
      "In August 2021, intel on Hamas\u2019 military wing described the plan for a large-scale attack on Israeli communities and military outposts surrounding the Gaza Strip. Intelligence officials failed to make the connection between this new intel and what it had gathered in 2018.",
      "The intelligence received in the months leading up to Oct. 7 indicated that Hamas was carrying out training exercises for raids. This apparently changed Israel\u2019s elite Unit 8200\u2019s assessment of the situation, but this was allegedly not communicated with senior leadership.",
      "Israeli soldiers inspect the burnt cars of festival-goers at the site of an attack on the Nova Festival by Hamas gunmen from Gaza, near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, in southern Israel, Oct. 13, 2023.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)",
      "ISRAELI ARMY FINDS BODIES OF 3 HOSTAGES IN GAZA KILLED AT OCT. 7 MUSIC FESTIVAL",
      "6. \"Early signs\" missed",
      "In the evening hours of Oct. 6, 2023, Israeli sim cards were activated inside Gaza. However, this was not alerted as it had happened before. Those same sim cards would later allow Hamas militants to communicate after they crossed the border into Israel. There were also indications that night that Hamas leaders were meeting. However, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment, neither of these facts were enough to change the Intelligence Directorate\u2019s way of thinking on Gaza, therefore there was no alert.There were also indications of both usual and unusual Hamas activity that evening. The inquiry revealed that there were intelligence sources that could have been utilized overnight to enhance information that were not used. However, the IDF asserts that had the Intelligence Directive changed its assessment of the situation, there would have been a higher alert for a localized Hamas offensive, but not for an all-out war.",
      "7. Assessment of the IAF",
      "The IAF was found to have met and even exceeded the defined standards for readiness except for two instances due to heavy rocket fire. However, these standards did not align with what would have been required to prepare for a large-scale surprise attack. The IDF concluded that there was \"significant difficulty\" distinguishing IDF troops, civilians and terrorists from one another.",
      "While the IAF struck key Hamas command centers, the IDF admits that even in its review of the strikes it is challenging to determine if there could have been a more effective strike effort given the circumstances.",
      "However, it was noted that the IDF did not prepare for anything like the brutal Oct. 7 massacre.\"We were addicted to the precise intelligence and information we got as commanders and did not consider other scenarios. This failure will forever be etched in our memories, and we will never and should never forget,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "In its conclusion, the IDF notes that the assessment of the situation in Gaza and regarding Hamas was so entrenched in the establishment that there was no deep discussion about alternate possibilities. Additionally, it now says that it was \"incorrect\" to try to \"conflict manage\" Hamas and, in the future, the removal of threats should be prioritized.",
      "The assessment also addresses the possibility of a future attack, saying that a preventative strategy will be key.",

      "Huckabee said, \"Let's be real clear. When President Trump was in office in his first term, the maximum pressure that he put on Iran bankrupted them. President Trump didn't have to bomb them, but he bankrupted them. They didn't have any money, and they couldn't fund the hoodies, Hezbollah or Hamas. Joe Biden comes in, takes the pressure off. They get money again. They fund terrorism. They fund the building of their bomb. And now we're having to go back. Thank goodness the president has reestablished the pressure on Iran economically. That's a plus.\"",

      "Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran UANI, told Fox News Digital, \"I think Gov. Huckabee\u2019s comments underscore the danger Iran\u2019s regime poses to the U.S. and our allies and partners. It\u2019s why presidents for years have stated an Iran with nuclear weapons is unacceptable and that the U.S. will use all instruments of national power to prevent that outcome. One of the pillars of Tehran\u2019s grand strategy is the eradication of Israel and another is anti-Americanism.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump, ready to wrap up his Oval Office meeting Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, asked for one last question from the reporters gathered in the room.",
      "That's when Vice President JD Vance jumped in instead, responding to a previous question about Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin by praising Trump's diplomatic approach to the war in Ukraine.",
      "His comments yielded a sharp rejoinder from Zelenskyy, steering an already tense discussion into an unexpected, full-blown, high-volume argument for the world to watch.",
      "For the next seven minutes, Vance and Trump exchanged increasingly heated words with their visitor.\u00a0Vance accused Zelenskyy of being disrespectful in the White House, of not being thankful enough for U.S. assistance and of embarking on a \u201cpropaganda tour.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy pointedly questioned Vance\u2019s authority on Ukraine, asking if he\u2019d ever been to the country, prompting Vance to reply that he\u2019d \u201cwatched and seen the stories.\u201d Then Trump tagged in, coming to his vice president\u2019s defense by demanding that Zelenskyy be more thankful and asserting that the Ukrainian leader was \u201cgambling with World War III.\u201d",
      "It was, in the words of Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and State Department appointee during Trump\u2019s first term, \u201ca horrible day for the peacemakers.\u201d",
      "It was also a sign of how Vance, who as a senator was known for his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine, is asserting himself on matters of foreign policy immediately as vice president. Earlier this month, Vance made waves at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that took sharp aim at other world leaders. And on Thursday, the day before tangling with Zelenskyy, Vance mixed it up in an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 albeit in a much lighter tone.",
      "\u201cLook, I said what I said,\u201d Vance responded Thursday when a reporter asked him about his comments in Munich that were critical of alleged free speech violations in the United Kingdom.",
      "Starmer replied politely: \u201cIn relation to free speech in the U.K., I\u2019m very proud of our history there.\u201d",
      "The confrontation Friday with Zelenskyy was far frostier \u2014 spurred not by a reporter\u2019s question but, according to those close to the vice president, by Vance\u2019s desire to push back on what he believed was Zelenskyy\u2019s inappropriate behavior in a diplomatic environment.",
      "\u201cThe path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy,\u201d Vance said after pre-empting Trump\u2019s attempt to field one last inquiry from the media. \u201cWe tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States\u2019 words mattered more than the president of the United States\u2019 actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That\u2019s what President Trump is doing.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy then asked for and received permission to address Vance directly, noting that Ukraine had previously made diplomatic agreements with Russia that were then violated.",
      "\u201cHe killed our people, and he didn\u2019t exchange prisoners,\u201d a visibly agitated Zelenskyy said, referring to Putin, who has been at war with Ukraine for three years. \u201cWhat kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\u201d",
      "Vance shot back that it was \"disrespectful\" for Zelenskyy to \"come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.\" Things only got more tense from there.",
      "An earlier meeting Friday between Zelenskyy and senators was \u201cvery bipartisan and very supportive,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. Asked about the more rancorous tone in the Oval Office, Whitehouse said: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for letting Vance in the room.\u201d",
      "A source familiar with the planning for the Trump meeting said there was no predetermined strategy for Vance to confront Zelenskyy the way he did. Vance, the source added, felt compelled to respond after finding Zelenskyy needlessly provocative in his demeanor.",
      "\u201cNo one expected Zelenskyy to come in there and act entitled,\u201d said this person, who added that the expectation was the Oval Office meeting would go off like a typical bilateral meeting.",
      "Another source familiar with Vance\u2019s thinking going into the meeting said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone expected [Zelenskyy] to walk in there and act like such a petulant child.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who has supported sending aid to Ukraine, called Zelenskyy\u2019s meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster,\u201d saying that \u201cthe way he confronted the president was just over the top.\u201d",
      "Graham also said he was \u201cvery proud of JD Vance standing up for our country.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s long-standing views on Ukraine aid are well-established, and Zelenskyy in the past has made no effort to hide his disapproval of the vice president, having called him \u201ctoo radical\u201d in an interview last year with The New Yorker, when Vance was running on Trump's ticket.",
      "On Friday, Vance called back to a visit Zelenskyy made ahead of last fall\u2019s election to Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania \u2014 a trip that Republicans have characterized as a sign of support for the Democratic ticket. Zelenskyy visited a munitions factory in Scranton and met with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, at the White House.",
      "\u201cYou went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October,\u201d Vance told Zelenskyy. \u201cOffer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who\u2019s trying to save your country.\u201d",
      "The adversarial tone reminded some observers of Vance's Munich speech.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from and of course, that\u2019s important,\u201d Vance said there, addressing European leaders. \u201cBut what has seemed a little bit less clear to me ... is what exactly you\u2019re defending yourselves for?\u201d",
      "Bartlett, who resigned from the first Trump administration on Jan. 6, 2021, over Trump\u2019s response to the attack on the U.S. Capitol, acknowledged that Zelenskyy \u201cmay have come in, possibly, with the wrong posture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows how personality is critical to policy, and how one bad meeting, you know, can be so potentially damning in history,\u201d Bartlett said.",
      "\u201cThere are plenty that will see Vance as being wildly inappropriate, even stepping over the president,\u201d Bartlett added. \u201cAnd there are plenty that feel as if Vance said what needs to be said for the past three years.",
      "\u201cAnd it seems, regardless of where anyone comes down, the vice president was very eager to make this point,\u201d Bartlett continued. \u201cIt was an echo of his speech at Munich, it echoes his online persona, and you saw the personification of it now in a critical, tense foreign policy situation.\u201d"

      "In a\u00a0trove\u00a0of statements released late Thursday, federal employees said that the mass layoff was discussed in meetings they attended this month with senior CFPB leaders and members of\u00a0Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cMy team was directed to assist with terminating the vast majority of CFPB employees as quickly as possible,\u201d said an employee identified as Alex Doe, a pseudonym used out of fear of retaliation.",
      "Doe said the plan from CFPB leaders and DOGE was to cut the bureau\u2019s workforce in three phases. It would first eliminate\u00a0probationary\u00a0and term employees, then carry out a wave of about 1,200 layoffs, leaving a skeleton crew of a few hundred workers.",
      "\u201cFinally, the Bureau would \u2018reduce altogether\u2019 within 60-90 days by terminating most of its remaining staff,\u201d Doe said.",
      "The workers\u2019 testimony comes at a crucial time for the CFPB, the agency created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis was caused, in part, by irresponsible lending. Since DOGE operatives first arrived at the CFPB this month, the bureau has closed its Washington headquarters, initiated the first round of layoffs, and told those who remain to stop\u00a0nearly all work.",
      "The filings were made in the\u00a0case\u00a0started by a CFPB union that suspended acting Director Russell Vought\u2019s moves to shutter the bureau. After the CFPB fired about 200 probationary and term employees, the agency\u2019s actions were put on hold until a hearing scheduled for Monday.",

      "\u201cCFPB leadership has also been apparently lying to us that it will allow us to follow the law and our statutory obligations to protect consumers,\" said a current CFPB employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions. \"Those of us employed at the CFPB will not stop fighting for our right to get back to the work of protecting consumers that Congress has required of us.\u201d",
      "In a\u00a0motion\u00a0filed Monday, Vought\u00a0pushed\u00a0back against the idea that he planned to eliminate the CFPB.",

      "But the Trump administration\u2019s plan was to take the CFPB down to the barest minimum staffing required under law: Just five CFPB employees would remain, either in a standalone office or folded into another regulatory body, the workers testified.",
      "In meetings from Feb. 18 to Feb. 25, \u201cstaff were told by Senior Executives that the CFPB would be eliminated except for the five statutorily mandated positions,\u201d said another current CFPB employee, this one identified as Drew Doe.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans are considering a far-reaching change to the budget process that would obscure the deficit impact of extending President Donald Trump\u2019s multitrillion-dollar tax cuts in order to avoid paying for them.",
      "It comes as part of a massive bill to advance Trump\u2019s agenda that Republicans are seeking to pass on a party-line basis. If the tactic is successful, it would upend long-standing precedent and change the accounting process for current and future lawmakers, with major policy stakes.",
      "Extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in 2017, would cost $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the official nonpartisan scorekeeper.",
      "That\u2019s under the \u201ccurrent law\u201d metric that has traditionally been used, as the tax cuts are slated to expire at the end of this year. But Senate Republicans want to use a different scoring method called the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d baseline, which would assume that extending tax cuts costs $0 because they\u2019re already law.",
      "The chair of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, endorsed the \u201ccurrent policy\u201d approach, telling reporters that it \u201crecognizes that extending current law does not change the tax policy, does not reduce tax revenue.\u201d",
      "Congressional GOP aides say the idea could have a huge impact on what they\u2019re able to pass in the budget bill. If they use the current accounting process, they have no chance of making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, because that would require paying for it. And this process would also be key to unlocking Trump\u2019s other tax proposals, like slashing taxes on tips and overtime pay.",
      "It\u2019s a tacit admission that Republican leaders have no expectation of paying for the cost of their tax agenda.",
      "\u201cAssuming this is allowed under budget rules,\u00a0this would represent a\u00a0massive\u00a0budget gimmick\u00a0that would justify and allow trillions of dollars of new borrowing,\u201d warned the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based research group that advocates for lower deficits.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., backed the idea, arguing that continuing tax cuts shouldn\u2019t score as adding any new red ink.",
      "\u201cWe should be using \u2018current policy.\u2019 We need to avoid a massive, automatic tax increase,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems like a perfectly rational thing to do, and there shouldn\u2019t be a score.\u201d",
      "The path to achieve that accounting change is uncertain. GOP aides believe it would begin with Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., making an executive decision to pursue the alternative scoring method.",
      "But even if Senate Republicans back him up, establishing it in practice is murkier and could run into roadblocks under the budget law that governs the process. Democrats could try to block it by appealing to the Senate parliamentarian, who referees disputes during the budget reconciliation process.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Democrats \u201csure as hell will\u201d fight to stop Republicans from upending the budget process.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to fool anybody at all. What they\u2019re trying to do is spend more money \u2014 and they\u2019re going to spend it on billionaires,\u201d Wyden said in an interview. \u201cThis is a phony, fake concept.\u201d",
      "Republicans may also face some internal resistance from deficit hawks who consider that idea a gimmick, especially in the House.",
      "\u201cWe should be careful with things like that, that can get kind of gimmicky,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued by the possibility of permanence. I think that\u2019s a good thing. I think permanent tax rates are good for the country. ... However, I don\u2019t like gimmicks, so I\u2019m trying to wrestle with that.\u201d",
      "Others say the idea of making the tax cuts permanent isn\u2019t make-or-break, given that future sessions of Congress and presidents can change tax policy anyway.",
      "\u201cYou know, there\u2019s nothing permanent around here,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not as hung up on permanency as some of my friends are.\u201d",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, said changing the accounting technique wouldn\u2019t prevent the Republican bill from blowing up the debt.",
      "\u201cThe Republicans need to realize that \u2018magic math\u2019 does not exist. Tax cuts cost money, even if Republicans say they don\u2019t, and the Treasury would still need to borrow trillions of dollars that would explode the deficit,\u201d Merkley told NBC News in a statement. \u201cRefusing to measure something doesn\u2019t mean it goes away. The earth is still warming even if you get rid of thermometers.\u201d",
      "Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., said it would set a \u201cterrible\u201d precedent if Republicans adopt that budgeting approach.",
      "He said it would be a backdoor way to nuke the filibuster and take an anything-goes approach to the reconciliation process, which Congress can use once per fiscal year to evade the 60-vote rule in the Senate for changes to spending and taxes. The process imposes significant constraints, like needing to pay for long-term laws that add to the U.S. debt.",
      "\u201cMy advice is: If they adopt that policy, we should advise the American people to forget about their credit card debt,\u201d Neal said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to analyze revenue and expenditure.\u201d",
      "If Republicans succeed, they could set a precedent that may come back to haunt them, Democrats warn. For example, Democrats could extend temporary programs indefinitely without finding any mechanisms to pay for it. They could create a costly program on a one-year basis and make it permanent the following year by scoring it at a cost of $0, given that it\u2019s already in law.",
      "Still, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., endorsed the idea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really important principle, and I hope that we can employ that, because it makes a big difference in the calculations. And I think it also makes good logical sense,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re extending the existing law. And by definition, that\u2019s what current policy means.\u201d",
      "Trump wrote Wednesday on Truth Social, \u201cI hope the House and Senate are able to agree on making the Tax Cuts PERMANENT!\u201d",
      "Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., the chair of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said the way to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent would be to either change the way it\u2019s scored or allow for a higher deficit number in tax reforms.",
      "\u201cWell, it\u2019s a cost,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd so the policy baseline is one way to help get it. Or a higher number.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order aimed at making English the official language of the U.S., according to a White House official.",
      "It\u2019s the first time in history the country would have an official language, though the majority of U.S. states have already designated English as their official language. It is unclear when Trump will sign the order.",
      "People who go through the naturalization process to become U.S. citizens are also required to take an English test in which they \"must demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including the ability to read, write, and speak basic English,\" according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
      "While English is the most widely used language in the country, U.S. residents communicate in more than 350 languages, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. More than three-quarters of Americans speak only English at home, according to the bureau.",
      "The change is consistent with Trump's hard-line immigration stance, including his executive order ending birthright citizenship \u2014 which several courts have struck down.",
      "During the 2024 presidential campaign, he railed against undocumented immigrants that didn't speak English and warned about the languages that were \"coming into our country.\"",
      "At the presidential debate against then-Vice President Kamala Harris in September, he said, \u201cThey can\u2019t even speak English. They don\u2019t even know what country they\u2019re in, practically\" and last April, he said that the town of Whitewater, Wisconsin, was full of undocumented immigrants who \u201cdon\u2019t speak a word of English.\"",
      "In remarks at the March 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump said, \u201cWe have languages coming into our country. We don\u2019t have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language ... These are languages \u2014 it\u2019s the craziest thing \u2014 they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It\u2019s a very horrible thing.\"",
      "Trump's own vice president has previously pushed for English to be the country's official language. In the last Congress, then-Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, introduced the English Language Unity Act with Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., which would have required the federal government to use English \"in commonsense circumstances.\"",
      "\u201cThis commonsense legislation recognizes an inherent truth: English is the language of this country. That is why the overwhelming majority of the American people support this proposal,\u201d\u00a0Vance said in a statement when they unveiled the measure. \u201cThe English language has been a cornerstone of American culture for over 250 years. It is far past time for Congress to codify its place into law, which is exactly what this bill does.\u201d"

      "Simu Liu co-stars in a new survivalist escape movie about deep-sea divers battling the elements to rescue their crewmate. And, he said, the training required him to go to new depths \u2014 both mentally and physically.",
      "The actor, who co-stars with Woody Harrelson and Finn Cole in the film \u201cThe Last Breath,\u201d says he immersed himself in the world of saturation divers, deep-sea divers who descend to the bottom of the ocean to work on underwater engineering and ocean floor exploration. The movie hits theaters Friday.",
      "The movie dramatically retells the true story of Chris Lemons, a deep-sea diver who survived 40 minutes at the bottom of the North Sea with just 10 minutes worth of air in 2012. Lemons is played by Cole, and Liu plays co-diver David Yuasa. Harrelson plays the third diver, Duncan Allcock.",
      "\u201cOn the surface, no pun intended, it\u2019s this incredible story about survival in one of the most treacherous environments you can experience on the planet,\u201d Liu told NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s a window into the lives of these people who work in a field that I don\u2019t think anyone grows up thinking about or really knowing about.\u201d",
      "The actor says he was drawn to the camaraderie displayed by real-life saturation divers. The same spirit was needed between Liu and his co-stars as it was an incredibly physical and demanding role to prepare for.",
      "\u201cI had to do all of my dive training [with Finn] and he was the perfect dive partner because we needed actors that really loved being in the water. Because, if you even have a slight hesitancy or the idea of scuba diving for two months straight, four dives every day feels even a little bit scary or claustrophobic to you, then you probably shouldn\u2019t do a movie like this,\u201d Liu said.",
      "Ultimately, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a story about perseverance, the human spirit and never giving up,\u201d",
      "The actor also reflected on the changes the election has spurred and the fact that he has been an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s policy decisions.",
      "\u201cThe world is hurting right now and I feel like it has never been more difficult for people to be alive and live their lives. I\u2019m not a fan of people who make it more difficult for people to live their lives,\u201d Liu said. \u201cWe should all have a right to be happy. We should all have a right to make an honest and decent living with a decent wage. We used to take it as a given but now it doesn\u2019t feel quite as much so.\u201d",
      "The actor had posted multiple videos this year criticizing Trump\u2019s proposed plans for tax reform under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017.",
      "Liu said in a video: \u201cIt looks like I will get a tax cut. I wanted to say that I don\u2019t need a tax cut. I\u2019m happy to pay taxes and I actually believe that people like me probably should pay more tax. I\u2019ve been very fortunate and very privileged and I\u2019m happy to pay my fair share.\u201d",
      "Before becoming an actor, Liu studied business administration at the Ivey Business School and briefly worked as an accountant at Deloitte. However, it wasn\u2019t his economics background that prompted him to speak out; rather, he wanted to speak up for those without a voice, he said.",
      "Liu, who is Chinese Canadian, has broken barriers throughout his Hollywood career. Liu made history as the star of the first Asian-fronted movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.\u201d He gained further popularity with starring roles in Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie,\u201d \u201cKim\u2019s Convenience\u201d\u00a0 and \u201cArthur the King.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The West Texas measles outbreak continues to grow, now possibly spreading into the central part of the state and neighboring New Mexico, health officials said Friday.",
      "The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed there have been 146 cases of the highly contagious virus since the outbreak, centered in Gaines County, began in late January. Twenty people have been hospitalized and one child has died.",
      "Parts of Central Texas have been monitoring for measles cases ever since an infected person traveled from Gaines County to San Marcos and San Antonio over Valentine\u2019s Day weekend.",
      "The person visited the University of Texas at San Antonio campus and a variety of restaurants and convenience stores like Buc-ee\u2019s in other areas near the city.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that this person could have come in contact with, if not hundreds, thousands of our community residents, as well as visitors,\u201d Anita Kurian, San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Deputy Director of Communicable Disease, said at a media briefing Friday. \u201cWe are a destination city.\u00a0We have real great concern of potential large community wide exposures at these public sites.\u201d",
      "In a separate briefing Friday, Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock\u2019s health department, said most of the community is vaccinated, although because measles is so contagious, they are reaching out to families and closely monitoring schools for more infections.",
      "\u201cI do expect to see additional cases,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very nervous about getting a measles case in a school or a day care. We are closely monitoring that.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at both the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and the city\u2019s Health Authority, cautioned that people may not know if they\u2019ve been exposed. The incubation period is seven to 14 days. The earliest symptoms are a cough, a runny nose and conjunctivitis, or red, watery eyes, followed by sore spots in the mouth and a high fever of 103-104 degrees. A rash typically begins on the scalp or face and works its way down the body, he said.",
      "People are infectious \u201cfrom four days before the rash appears until four days after the rash,\u201d said Cook. \u201cThen it\u2019s another 10 days to get over the disease.\u201d",
      "Kurian said her office is getting up to 80 calls a day from people who are concerned about their exposure to measles in San Antonio. It could be at least a week until cases reveal themselves.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see any cases coming out of these exposures by March 8,\u201d she said.",
      "Most or all of the hospitalized patients have been children. Kids who have been admitted are either extremely dehydrated or are having serious trouble breathing, Cook said during the briefing Friday.",
      "Small children have tiny airways that can\u2019t easily handle the massive amounts of inflammation caused by measles, he said.",
      "Most of the cases are unvaccinated children, including a school-age child who died on Wednesday.",
      "Health officials are also trying to figure out if nine\u00a0measles cases in neighboring New Mexico, announced previously, are linked to the Texas outbreak.",
      "Cases unrelated to the current outbreak have also popped up in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City and Rhode Island.",
      "The origin of the West Texas outbreak, which is believed to have started within a close-knit Mennonite community, is unknown, Wells said Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have an answer anytime soon,\u201d she said, noting that other outbreaks in recent years have come from \u201ca U.S. citizen or someone traveling out of the country and bringing it back in.\u201d",
      "While measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world, it\u2019s controlled by widespread use of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) in a population. Two doses of the shot are 97% effective in preventing the disease, and the vast majority of U.S. kids get them as the CDC has long recommended: one dose around age 1, and another around age 5.",
      "As vaccine hesitancy has increased over time, fewer kids are getting their shots. The vaccine exemption rate in Gaines County was nearly 18% for the 2023-24 school year, according to\u00a0health department data.",
      "There are no vaccine mandates or forced quarantines in the communities affected by the current measles outbreak. There is, however, free testing and vaccinations being offered.",
      "\u201cWe learned lots of lessons during Covid,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe can\u2019t force anybody to take a drug. That\u2019s assault.\u201d",
      "Cook said he expects the outbreak will grow in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a huge wildfire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a smoldering fire, a tumbleweed fire, for a while until we finally get it stopped and put out.\u201d",
      "Late Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted its first public statement about the outbreak. According to the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services is \u201cproviding technical assistance, laboratory support, vaccines, and therapeutic medication as needed to the Texas Department of State and Health Services.\u201d",
      "The CDC said that vaccination \u201cremains the best defense against measles infection.\u201d Early in the outbreak, state health authorities in Texas asked for 2,000 extra doses of the MMR vaccine, which were provided by the CDC.",
      "There is no specific treatment or antiviral drug for measles. Doctors mainly try to keep patients hydrated and help them get enough oxygen."

      "That was the question facing Douglas Lane on the evening of Jan. 29 as his cellphone was filling up with alerts about an American Eagle plane colliding with an Army helicopter over the Potomac River, a plane that he knew his wife, Christine Lane, and son Spencer Lane were aboard.",
      "\u201cI looked at Milo, I didn\u2019t really know what to tell him,\u201d Lane, who lives in Rhode Island, told NBC News in his first interview since the tragedy. \u201cIn my gut, I knew what the outcome was. But I didn\u2019t want to say that they were gone until I knew they were gone.\u201d",

      "\u201cI had to really kind of word it very carefully so that he would still have some hope, but I also didn\u2019t want to create false hope,\u201d Lane said.",
      "Milo \u201ctook it pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty resilient.\u201d",
      "Final confirmation that the mother and son had perished, along with the 62 other people on the plane and the three soldiers on the Black Hawk helicopter, came the next day when Lane and his sister took the train to Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cThat was tough,\u201d Lane said, about leaving Milo behind with relatives. \u201cCertainly the decision to leave him the next day was the hardest of my life.\u201d",
      "A 16-year-old figure skating prodigy, Spencer, like many of the other passengers aboard American Eagle Flight 5342, was flying home from a training camp following the 2025 Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, where the flight originated.",
      "His mother, who was 49, had been chaperoning him on the trip. They were supposed to catch a connecting flight to Providence, Rhode Island, after landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, Lane said.",
      "Spencer was one of six members of the Skating Club of Boston, one of the nation\u2019s top figure skating programs, aboard the plane.",
      "Before taking off from Wichita, Spencer posted a photo on his Instagram Stories page of the view from his seat over the wing of the plane as it waited on the tarmac.",
      "Lane said he and Spencer had exchanged texts several times while his son was in Wichita but \u201che was busy doing his thing.\u201d He said he spoke to his wife shortly before she boarded the plane about what it\u2019s like to fly into this particular airport \u201cover the Potomac\u201d and how \u201cyou\u2019re going to see the Pentagon and all that.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut I was still tracking the flight because that\u2019s who I am,\u201d Lane said.",
      "Several hours later, Lane said his flight tracker \u201cshowed that they landed.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut they weren\u2019t responding to my texts,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Spencer would have turned his phone on even if he was sitting on the tarmac somewhere \u2026 so the fact that they were not in communication struck me as odd.\u201d",
      "It was then, Lane said, that he saw the first news alert on his phone \u201cthat a small plane had crashed in the Potomac.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy heart was literally pounding out of my chest,\u201d Lane said.",
      "A month later, Lane said both he and Milo are adjusting to their new reality. He said organizing a memorial for his wife and older son helped him cope with the loss. He said Milo is back in school and taking comfort in familiar routines.",
      "\u201cParenting Milo, knowing when to give him space, has been challenging,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not really a blueprint for the kind of situation I\u2019ve found myself in.\u201d",
      "Lane said he met Christine in 1999 and they got married three years later. An avid quilter who graduated from Syracuse University in 1997 and who had previously worked as a graphic designer, Christine Lane loved bright colors (especially orange). But above all, Lane said, she adored her sons.",
      "They adopted Spencer in South Korea in 2009, Lane said. And Spencer, who was then 9 months old, was already full of charisma, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would go into a restaurant and all eyes would be on him immediately,\u201d Lane said, chuckling slightly at the memory.",
      "Spencer was also a natural athlete who fell in love with figure skating shortly before the 2022 Winter Olympics.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare for people to start that late and be as good as he was,\u201d Lane said.",
      "In particular, Spencer idolized Asian American figure skaters such as Nathan Chen and Vincent Zhou, as well as Maxim Naumov, whose parents, Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, were coaches at the Skating Club of Boston and also died in the plane crash.",
      "Lane said figure skating became an all-consuming passion for the entire family and they spent a lot of time driving Spencer to and from practices in Norwood, Massachusetts.",
      "But the memory Lane said he cherishes most was of their return to Seoul a few years after Spencer joined the family to adopt Milo. He said it was around Christmastime and it felt odd to be celebrating \u201cin a foreign country.\u201d",
      "Spencer, he said, \u201cwas excited to be in Seoul. He got to meet his brother.\u201d",
      "Their family, Lane said, was \u201ccomplete.\u201d"

For four decades, he was a fugitive and wanted on attempted first-degree murder charges after he allegedly planted an explosive device in a toolbox outside the Wyoming home of his estranged wife's boyfriend, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico said in a news release.",

Campbell and Coffman both attended the University of Arkansas to pursue engineering. Authorities believe there was most \"likely a connection between the two\" because they attended the same school.",

      "He was charged with misuse of a passport, and investigators are evaluating additional charges, the attorney's office said. If convicted of misuse of a passport, Campbell faces up to 10 years in prison. A trial date has not yet been set.",

      "Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid will miss the remainder of the NBA regular season with a left knee injury, the team announced Friday.",
      "Embiid, 30, appeared in only 19 games for the 76ers this season. He has struggled when on the court, averaging his fewest points per game (23.8) since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Philadelphia 76ers and Joel Embiid have been consulting with top specialists regarding ongoing issues with his left knee,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cAfter further evaluation, it has been determined that he is medically unable to play and will miss the remainder of the season to focus on treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d",
      "Embiid\u2019s left knee has been an issue since last season, when he played in only 39 games because of a torn meniscus. He underwent surgery on the knee last year, and returned in time for Philadelphia\u2019s last five regular season games and first-round playoff loss to the New York Knicks.",
      "Embiid also played for the U.S. men\u2019s national basketball team in the 2024 Paris Olympics, but he missed the start of the NBA season with what the 76ers termed \u201cleft knee management.\u201d",
      "More from Sports",
      "Rams QB Matthew Stafford set to return to team next season They are the youngest, most inexperienced team in the NBA \u2014 and a favorite to win it all They are the youngest, most inexperienced team in the NBA \u2014 and a favorite to win it all",

      "They are the youngest, most inexperienced team in the NBA \u2014 and a favorite to win it all",
      "Embiid did not make his season debut until Nov. 12, and has been in and out of the lineup since. Earlier this month, he said another surgery on his left knee could be an option.",
      "\u201cI think the straightforward answer is that when you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s inconsistent, at some point, you\u2019ve got to do something about it,\u201d Embiid told reporters. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is. We\u2019re looking into every option.\u201d",
      "In addition to his injuries, Embiid also missed three games this season because of a suspension for a confrontation with a reporter in the locker room following a game. Embiid was upset with the journalist after a column that mentioned Embiid\u2019s son and dead brother.",
      "With their star player in and out of the lineup, Philadelphia has struggled. Entering Friday, the 76ers are 20-38 and in 12th place in the Eastern Conference.",
      "How Philadelphia finishes the regular season will be consequential.",
      "The 76ers currently have the sixth-worst record in the NBA. Philadelphia owes its 2025 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder, but it is protected for picks one through six, meaning the 76ers will keep their first rounder if it falls within that range.",
      "Philadelphia drafted Embiid third overall in the 2014 draft. He missed the first two seasons of his career due to injury before making his debut in 2016. In his career, Embiid has averaged 27.7 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game, though he has been unable to lead the 76ers to a conference finals, often due to injury.",
      "Since the end of the 2022-2023 season, when he won MVP, Embiid has appeared in only 58 regular season games. The big man has four years and $299.5 million remaining on his contract after signing a three-year extension last September."

      "Stafford was acquired by the Rams in January 2021 in one of the biggest trades in NFL history. He was sent to Los Angeles by the Detroit Lions in return for quarterback Jared Goff, two first-round picks and a third-round pick. Both sides benefited from the move, as the Rams won the league title the following year while the Lions rebuilt and became a contender.",
      "Friday's news could have an effect on the offseason's quarterback market. Teams, including the New York Giants and Cleveland Browns, were said to have an interest in Stafford. Now, they may turn to other veterans, including future Hall of Famer Aaron Rodgers."

      "\"I worry that everybody's going to see the success of 4 Nations and everybody's going to try and run to do something, and it's not going to be special,\" she said. \"It's not going to be high-quality.\"",
      "Fans and players alike criticized last week's NBA All-Star weekend, and it showed in the ratings. The game drew only 4.7 million viewers, according to Front Office Sports, down 13% year over year. It was the second-lowest All-Star Game in the last 25 years.",
      "ESPN NHL analyst P.K. Subban said much of that is based on the effort NBA players put into it.",

      "Baseball officials would suggest they don't need to stage a midseason international tournament since they already have the World Baseball Classic, which brought the planet's best to springtime competition in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2017 and 2023.",
      "The next tournament will be in March 2025.",
      "Organizers of 4 Nations benefited from having nearly all of the world's best hockey players already here, punching the clock for North American employers, so a high-level midseason competition wasn't hard to organize.",
      "A baseball form of 4 Nations probably wouldn't be able to include three-time WBC champion Japan or Korea, third- and second-place finishers in 2006 and 2009, with those players competing in domestic leagues in July.",
      "The best U.S., Dominican and Venezuelan baseball players are under contract for MLB teams, so a 4 Nations-like competition could be held during the All-Star break, but only with Western Hemisphere teams.",
      "Conrad and Anderson questioned whether games involving teams other than the 2017 champion Americans or the 2023 winning Japanese would be competitive enough to hold viewer interest.",
      "\"I don't know about the competitive balance there'd be between the U.S., Canada, Dominican Republic and Venezuela,\" Conrad said. \"I think there's a risk that you may get, like, 15-0 games.\"",
      "That would be in contrast to the 4 Nations tournament of close hockey games. Just one of the seven contests was a blowout \u2014 the rest were either one-goal games or two-goal games that included empty net scores.",
      "4 Nations\u2019 success \"really has to do with how the league is built and the structure of the players,\" Anderson said. \"No league is built for this the way the NHL is, where you can have four teams that are equally strong and competitive.\"",
      "It's also questionable whether MLB would want to play ball with its union to negotiate for a midseason international competition when an ugly labor battle is expected after the 2026 season.",
      "\"Of all of the all-star games out there, the baseball All-Star Game is considered the best,\" Conrad said. \"You still get reasonably good ratings and it's not the joke that the NHL and NBA all-star games are. Those are jokes.\"",

      "Of the 10 players who took part in Serbia's bronze-medal-winning game over Germany, six are plying their trade in Europe this season. Of the 12 players who got minutes for France in the gold medal game against the United States, seven are playing this season in Europe.",
      "Conrad, the Fordham professor, said there would be more upside to a midseason international basketball competition than a baseball version of it.",
      "\"Basketball is such an international game now, and baseball is not nearly as much,\" he said.",
      "Despite a logistical headache of bringing players from Greece, Turkey, Italy, Serbia and other corners of Europe for a potential midseason NBA-led international competition, Conrad said, it's doable.",
      "\"That'd be hard. You'd have to find the time to do it,\" he said. \"But you know what, if the World Cup can change its schedule in the midst of the soccer schedule, which it did in Qatar, then it can be done. I think there's a will to do it. It can be done for a very short, intense series. I think it's very possible.\"",
      "Success of the NHL\u2019s 4 Nations Face-Off was in stark contrast to the NBA All-Star Game, which some panned for its confusing format and unserious play.",
      "Anderson argued that the weekend of non-game events plays a key role in pop culture that's every bit as valuable as any on-the-floor action.",
      "\"The NBA All-Star Game, that event is about the influencers,\" Anderson said. \"It's about entertainment. It's about sponsors. It's really about everything that's going on around the weekend.\"",
      "The Pro Bowl is dead and gone",
      "Football, of course, is a uniquely American sport, so international play isn't a real option.",
      "And given the brutal physical nature of football, adding an extra game that doesn't lead to the Super Bowl is probably a nonstarter.",
      "Player apathy and half-speed play finally forced the league to conclude it could no longer go on with the charade of a normal game. So since Feb. 5, 2023, the Pro Bowl has been a contact-free flag football game.",
      "Conrad said he doesn't believe there'd be much fan outcry if the NFL and the NBA just did away with their all-star game events all together.",
      "\"The Pro Bowl is idiotic, and they're trying to come up with new ways and gimmicks,\" Conrad said. \"So it'd be easier to chuck them. I don't think the world would be unhappy if you chucked them.\"",

      "Legendary Packers coach Vince Lombardi hated the Playoff Bowl, once calling it \u201ca hinky-dink football game, held in a hinky-dink town, played by hinky-dink players.\"",
      "The Playoff Bowl had no real hope for staying power if a man like Lombardi, who put winning over everything, didn't put full commitment toward it.",

      "If you\u2019re staying in a hotel room in an NBA city and you hear someone fiddling with your door in the early hours of the morning, don\u2019t be alarmed \u2014 it could be Oklahoma City Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault.",
      "Daigneault says that amid the grind of a long, travel-heavy NBA season, it\u2019s not uncommon for him to sometimes use his key card on the wrong door because of how many different rooms he\u2019s using on a night-to-night basis.",
      "\u201cI was on the 10th floor yesterday, and I\u2019m on the 12th floor today,\u201d Daigneault told NBC News at the NBA Cup in December. \u201cThe thing that people don\u2019t see is how long the season is. It\u2019s a gauntlet of travel, games. It\u2019s difficult to maintain your energy throughout the course of the season.",
      "\u201cNo one would trade it for anything, but it can be a grind. Having people that bring energy to that every single day, that\u2019s what gives everybody oxygen.\u201d",
      "Fortunately for Daigneault, he can breathe easily, because he coaches one of the most energetic teams in the league.",
      "The Thunder, which entered the season with the youngest and most inexperienced roster in the NBA, have dominated the league with style for well over half the season. Led by a slew of under-30 stars, Oklahoma City is on pace to finish with a franchise-best 66 wins and the top seed in the Western Conference.",
      "\u201cEverybody enjoys being around each other,\u201d Daigneault said, \u201cand it brings great energy to our operation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not only energy \u2014 it\u2019s success.",
      "Through 58 games, the Thunder (47-11) boast the second-best record in the league, the NBA\u2019s top defense, an MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a chance to win more games in the regular games than Oklahoma City ever did when Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were in town.",
      "More from Sports",

      "Luka Don\u010di\u0107 records triple double in first game against Dallas Mavericks",
      "WNBA legend Diana Taurasi announces retirement",
      "And the Thunder are doing all of that even though their opening day roster had the youngest age (24.15) and least experience (2.56 seasons) of any franchise.",
      "\u201cI definitely count my blessings with this team,\u201d All-Star forward Jalen Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s super unique that everybody\u2019s around the same stage as their career, so we\u2019re able to kind of help each other. It\u2019s an extremely rare thing, given the concept and the landscape of the NBA. I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d",
      "The landscape of the NBA is one in which players can be moved, whether by their teams or their own engineering, at any moment. Just ask Luka Don\u010di\u0107, the superstar traded from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers in a blockbuster deal this month.",
      "Oklahoma City itself has been at the mercy of such movement, including when Durant left in free agency in 2016 or when it traded Westbrook in 2019.",
      "The current version of the Thunder, on the other hand, has come about after years of careful, steady building by general manager Sam Presti.",
      "Since Daigneault was hired in 2020, Oklahoma City has increased its win total every year, from 22 to 24 to 40 to 57 last season, and is on pace for more than 60 this one. In the same time, Presti has added players such as Williams, centers Chet Holmgren and Isaiah Hartenstein and guards Cason Wallace and Alex Caruso around Gilgeous-Alexander and sturdy defender Lu Dort to create one of the toughest teams in the NBA.",
      "The head of the snake on offense is Gilgeous-Alexander, who averages 32.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 6.2 assists a night. His herky-jerky drives into the paint are nightmares for opposing defenders, and he\u2019s equally skilled getting to the rim as he is stepping back for a 3-pointer or getting to the free-throw line.",
      "\u201cWhat makes him unique as a player is what makes him unique as a guy,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cHe\u2019s a self-made person who has forged himself into this player. He\u2019s never standing still; he\u2019s never sitting on his success. He\u2019s constantly improving and putting the work in. He\u2019s a great partner in the organization.\u201d",
      "Defensively, the Thunder are the best team we\u2019ve seen in years. Literally. Oklahoma City\u2019s defensive rating of 105.0 is the best of any team in the last five seasons. In an era when it\u2019s getting harder and harder to slow down offenses, the Thunder \u2014 armed with length and physicality on the perimeter and size in the paint \u2014 have cracked the code.",
      "And Oklahoma City does all of that with the togetherness more reminiscent of a college team. For example, if one player is being interviewed on the court after a big performance, typically the entire team will surround him so it\u2019s not just one player getting the spotlight. Sometimes the team will even start barking in unison. (\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to worry about that,\u201d Daigneault said when he was asked whether he\u2019ll ever join the woofing.)",
      "Of course, like most great teams trying to reach the mountaintop, the Thunder have had to go through growing pains. In 2023, they missed the playoffs after they failed to secure a spot via the Play-In Tournament. In 2024, Oklahoma City was the No. 1 seed in the West but lost in the second round to the Dallas Mavericks. Those experiences have been valuable learning moments for the young team.",
      "\u201cWhen you get down to those games where it could be kind of like mucky and not going as well, you have something to fall back on,\u201d Williams said when he was asked what the team took away from last season\u2019s postseason elimination. \u201cThe best teams are the ones that can find a way to win with all the little stuff that they did during the season.\u201d",
      "So far this year, Oklahoma City has built the defensive habits of a champion while maintaining a top-10 offense. Combine those factors with the Thunder\u2019s continuity amid upheaval in the West, as well as the potential to have home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, and Oklahoma City is in great position to make a run to the NBA Finals.",
      "\u201cAt the core, this is a group of great people,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cThey have great character. They love being a part of the team. They love competing together. They play for one another, and it\u2019s really refreshing and certainly a pleasure to coach.\u201d"

      "\u201cRed alert, everybody,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cIt is time to wake up. Get out. Do something.\u201d",
      "Along the way, he called billionaire Elon Musk \u201cPresident Musk,\u201d made the case that public opinion was quickly shifting against the Trump administration\u2019s agenda and gave out a congressional phone number, urging people to tell their representatives the impact of the president\u2019s new policies.",
      "Earlier in the day, Pritzker appeared on \u201cThe View\u201d in a segment that was recorded Thursday. Host Joy Behar introduced the governor, who is\u00a0widely thought to have presidential aspirations, as a \u201cfirebrand\u201d Democrat.",
      "\u201cEverything that he has done has been tearing down constitutional democracy and that\u2019s what happened in Nazi Germany,\u201d Pritzker said of Trump on the show.",
      "Pritzker\u2019s ubiquitousness comes at a moment when Democrats nationally are stumbling for their footing. In an information climate dominated by President Donald Trump and Musk, Pritzker is trying to step forward\u00a0as a leading oppositional voice.",
      "This week alone, the governor traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby for federal funding for Illinois, delivered\u00a0remarks to the pro-democracy group Democracy Forward,\u00a0and appeared on media including CNN, MSNBC and on multiple podcasts.",
      "The Nazi Germany reference on \u201cThe View\u201d echoed\u00a0Pritzker\u2019s State of the State speech last week, which\u00a0garnered national attention.",
      "\u201cMy oath is to the Constitution of our state and of our country. We don\u2019t have kings in America \u2014 and I don\u2019t intend to bend the knee to one. I am not speaking up in service to my ambitions \u2014 but in deference to my obligations,\u201d Pritzker said at the state Capitol in Springfield. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic.\u201d",
      "Pritzker has long relished playing\u00a0an attack-dog role against Trump. Last year, he sunk millions of dollars of his own money into battleground state efforts to protect abortion rights.",
      "This year, he\u2019s trolled the president\u00a0in ways big and small. He\u2019s issued warnings against authoritarianism and\u00a0threats to democracy, and accused Musk and Trump of attempting to steal private data of Americans. In January,\u00a0Pritzker announced a new policy\u00a0barring anyone tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol from becoming a state employee. After Trump took office and renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, Pritzker jokingly said he would rename Lake Michigan to \u201cLake Illinois.\u201d",
      "Pritzker is seeking to\u00a0fill a void in a Democratic Party that suffered a devastating blow in November, losing all of the battleground states to Trump. Meanwhile,\u00a0questions churn over\u00a0Pritzker\u2019s\u00a0next political steps. On Friday, he said he had not yet made a decision on whether he would seek a third term as governor next year. The billionaire already wooed the party to hold a successful Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 2024.",
      "\u201cJB Pritzker has shown a natural willingness to go toe to toe with the White House,\u201d said Jaimey Sexton, a Chicago-based Democratic strategist. \u201cIt is comfortable for him to go toe to toe, with facts and without bluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd he\u2019ll do it with a smile on his face because he\u2019s the affable billionaire,\u201d\u00a0Sexton continued.",
      "Pritzker\u2019s attacks on Trump have also drawn Republican ire,\u00a0including\u00a0from the likes of\u00a0Karl Rove, who called him \u201cover the top\u201d on Fox News after Pritzker\u2019s comments\u00a0comparing the Trump administration's actions to Nazi Germany. Trump has personally attacked Pritzker in the past as well.",
      "Pritzker is also of Ukrainian descent, and at the close of his event in Chicago, he\u00a0immediately posted\u00a0a rebuke of Trump on X: \"President Trump\u2019s simpering fealty to Vladimir Putin and Russia is embarrassing and dangerous. Illinois stands with Ukraine, and so should the White House.\"",
      "Asked on Friday how the governor can break through to the public when Trump has successfully dominated with messaging that ultimately won over voters in November, Pritzker pointed back to the public and noted the response to the early days of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe messaging isn\u2019t something we\u2019re making up and selling out there. It\u2019s not a campaign,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThere is anger out there.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been an enormous shift. A big shift from the beginning of this administration only 39 days ago,\u201d Pritzker continued. \u201cA big shift in people demanding that Donald Trump carry out what he said he would do during his campaign and people understanding that he\u2019s not doing that, and we gotta stop it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "Happy Friday! Somehow it is already the last day of February. In today\u2019s edition, we break down the fallout at home and abroad from today\u2019s White House meeting between Donald Trump, JD Vance and Volodymyr Zelenskyy that devolved into a shouting match.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "The Oval Office showdown heard round the world",
      "A White House meeting that was intended to kick off negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals devolved this afternoon into a remarkable confrontation, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn\u2019t grateful enough to the United States, Rebecca Shabad and Nnamdi Egwuonwu report.",
      "The Oval Office shouting match has for now shattered hopes for the minerals deal, which Trump and his allies had presented as an important step forward for Ukraine on the road to peace with Russia more than three years after the war began.",
      "A White House official told NBC News that Trump and other U.S. officials felt disrespected and asked Zelenskyy to leave the White House, saying that he was not welcome back on Friday. Zelenskyy abruptly departed and a planned joint news conference between the two leaders was called off.",
      "The exchange underscored the tension that has emerged between the United States and Ukraine \u2014 along with many of its European allies \u2014 over the tougher line that Trump has taken toward the country since coming into office. (More on what this all means for Zelenskyy below.)",
      "Vance\u2019s role: As Henry J. Gomez notes, it was a comment from Vance that sparked the unexpected, full-blown, high-volume argument for the world to watch.",
      "It was a sign of how Vance, who as a senator was known for his opposition to U.S. aid for Ukraine, is asserting himself on matters of foreign policy immediately as vice president. Earlier this month, Vance made waves at the Munich Security Conference with a speech that took sharp aim at other world leaders. And on Thursday, the day before tangling with Zelenskyy, Vance mixed it up in an Oval Office meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer \u2014 albeit in a much lighter tone.",
      "A source familiar with the planning for the Trump meeting said there was no predetermined strategy for Vance to confront Zelenskyy the way he did. Vance, the source added, felt compelled to respond after finding Zelenskyy needlessly provocative in his demeanor.",
      "\u201cNo one expected Zelenskyy to come in there and act entitled,\u201d said this person, who added that the expectation was the Oval Office meeting would go off like a typical bilateral meeting.",
      "How Republicans are responding: GOP lawmakers largely rallied around Trump and Vance. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has been a staunch supporter of aiding Ukraine, said he doesn\u2019t know if Trump and Zelenskyy can \u201crepair the damage\u201d and resume peace talks.",
      "\u201cHe either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change,\u201d Graham said of Zelenskyy.",
      "A few more moderate House Republicans, though, struck a different tone. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told NBC News that the heated exchange was \u201ca bad day for America\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., called the meeting a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for both countries and said \u201cthe only winner of today is Vladimir Putin.\u201d And Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., called the day\u2019s events \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and said both sides should return to the negotiating table.",
      "How Democrats are responding: Democrats universally slammed Trump and Vance, accusing them of kowtowing to Putin. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said during an interview on MSNBC that \u201cthis is the beginning of the end. Putin starts not only walking all over Ukraine, but walking all over Europe.\u201d",
      "An earlier meeting Friday between Zelenskyy and senators was \u201cvery bipartisan and very supportive,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said. Asked about the more rancorous tone in the Oval Office, Whitehouse said: \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for letting Vance in the room.\u201d",
      "Follow live updates \u2192",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s dilemma on display in Oval Office clash",
      "The heated clash between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office has raised new questions about the prospects for peace in Ukraine. And it underscored the dilemma facing Zelenskyy as he tries to end his country\u2019s three-year war with Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy has tried to stress the need for American support, while also warning that Ukraine must be involved in any peace negotiations and that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted.",
      "When I sat down with Zelenskyy earlier this month, he made it clear that the stakes are high.",
      "\u201cIt will be very, very, very difficult,\u201d Zelenskyy said when asked if Ukraine could survive without U.S. military support. \u201cAnd, of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance, low chance to survive without support of the United States.\u201d",
      "And the Ukrainian president seemed to choose his words carefully during our interview when asked if Trump was negotiating in good faith, saying, \u201cI hope so. Yes, I count on it. I count on it very much.\u201d",
      "But today, Zelenskyy was defiant, with tensions between him and Trump reaching a boiling point at the White House.",
      "The confrontation left more questions than answers about the path forward for peace in Ukraine. Will the U.S. still be involved in any potential ceasefire negotiations? Can those talks succeed if the U.S. is not involved? And could Ukraine lose the U.S. as an ally?",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to think that we will not be strategic partners,\u201d Zelenskyy told me earlier this month. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it because it will make a pressure on morale \u2014 morality of Ukrainians and it will be worst thing from the very beginning of the war.\u201d",
      "Today\u2019s Oval Office clash also raises questions about the future of U.S. alliances with its traditional European partners, many of whom rallied around Ukraine.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed solidarity with Ukraine in social media posts after the meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron said, \u201cI think we were all right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago, and to continue to do so. And when I say \u2018we,\u2019 I mean the United States of America, the Europeans, the Canadians, the Japanese and many others.\u201d",
      "We will explore all of this and more on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this Sunday with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.",

    "story": [
      "The West Texas measles outbreak continues to grow, now possibly spreading into the central part of the state and neighboring New Mexico, health officials said Friday.",
      "The Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed there have been 146 cases of the highly contagious virus since the outbreak, centered in Gaines County, began in late January. Twenty people have been hospitalized and one child has died.",
      "Parts of Central Texas have been monitoring for measles cases ever since an infected person traveled from Gaines County to San Marcos and San Antonio over Valentine\u2019s Day weekend.",
      "The person visited the University of Texas at San Antonio campus and a variety of restaurants and convenience stores like Buc-ee\u2019s in other areas near the city.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that this person could have come in contact with, if not hundreds, thousands of our community residents, as well as visitors,\u201d Anita Kurian, San Antonio Metropolitan Health District Deputy Director of Communicable Disease, said at a media briefing Friday. \u201cWe are a destination city.\u00a0We have real great concern of potential large community wide exposures at these public sites.\u201d",
      "In a separate briefing Friday, Katherine Wells, director of public health for Lubbock\u2019s health department, said most of the community is vaccinated, although because measles is so contagious, they are reaching out to families and closely monitoring schools for more infections.",
      "\u201cI do expect to see additional cases,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very nervous about getting a measles case in a school or a day care. We are closely monitoring that.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at both the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and the city\u2019s Health Authority, cautioned that people may not know if they\u2019ve been exposed. The incubation period is seven to 14 days. The earliest symptoms are a cough, a runny nose and conjunctivitis, or red, watery eyes, followed by sore spots in the mouth and a high fever of 103-104 degrees. A rash typically begins on the scalp or face and works its way down the body, he said.",
      "People are infectious \u201cfrom four days before the rash appears until four days after the rash,\u201d said Cook. \u201cThen it\u2019s another 10 days to get over the disease.\u201d",
      "Kurian said her office is getting up to 80 calls a day from people who are concerned about their exposure to measles in San Antonio. It could be at least a week until cases reveal themselves.",
      "\u201cWe expect to see any cases coming out of these exposures by March 8,\u201d she said.",
      "Most or all of the hospitalized patients have been children. Kids who have been admitted are either extremely dehydrated or are having serious trouble breathing, Cook said during the briefing Friday.",
      "Small children have tiny airways that can\u2019t easily handle the massive amounts of inflammation caused by measles, he said.",
      "Most of the cases are unvaccinated children, including a school-age child who died on Wednesday.",
      "Health officials are also trying to figure out if nine\u00a0measles cases in neighboring New Mexico, announced previously, are linked to the Texas outbreak.",
      "Cases unrelated to the current outbreak have also popped up in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City and Rhode Island.",
      "The origin of the West Texas outbreak, which is believed to have started within a close-knit Mennonite community, is unknown, Wells said Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have an answer anytime soon,\u201d she said, noting that other outbreaks in recent years have come from \u201ca U.S. citizen or someone traveling out of the country and bringing it back in.\u201d",
      "While measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world, it\u2019s controlled by widespread use of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) in a population. Two doses of the shot are 97% effective in preventing the disease, and the vast majority of U.S. kids get them as the CDC has long recommended: one dose around age 1, and another around age 5.",
      "As vaccine hesitancy has increased over time, fewer kids are getting their shots. The vaccine exemption rate in Gaines County was nearly 18% for the 2023-24 school year, according to\u00a0health department data.",
      "There are no vaccine mandates or forced quarantines in the communities affected by the current measles outbreak. There is, however, free testing and vaccinations being offered.",
      "\u201cWe learned lots of lessons during Covid,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe can\u2019t force anybody to take a drug. That\u2019s assault.\u201d",
      "Cook said he expects the outbreak will grow in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a huge wildfire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a smoldering fire, a tumbleweed fire, for a while until we finally get it stopped and put out.\u201d",
      "Late Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted its first public statement about the outbreak. According to the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services is \u201cproviding technical assistance, laboratory support, vaccines, and therapeutic medication as needed to the Texas Department of State and Health Services.\u201d",
      "The CDC said that vaccination \u201cremains the best defense against measles infection.\u201d Early in the outbreak, state health authorities in Texas asked for 2,000 extra doses of the MMR vaccine, which were provided by the CDC.",
      "There is no specific treatment or antiviral drug for measles. Doctors mainly try to keep patients hydrated and help them get enough oxygen."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:49:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The CDC put out a statement on the measles outbreak and suggested that vitamin A could be used for supportive care. Is vitamin A effective for measles?",
    "story": [
      "More than one month into a major measles outbreak in western Texas that has sickened 146 people and killed one school-age child, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released its first public statement and it highlighted a therapy that has raised some eyebrows among infectious disease experts.",
      "\u201cMeasles does not have a specific antiviral treatment,\u201d read the statement, which was posted only on X on Thursday night. \u201cSupportive care, including vitamin A administration under the direction of a physician, may be appropriate.\u201d",
      "Dr. Lara Johnson, a pediatrician and the chief medical officer at Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where measles patients from the current outbreak are being treated, didn\u2019t comment on whether the hospital is using vitamin A.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t comment specifically about the care of our patients; however, our physicians have followed recommended treatment protocols for patients with measles,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Vitamin A is involved in many functions in the body including vision, growth and immunity. For years, it\u2019s been used for severe measles cases in children in developing countries, where vitamin deficiencies are common. In those cases, studies have found it can reduce complications and the risk of death, though it\u2019s not seen as a cure for the disease. It\u2019s also been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization in children hospitalized with measles.",
      "\u201cVirtually, all the studies have been done in resource-limited countries where it does seem to show a significant beneficial effect, and also in those countries, it\u2019s been shown that children with lower levels of vitamin A tend to have more severe measles,\u201d said Dr. Camille Sabella, director of pediatric infectious diseases at Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s, who added that he welcomed the CDC\u2019s support of vitamin A.",
      "Vitamin A is less commonly used for measles cases in the U.S., according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. Doctors say one reason may be that most Americans have enough vitamin A in their diet.",
      "\u201cI think the big caveat of all of this is that there\u2019s a significantly higher rate of vitamin A deficiency in developing countries,\u201d said Dr. Alexandra Yonts, infectious disease specialist at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. \u201cSo it is less clear whether there is any benefit in populations like in the U.S. and other developed countries.\u201d",
      "Dr. Bernard Camins, medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, agrees that it\u2019s unclear if vitamin A would have the same benefits in the U.S. but says there\u2019s little harm in giving it at appropriate doses.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s necessarily dangerous to give it, especially if you give it the right dose and if used in the right setting,\u201d Camins said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something doctors will prescribe if someone comes down with measles to help survive.\u201d",
      "But, he added, vitamin A isn\u2019t effective for preventing measles.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m really worried about is what happened with Covid,\u201d he said, when some people \u201cwere just taking anti-parasitic agents or whatever, instead of the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Getting that message wrong is a major concern of doctors. Anti-vaccine influencers and organizations, including new Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have for years rallied around vitamin A as protection against and treatment for measles. During outbreaks, anti-vaccine groups have organized drives to fundraise and send vitamin A to affected communities.",
      "\u201cThere are examples of other outbreaks where that falsehood has spread through communities, the idea that vitamin A can be used as an alternative to MMR vaccination, and that is not the case,\u201d said Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.",
      "\u201cWhat I would have loved to see added in the CDC\u2019s statement is that vitamin A is never an alternative to MMR vaccination for measles prevention,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cI think that clarity is really, really important.\u201d",
      "Adding to the concern is that vitamin A is toxic at high levels. It\u2019s a fat-soluble vitamin, so it\u2019s stored in the body instead of released through urine. The more you take, the more it accumulates in organs like the liver.",

    "story": [
      "This year\u2019s Oscars race has been one for the books. It\u2019s been a time to recognize the work of some of Hollywood\u2019s finest and to celebrate first-time and historic nominations.",
      "But it seems that amid this history-making season, there\u2019s been an equal amount of controversies. Many of the best picture nominees have been mired in headlines that have nothing to do with the movie.",
      "Here's what to know about the Oscars race we can't look away from.",
      "All the ways the 2025 Oscars movies faced controversy",
      "One movie takes the award for most-nominated \u2014 and most controversial. Netflix's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d officially holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for a non-English language film.",
      "Garnering 13 nods, including ones for best picture, best director, best actress and supporting actress for Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Zoe Salda\u00f1a, respectively, the film beat out previous record holders such as \u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u201d (2000) and \u201cRoma\u201d (2018).",
      "The Spanish-language musical crime thriller, written and directed by Jacques Audiard, follows a criminal defense attorney (Salda\u00f1a) who helps a Mexican cartel leader (Gasc\u00f3n) disappear so he can transition into a woman.",
      "While there were some mixed reactions to the film, including GLAAD, who called it \u201ca step backward for trans representation,\u201d the film received mostly positive reviews from critics, including the New York Times, which said Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s performance added \u201csoul to the melodrama.\u201d",
      "But in late January, less than three months after its release, Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s rise as an award show favorite was quickly halted after a journalist shared some of her past tweets online, which many deemed offensive. Following the backlash, the actor issued an apology through Netflix and gave an interview to CNN Espa\u00f1ol Feb. 2, addressing her past comments and noting that she used her social media \u201cmore like a diary\u201d than as a platform with influence. Some felt that the actor didn\u2019t take full accountability for her actions, including the film's director, who told Deadline Feb. 5 that Gasc\u00f3n was \u201cself-destructive\u201d and needed \u201cspace to reflect and take accountability for her actions.\u201d",
      "While Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s past tweets and her recent responses to the backlash have cast a shadow over the film and her buzz-worthy portrayal, the actor\u2019s indiscretions weren\u2019t the only thing about \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d that have caused controversy.",
      "Some viewers have questioned why Audiard, a French man who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish, served as director. Others, like Mexican actor and singer Mauricio Mart\u00ednez, criticized the director\u2019s self-admitted lack of research about the country and its people while making the film.",
      "Other criticisms surrounding the film included the perceived dismissal of Mexican culture by not casting Mexican actors in most of the lead roles and Selena Gomez\u2019s Spanish language skills, among other issues pointed out by viewers.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n isn\u2019t the only first-time best actress nominee that has caught flak for past or recent behavior. \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d Oscar nominee Fernanda Torres, who plays a mother coping with the disappearance of her politician husband, also recently made headlines after a 2008 clip of her in blackface resurfaced online.",
      "In a statement to Deadline Jan. 26, Torres apologized for appearing in blackface, saying she was \u201cvery sorry\u201d and that at the time \u201cthe awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn\u2019t yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil.\u201d The actor\u2019s apology followed her best actress Golden Globe win in early January and her best actress Oscar nod, which made her the second Brazilian actress (after her mom, Fernanda Montenegro) to ever be nominated for that award. If she wins, she would make history as the first Brazilian actress to take home that Oscar.",
      "\"Anora\" had a controversy of its own. First-time Oscar nominee Mikey Madison, who plays a stripper who falls for the son of a Russian oligarch, received backlash after her comments for her decision not to use an intimacy coordinator on set.",
      "\u201cIt was a choice that I made,\u201d Madison said in a conversation with Pamela Anderson for Variety\u2018s Actors on Actors. The actor said she was offered the option of an intimacy coordinator by the film\u2019s director, Sean Baker, and his wife, producer Samantha Quan, but she and her co-star, Mark Eydelshteyn, \u201cdecided that it would be best just to keep it small. We were able to streamline it, shoot it super quickly.\u201d",
      "Some fans online took issue with an intimacy coordinator being a choice and not a \u201cmandatory requirement\u201d on set, while others felt her comments could \u201clead to other directors thinking intimacy coordinators aren\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Baker had previously told Variety that keeping \u201cactors safe, protected, comfortable and involved in the process\u201d was his team\u2019s No. 1 priority on set, but still some argued that Madison was \u201cmanipulated\u201d into not using one.",
      "It\u2019s not just films with best actress nominees that have been put through wringer this award show season. \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which landed 10 Oscar nominations, including a best actor nod for its star Adrien Brody, has sparked a slew of backlash for its use of artificial intelligence.",
      "The movie, which follows a Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor who struggles in the U.S. until a wealthy client recognizes his talent as a visionary architect, used AI to digitally alter the Hungarian accents of actors Brody and Felicity Jones, neither of whom speaks Hungarian natively. Though the film\u2019s director, Brady Corbet, went on to defend his use of AI in the movie in a statement to Deadline, some fans said the use of the technology diminished the film\u2019s \u201cauthenticity.\u201d",
      "Another major contender, \u201cConclave,\u201d which received a best picture and best actor nomination for Ralph Fiennes, caused a bit of a stir among Catholics. Centering around scandals and power struggles within a fictional papal conclave, the film ignited a holy, or rather unholy, debate about the film being \u201canti-Catholic propaganda,\u201d as some Catholic publications put it.",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, the bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, shared his criticism of the film on X, calling it an \u201cirredeemable situation\u201d and advising others to \u201crun away from it as fast as you can.\u201d His sentiments, which were viewed over one million times, were also reflected by various conservative commentators who said Catholics should be upset with the film.",
      "Then, just as some of the online chatter about the controversies surrounding this year\u2019s nominated projects appeared to quiet down ahead of the award show on March 2, a new controversy concerning \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d director Ali Abbasi emerged just days after Oscar voting ended on Feb. 18.",
      "After multiple outlets reported that Abbasi was dropped by his talent agency and management after an alleged groping incident that reportedly happened at a Golden Globes party, Abbasi took to X to address the reports and apologize for his actions.",
      "\u201cI made an over-familiar gesture \u2014 a slap on the rear \u2014 which I intended as playful and not in any sexual way whatsoever,\u201d he wrote in part. \u201cI quickly realized I had misjudged the situation. I apologized to him on the spot, and the following day I made sure my apology was reiterated through my representatives.\u201d",
      "He also refuted reports that he was \u201cdropped\u201d by his representation \u201cdue to this interaction.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy decision to part ways was a long-term career decision that was not shaped by short motivations. I believe in taking accountability for my actions; I made a mistake, I apologized and have learned a valuable life lesson,\u201d he added.",
      "Abbasi\u2019s film, which follows Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power as a real estate mogul in the \u201880s under the mentorship of lawyer Roy Cohn, landed two Oscar nods, one for Sebastian Stan as Trump and one for Jeremy Strong, who portrayed Cohn.",
      "How the 2025 Oscars also were a landmark for history-making representation",
      "Amid the onslaught of controversies, there\u2019s a silver lining to the Oscars this year: there\u2019s a big opportunity for some major history to be made.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n became the first openly trans actress to receive an Oscar nomination. This year also marks the first time four Latino performers were nominated in Oscar acting categories \u2014 Gasc\u00f3n, Salda\u00f1a, Torres, and Colman Domingo.",
      "Domingo, who was nominated for his portrayal of Bayard Rustin in \u201cRustin\u201d last year, also has an opportunity to become the first Afro-Latino to win the best actor Oscar for his performance in \u201cSing Sing,\u201d a prison-drama that follows incarcerated men who take part in a theater arts rehabilitation program.",
      "Meanwhile, Cynthia Erivo, nominated for her portrayal of Elphaba in \u201cWicked,\u201d has the potential to become the youngest EGOT winner, or winner of an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.",
      "She already has a 2016 Tony for her role as Celie in Broadway\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d a 2017 Grammy for best musical theater album for \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and a 2017 Daytime Emmy for her performance on TODAY with the cast of \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d",
      "The film, which follows the complicated friendship of two witches, marks the third time Erivo has had a shot at the coveted honor; she received a best actress Oscar nod for \u201cHarriet\u201d in 2020 and another nod for best original song for \u201cStand Up\u201d from the same film.",
      "While it's uncertain if Erivo will take home the Oscar on Sunday night, the singer talked about the tough lessons she's learned along the way during her acceptance speech at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards on Feb. 27. She compared her journey to Elphaba's and encouraged the audience \u2014 filled with Black women \u2014 to recognize their value regardless if others acknowledged or honored them for it.",
      "\"Elphaba's journey as a woman seen as different and cast aside for the very thing that makes her unique speaks to the heart of every Black woman who has ever been judged and misunderstood and yet still learned that her power was a gift or love,\" Erivo said. \"So I thought that I, Cynthia, would speak to your hearts. I wanted to take this opportunity as more than an opportunity to accept this beautiful award and honor, and I wanted to use it as a way to affirm you all.\"",
      "She continued, \"You weren't insane when you were dreaming of being a superhero. You weren't asking too much when you wanted to be seen for the lead. When you were little and you believed you could fly, that wasn't a fairy tale. When you look at the mirror and the thought crosses your mind, if only for a fleeting moment that you might be in possession of power for magic entertainment thought, do not dismiss it. Nourish it, because it's real.\"",
      "Essence's annual soiree, which celebrates the cinematic achievements of Hollywood's finest, including Teyana Taylor, Raamla Mohamed, Marla Gibbs, and the Uptown Honors Hollywood Awards are examples of culturally significant events during Oscars week that  continue to highlight and celebrate actors and creatives in a way that big award shows don't.",
      "Jeff Friday, founder of ABFF Ventures and annual events like the American Black Film Festival and ABBF Honors, said that these type of celebrations not only acknowledge the history-making achievements of those in the industry but they put their culture and what they represent at the forefront.",
      "\"I think it's really up to us. Instead of asking questions like, 'Why don't we get the validation and celebration we deserve?' I think it's really up to us to invest in our own celebration,\u201d Friday told TODAY.com during the Uptown Honors Hollywood Awards on Feb. 26. \"Our message and our mission is more about economic empowerment ... It's about investing in your own culture.\"",

I feel like an adult for the first time,\" she says. \"For me, I feel like this big ball of Play Doh, where I'm so excited for the unknown.

    "summary": "Andrea Davis Pinkney talks her children's book \"And She Was Loved\" about American novelist Toni Morrison.",
    "story": [
      "Toni Morrison was a giant in the literary world, both in her work as an author of Pulitzer Prize-winning tales and as a Random House editor bringing Black voices into publishing.",
      "To children\u2019s book author Andrea Davis Pinkney, Morrison was also a \u201cmentor, a guide, and a sister friend,\u201d she recalls in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "Now, Pinkney is honoring Morrison\u2019s legacy with an illustrated children\u2019s book about late novelist. \u201cAnd She Was Loved,\u201d which takes its title from a line in Morrison\u2019s \u201cSong of Solomon,\u201d was published Jan. 7.",
      "\u201cI want to pay the highest tribute to someone who meant so much to me, personally and professionally, who meant so much to so many other authors and emerging talent, and still does today,\u201d Pinkney says, describing the book as a \u201cpraise poem, a love letter, a thank you and an invitation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a full-circle moment for Pinkney, given how her relationship with Morrison began. The two collaborated on Morrison\u2019s books for children starting in 1991, where Pinkney had the formidable task of editing a literary icon.",
      "\u201cHaving grown up reading Toni Morrison as a child, being in a home where her books were everywhere, and then now working with her to create books for the next generation of readers \u2014 you can imagine how powerful and meaningful that was,\u201d Pinkney says.",
      "Pinkney was \u201ccompletely awestruck\u201d the first time she met Morrison, greeting her at the entrance of the publishing house and bringing her into the office. Morrison had a \u201cregal presence,\u201d Pinkney recalls.",
      "Unsure of what to say to her literary hero, Pinkney \u201cbabbled\u201d and tried to bond with Morrison through her daughter\u2019s name, Chloe \u2014 as Morrison was born Chloe Anthony Wofford Morrison.",
      "She was similarly nervous about actually editing Morrison's work. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine what a tall order it is to edit the work of Toni Morrison. I would have a quivering pencil,\u201d she says.",
      "But the nerves and quivers subsided, Pinkney says, as the two women began their \u201cwholly collaborative\u201d relationship. \u201cThat had to go away so we could make some great books,\u201d she says.",
      "Morrison\u2019s approach to children\u2019s literature was similar to her works for adults, like \u201cBeloved\u201d and \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Pinkney says.",
      "\u201cToni Morrison was just a master storyteller and she was very committed to inviting young people into narratives. She wanted to reach out a hand and invite them in,\u201d she says.",
      "Pinkney says Morrison would handwrite her children\u2019s books, as she did her adult books. Periodically, Pinkney would receive installments via fax machine.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to embrace you and show you that you have worth. You have agency. You have dignity \u2014 you\u2019re never alone, because here we are.\u201d",
      "What Andrea Davis Pinkney says books told her as a child",
      "\u201cShe had a very curly, artistic, calligraphic handwriting, She would then call me and say, \u2018Andrea, go to the fax machine.\u2019 Out of the fax would come this waxy paper with her handwriting on it. We\u2019d line them up and like a beautiful mosaic, that is how the narratives for young people came together,\u201d she says.",
      "Their connection goes deeper than their working relationship. In Morrison, Pinkney found someone whose story arc echoed her own.",
      "Growing up, both women were integrated into their elementary schools and were the only Black students in their first grade classrooms. Pinkney describes the feeling of being the only Black student  in first grade as \u201canxious apartness,\u201d or the feeling that \u201cyou are completely alone in the world.\u201d",
      "During this time, Pinkney found solace in books and stories. \u201cThey said, \u2018Come. You belong here,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe're here to embrace you and show you that you have worth. You have agency. You have dignity \u2014 you're never alone, because here we are.\u201d",
      "After working in publishing, Pinkney, like Morrison, became an author. She learned from Morrison to wake up early (very early \u2014 think 4 a.m.) to better convene with the \u201cmuse.\u201d",
      "She specializes in children's books, linking pivotal moments in history with beautiful illustration \u2014 often from her husband, award-winning illustrator\u00a0Brian Pinkney (though \"And She Was Loved\" was illustrated by Daniel Minter).",
      "Minter's artwork is a \u201cvisual ode\u201d to Morrison \u2014 and the covers tell a deliberate story about Morrison's philosophy.",
      "\u201cToni Morrison was committed to representing, rendering and celebrating Blackness,\u201d Pinkney says. \u201c(On the cover), she's looking right at us. When you peel off the case cover, there she is again. We, as a people, must always be front and center. We must show our faces. We must show up. We must look at you.\u201d",
      "With her book, Pinkney hopes to capture what Morrison provided for her readers and what books meant to Pinkney as a girl. \u201cThe title means everything to me. Toni Morrison left all of us that feeling of love,\u201d she says.",
      "It's fitting that Pinkney's last conversation with Morrison before her death in 2019 was about the importance of books for children.",
      "\u201cShe said something about the importance of giving young people enjoyment \u2014 lifting them up through the enjoyment of a story,\u201d she says.",

      "As \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d fans have come to expect, quite a few love triangles popped up that caused some contestants to declare their feelings and others to doubt their connections.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Vanessa and Nick Lachey, who host the U.S. version of the show, explained why so much of this season unfolds in the pods.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t just come in guns blazing going, \u2018We need to get engaged,\u2019\u201d Vanessa Lachey said of the cast. \u201cThey really pulled back the curtain, if you will, and peeled back the layers of themselves and the couples to really get down to it.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey said this season's geographical location impacted the vibe of the cast and couples, too.",
      "\u201cMinnesota is totally Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different pool of people here. So, every season\u2019s different. And I think what people will find in this particular season is that it\u2019s very, very ... I don\u2019t want to say\u00a0sweet, but it\u2019s more, it\u2019s more heartfelt.\u201d",
      "By the end of Episode 6, five couples agreed to get married, sight unseen, while two pairs realized that they weren\u2019t ready to move onto the next part of the experiment.",

      "Devin Buckley and Virginia Miller hit it off in the pods after learning that they both attended the same Minnesota high school. But, Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, was a student at the school a few years after Virginia, a 34-year-old healthcare recruiter, graduated and the two had never crossed paths.",
      "While in the pods, Devin also formed a connection with Brittany Dodson, but the relationship fizzled out when she realized he was too \u201crigid\u201d and didn\u2019t seem like the ideal partner. He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "In Honduras, Virginia and Devin continued to get along but had a minor disagreement when they moved in together. After the couple visited their separate apartments and spoke about their future, Virginia suggested that they sign a prenup to establish financial boundaries. She explained that they should each be entitled to the assets they had before meeting each other. Devin was caught off guard and seemed hesitant to agree.",
      "When Devin introduced Virginia to his family, he mentioned the possible prenuptial agreement. His family, particularly his sister Kayla, questioned the idea and wondered if Virginia was already doubting if the marriage would work.",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",
      "They also bonded over their love of Christmas. In Episode 5, they gifted each other Christmas ornaments and stockings and marveled over their similarities. \u201cThe Christmas thing means a lot to me,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut even if it wasn\u2019t Christmas stuff, I feel like we were meant to find each other.\u201d",
      "Taylor replied that Daniel made her feel \u201cvery special, very loved and very important.\u201d She then told Daniel that his words to her were the nicest things anyone has ever said to her.",
      "In Episode 6, he read her a letter explaining why he loved her. \u201cAll I want to do is make you feel safe and make you happy for the rest of your life,\u201d Daniel said. He then knelt on one knee and proposed.",
      "\u201cI would love to marry you!\u201d she cheered.",
      "Episode 6 ended on a cliffhanger as all the optimism and excitement Daniel and Taylor shared after meeting each other came to a screeching halt. After the face-to-face reveal, Taylor told the cameras she had an eerie feeling that she recognized Daniel. She spiraled, recalling that a social media user who looked like Daniel briefly followed her on Instagram before she left to film the show.",
      "She met Daniel and voiced her concerns, explaining that she worried he already knew facts based on her profile and used the prior knowledge to woo her. He said he couldn't remember following her and that her description didn't exactly match his account. To confirm the truth, she scrolled through a list of Instagram users who had previously followed her. When she couldn't find his name, she apologized. He was understanding and said he still wanted to take the trip with her Honduras.",

      "While her parents were welcoming and invited Joey to participate in their family jam session, Monica's older sister, Nicolle, quietly eyed Joey from her seat. When she pulled Monica to have a private conversation outside, Nicolle mentioned that Joey wasn't her sister's usual type. She also said that as the older sister she always felt she would get married first.",

In Episode 2, Sara, a 29-year-old oncology nurse, asked Ben, a 28-year-old developer, about growing up in a Christian household. He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said. When she asked directly about BLM, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not one way or the other. I just kind of keep out of it.\u201d",
      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",

      "Sara and Ben continued to progress until the two had an uncomfortable conversation at the end of Episode 9. She gasped twice after learning that a woman on TikTok posted a video calling out some of the \"s----- men\" on the Season 8 cast, without identifying the male cast members.",
      "Ben, who had already seen the video, said, \"I think she is referencing me.\" He also shared that he blocked the user and she blocked him.",
      "When Sara pressed him to further explain the situation, he said he hadn't spoken to the woman in over four years and that he was \"uncertain\" about what else she would reveal. He added that she was \"overreacting.\" Sara cautioned him that if he wasn't being forthcoming then the trust between them would be broken.",
      "In Episode 10, the couple meets Sara's sister and her partner, who express worry and skepticism over her sister's new relationship.",
      "\u201cI see that you have a strong connection, but this is not real right now,\u201d Lisa, Sara's sister, told her.",
      "Sara appears to hold firm. \u201cBen is such... like, we are so aligned in so many ways,\" she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Ben because I felt we were the same person. I chose Ben because he made me feel so special, and I felt energized and loved and important.\u201d",

Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",
      "Dave then met with Lauren. She said although they had some tough conversations she appreciated that they were open with each other and were able to move past everything.",
      "He agreed and said, \u201cYou easily could have bailed. I just can\u2019t thank you enough for your patience because it helped me come to terms with a lot of other things. And not being afraid to go after the girl that I really want to be with. I\u2019m so in love with you.\u201d",
      "He proposed and she quickly accepted. \u201cI love you so much, too. I\u2019m excited to just start a future with you,\u201d she said.",
      "In the pods, Dave repeatedly mentioned that his sister\u2019s opinions of his partners played a big role in his past relationships. Although fans still haven\u2019t met her, the weight of her apparent disapproval and the mistrust of Dave\u2019s friends negatively impacted his romance with Lauren in the second group of episodes.",
      "As soon as Dave and Lauren returned to Minneapolis, he complained that friends and family members learned about his engagement before he told them. Then, Dave revealed that an acquaintance claimed he had been dating Lauren up until she left to go on \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d Lauren denied his timeline of events and said that she had ended their casual fling. She said that the acquaintance wanted to create drama.",

      "Speaking to the camera after the breakup, Dave said he felt like he \u201clet her down\u201d because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t get over my own ego.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove is blind but I don\u2019t think marriage is,\u201d he said.",

Madison didn\u2019t appreciate that Alex wasn\u2019t more comforting toward her.\u00a0 After their tense conversation, Alex said he could see a future with her but he was worried they would struggle with communication and disagreements. \u201cI think at this point, it\u2019s a pretty big jump. We\u2019re not at a point to get engaged,\u201d he said.",
      "Madison tearfully departed the pods and left the experiment.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Alex said he had no regrets over ending the relationship.",
      "\"I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen,\" he said.",
      "His decision came down to attachment style and conflict resolution, as it appeared in the pods. \"I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "After navigating a love triangle in the \"Love is Blind\" dating pods, Dave Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien got engaged and jetted off on a romantic getaway. But their bliss was short-lived.",
      "Soon enough, talk of exes fueled jealousy and confusion, leading to a 'he said, she said' debate that dominated the couple's experience during the dating experiment.",
      "Were Dave and Lauren able to move past the conflict and make it to the altar? We're recapping the highs and lows of their \"Love Is Blind\" journey.",
      "What happened between Lauren and Dave in the pods?",
      "Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, instantly connected with Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, when they started talking in the dating pods.",
      "From the get go, Dave admitted that his job in medical aesthetics colored his views of beauty.",
      "\"I've been a very shallow person. I used to try to dance around that a little, but I just have. And that obviously has not worked. I really don't want to be that way at all. I know I'm way better than that,\" he said during one of their dates.",
      "Lauren understood and noted that physical attraction can grow the more you get to know someone.",
      "While he was building a bond with Lauren, Dave was also developing feelings for Molly Mulaney, a 30-year-old executive assistant.",
      "Soon enough, Dave told Molly he was going to pursue things with Lauren. It wasn't long before Dave declared his love for Lauren and proposed. She gladly accepted, then the newly engaged couple met in person for the first time.",
      "What happened between Lauren and Dave in Honduras?",
      "After getting engaged, Lauren and Dave traveled to Honduras for a romantic getaway. While they were out on a boat ride one day, the topic of Lauren's dating history came up.",
      "When Dave said he had mutual friends with two of Lauren's exes, she said they were never official boyfriends. However, Dave struggled with the fact that his fianc\u00e9 was talking with another man shortly before appearing on \"Love Is Blind,\" especially since he hadn't had a girlfriend in four years.",
      "Lauren said she still continued to date while waiting to hear if she was selected for \"Love Is Blind\" Season 8, adding that she would have backed out of the show if she met someone she really loved. However, she said the man she was seeing before filming started wasn't \"her person.\"",
      "Dave explained that he had trouble understanding how Lauren was ready for marriage after seeing another man so recently.",

      "In Episode 10, Dave didn't come home after going out with friends. Per Lauren, he texted her in the middle of the night to say he was going to stay at his apartment.",
      "\"With Dave, I'm frustrated that he's saying he wants to continue figuring thing out but then he leaves ... And I'm the one who's not ready for marriage?\" she said in a confessional interview.",
      "The couple smoothed things over the next day when Dave returned, but Lauren said her parents were concerned she might \"get hurt.\"",
      "Dave's sister was concerned about his engagement",
      "In the pods, Dave kept mentioning that his sister's opinions of his romantic partners were important to him. Once he and Lauren returned to Minnesota, this dynamic caused friction in their relationship, especially since Dave's sister was worried that he'd end up with someone who appeared on \"Love Is Blind\" for the wrong reasons.",
      "While the couple was bowling one night, Lauren expressed her frustration with the influence Dave's sister's opinions had on him.",
      "\u201cI just feel bad cause my sister, she just didn\u2019t expect me to get this far or keep it going. I kind of led her to be like, \u2018It\u2019s not going to.\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018Why are you lying to me? Why don\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d he explained.",
      "Lauren thought their relationship could be remedied if Dave brought her more into his life.",
      "\u201cOur relationship is going be better when your sister meets me, when your friends meet me. And we\u2019re going to get stronger and be able to focus on us when that\u2019s not a piece of it,\u201d Lauren replied.",
      "But did his family want to meet her? Iffy, Dave said. \"My family, they don\u2019t meet just anyone. I don\u2019t want to waste her time either,\u201d Dave replied.",
      "\u201cOK, if you don\u2019t want to waste your sister\u2019s time meeting me, if you don\u2019t see it with me, I want to know. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep doing this,\u201d she said.",
      "Their breakup unfolds in Episode 11. What they said, exactly",
      "Dave and Lauren's tense conversation continues into Episode 11, with Dave suggesting that Lauren \"probably didn't expect\" to fall in love with someone who knew her most recent ex.",
      "\"You admitted you never ended it and you should have ended it,\" he said.",
      "\"That's not what I said. I said there was not a lack of closure in my opinion,\" she replied.",
      "\"That's not what I heard. You said, 'I should've ended it. I don't know why I didn't.' And this is where I'm having a hard time. It went from that to saying it really wasn't that serious. That's where my lack of trust is coming into play. I had to ask \u2014 you didn't tell me about it,\" Dave said.",
      "Lauren admitted that she \"hooked up\" with her recent romantic partner a week before filming \"Love Is Blind.\" She then addressed why this man was texting her when they returned from Honduras, saying he \"had a different interpretation of our time.\"",
      "\"Now I'm getting frustrated because on Sunday you literally said, 'I don't give a s--- about who you hooked up with before this.' And now we're coming back to it,\" she said.",
      "At this point, Dave brings up his off-camera meeting with Lauren's dad, who didn't want to be recorded.",
      "\"Yeah, we're coming back to it because of the way your dad approached me saying that he thought I was there just to see what happens and you were fully ready for this engagement, get married in six weeks deal,\" Dave replied.",
      "\"I don't understand why this is on my family when your sister didn't want you to get engaged. Your dad didn't even know that there was an engagement,\" Lauren replied.",
      "Eventually, the couple agreed that they had a strong connection but should go their separate ways.",
      "In a confessional interview, Dave said he felt like he \"let her down\" because he \"couldn't get over my own ego.\"",
      "\"Love is blind but I don't think marriage is,\" he said.",
      "In her own private interview, Lauren said, \"I'm really sad this didn't work out. I'm so incredibly sad about it. I'm also pissed that he let it get here.\"",
      "Lauren and Dave got closure at a group event",
      "In Episode 11, several Season 8 cast members got together. Dave and Lauren snuck away for a serious discussion during the event.",
      "Dave admitted that he's \"really bad at\" admitting that he's wrong.",
      "\"It just sucks and it's not you. That's the thing about all of this. It's not you. I'm so sick of having to try to defend you versus my friends versus my family. I don't care about that. It's my fault. My ego got in the way of really seeing what we had. I guess what I'm saying is I'm really sorry,\" he said.",
      "\"I have been giving 150% the last week to try to figure things out with you and you've not given me that ... You were giving me nothing. You were giving me no validation. You were not letting me in in any capacity,\" she replied.",
      "At the end of the conversation, Dave acknowledged that their love was \"real\" and admitted that that \"freaks him out.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry that you're going through all of the feels of this. I want to believe it so badly and a lot of me does. But it's just hard to believe. I think we're past that,\" she said."

    "summary": "What are books by Black authors that have been banned? Read on for a list of banned books, why they were banned and what the authors have said.",
    "story": [
      "Book banning has increased across the country in recent years, according to data from two organizations dedicated to advocacy against censorship, but the practice of book banning in the United States dates back to the 1600s.",
      "The first known banned book was Thomas Morton's \"New English Canaan,\" a book published in 1637 that was banned by the Puritan government for its criticisms of their customs, according to a research guide from Harvard Graduate School of Education's Gutman Library. Outright bans enacted by the American government continued in the 1870s with the federal Comstock Act, which banned the distribution of writings that were \u201cobscene, lewd, or lascivious\u201d on the grounds of ensuring public morality.",
      "Today, book banning typically refers to the practice of removing or limiting access to materials from school or public libraries.",
      "Between 2022 and 2023, the American Library Association (ALA), a nonprofit that promotes the value of the library and librarians to the public, reported a 65% increase in the number of titles that were challenged for removal, marking a record high ever documented by the association.",
      "The trend has continued. From January to August 2024, the ALA tracked 414 attempts to limit access to more than 1,000 unique titles. PEN America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to free expression, meanwhile, reported more than 10,000 instances of book bans for the 2023-2024 school year.",
      "Book banning doesn\u2019t involve making materials completely unavailable for public consumption. Court cases have held that the First Amendment protects a \u201cright to receive information.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re saying that a book is being challenged in a community, and if the decision is made by the board to remove it, then they\u2019re saying that that\u2019s a ban on accessing that material through that library. But that doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s the only way that someone can access information,\u201d ALA President Cindy Hohl says.",
      "According to the ALA, a book ban occurs when material is removed from a library after a person or group objects to it. A ban is often initiated by a challenge, which refers to the attempt to remove it from public access.",
      "PEN America takes a broader approach, defining a school book ban as any action that results in access to a book being \"restricted or diminished, either temporarily or permanently.\"",
      "What both organizations share is the goal of tracking where access to books is being disrupted \u2014 a task that's easier said than done.",
      "\"We rely upon libraries and library professionals to report these matters directly to ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom,\" Hohl says. \"So we believe that there is a matter of under-reporting because many of the book challenges aren't even submitted to us or covered by the press.",
      "We continue to see this trend where (book bans are) specifically targeting Black, Indigenous, people of color, whether it's the author themselves, or it's the characters in the storyline... Who has the right to decide whose voice should have a place in American literature?",
      "cindy hohl",
      "\"When we look at the data that's compiled, it really only represents a snapshot of book censorship attempts,\" she adds.",
      "What the available data does show is that book banning disproportionately affects Black and Indigenous writers and authors of color, as well as authors from the LGBTQ+ community, Hohl says.",
      "Ranging from classics, including the works of James Baldwin and Toni Morrison, to modern young adult books like \"The Hate U Give\" and \"The Poet X,\" books by Black authors have been impacted by bans for decades.",
      "The censorship of diverse voices can also come about by individual people's choices \u2014 for example, unilateral censorship by a library worker, which the ALA defines as a librarian excluding materials for display or purchase \"without consulting anyone.\"",
      "Quartez Harris is the the author of \"Go Tell It,\" an illustrated biography of James Baldwin, whose works have been repeatedly banned across the U.S. He's also a former second-grade teacher. During his time as a teacher, while books weren't explicitly banned at his school, he says he witnessed what he calls \"quiet banning,\" or indirectly keeping books from readers.",
      "\"A lot of teachers didn't really feature books that reflected our students' lived experiences. We were a predominantly Black school, but a lot of the literature did not depict our demographic,\" Harris says.",
      "Book banning has also become just one part of \"more extreme\" attempts at censorship, Sonya Douglass, a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, says. Classrooms around the country face challenges on what they can teach and the terminology used, she says. In 2021, school districts across the country faced battles over what can be taught about race and gender. Nine states enacted laws limiting instruction of critical race theory \u2014\u00a0a framework that looks at how racism is systemic \u2014 that year, per NBC News.",
      "\"(Book banning is) now, I think, even being overshadowed by a lot of the efforts to just limit the opportunity to teach about race, racism and the truth of American racism,\" Douglass says.",
      "A lot of teachers didn't really feature books that reflected my our students lived experiences. We were a predominantly Black school, but a lot of the literature did not depict our demographic.\u201d",
      "Quartez Harris",
      "Jewell Parker Rhodes, whose book \"Ghost Boys\" has faced bans, says the experience has been triggering.",
      "\"I have trauma from the banned books themselves,\" Rhodes says. \"I've been teaching African American literature for decades... When you lose the voice of the African American literature, you lose the voice of African American people.\"",
      "To push back against censorship, Harris encourages readers to \"challenge these baseless claims that books are harmful. Books make people better.\"",
      "Here are banned books by Black authors across genres to celebrate Black History Month all year-round.",
      "Classics",
      "\"The Color Purple\" by Alice Walker",
      "Alice Walker's 1982 epistolary novel tells the story of a young Black woman named Celie through the letters she writes to God about her experiences in early 1900s Georgia. \"The Color Purple\" has consistently made the American Library Association's list of most frequently challenged books, coming in at No. 17 for the 2000-2009 list and No. 50 for 2010-2019, primarily for its sexual and racial content.",
      "Walker, now 81, spoke about attempts to censor \"The Color Purple\" in a 2012 interview with Guernica magazine and said, \"I remember feeling, and understanding, the fear that drove some parents in the schools to wish to ban 'The Color Purple.'\"",
      "\"Many people of course condemned 'The Color Purple' unread. Some read the first five pages and decided they were doing society a service by silencing the voice of a 14-year-old uneducated Black girl whose only language was what she\u2019d heard in her community, where people rarely spoke in euphemisms,\" she continued.",
      "\"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison",
      "Toni Morrison is another author whose work often makes the ALA's list of frequently challenged books, including her classic titles \"The Bluest Eye\" (the No. 10 most frequently challenged book of 2010-2019) and \"Beloved\" (No. 26 on the same list). \"The Bluest Eye,\" which follows a young traumatized girl who wishes to have \"blue eyes,\" has been banned for its depiction of child abuse and focus on racism. \"Beloved,\" about a family of formerly enslaved people who are being haunted, has also been banned for its violent content. Morrison edited a 2009 anthology of essays about censorship called \"Burn this Book\" and wrote, \u201cFear of unmonitored writing is justified \u2014 because truth is trouble.\"",
      "Andrea Davis Pinkney, the author of children's books like \"The Red Pencil\" and \"Sit-In,\" also worked with Morrison to edit her children's books. Pinkney says Morrison taught that times of \"dread\" is \"the exact moment that artists need to get to work.\"",
      "\"This is the moment where we get on the path, we stay in the work, and we tell the stories, because that's what's gonna endure at the end of the day. That's what will last,\" she says of Morrison's wisdom. \"And you can't ban that.\"",
      "\"Native Son\" by Richard Wright",
      "Richard Wright\u2019s \"Native Son\" follows Bigger Thomas and the catastrophic chain of events that occur after he accidentally kills a white woman. While \"Native Son\" does not make light of Bigger\u2019s crimes, some of the book\u2019s wider themes explore the effects systemic racism may have had and the hypocrisy of the justice system. Although Wright\u2019s work is considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it has been banned in multiple school districts for language, sexual content and violence.",
      "\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" by James Baldwin",
      "James Baldwin's \"Go Tell It On the Mountain\" is about a teenager's complex family dynamics and his relationship with the Pentecostal Church. The book has been banned at least twice for its profanity and sexual content, according to PEN America.",

Among the cast, which TODAY exclusively announced in June, were \u201cBig Brother\u201d legends Danielle Reyes and Britney Haynes, deceptive \u201cSurvivor\u201d winners Tony Vlachos and Jeremy Collins and reality television favorites Chrishell Stause and Gabby Windey.",

      "Dorinda Medley",
      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",

      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",

Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\"",
      "Tom Sandoval",
      "Episode 10 began with the sole remaining Traitor successfully recruiting a new ally before the two secretly escaped to the turret to weigh their options for the next murder. They agreed that Tom Sandoval was close to figuring out their identities and needed to go. When the \"Vanderpump Rules\" star spotted a letter from the Traitors, he immediately let out a maniacal chuckle. \"I knew it!\" he said before reading that he had been eliminated from the game. \"I was expecting this. Who's the most threatening of the guys? Obviously me,\" he theorized. He added, \"I've enjoyed this so much and I didn't realize I was going to be so good at it. It's kind of f---ing cool.\" Tom then applauded himself for how he played the game and how the other players perceived him. \"Overall, I was a pleasure to work with, for the most part, and valued, respected and that's all I could ask for,\" he concluded."

    "story": [
      "When HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Pitt\u201d premiered in January, it drew immediate comparisons to another medical drama, \u201cER.\u201d",
      "Both shows are set in busy urban hospitals and follow frontline healthcare workers as they grapple with a series of intense traumas in the emergency room.",
      "\u201cThe Pitt\u201d even stars a familiar face: Noah Wyle, who played Dr.  John Carter in \u201cER,\u201d portrays protagonist Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch in the new show.",
      "The new series also marks an \u201cER\u201d reunion behind the camera, bringing back \u201cER\u201d producers John Wells and R. Scott Gemmill.",
      "The apparent similarities between the two series are at the heart of an ongoing legal dispute between the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d and the estate of the late author Michael Crichton.",
      "Crichton, who is also known for writing the novels that inspired \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and \u201cThe Andromeda Strain,\u201d wrote the original screenplay for \u201cER\u201d in 1974 and served as an executive producer on the show until his death in 2008.\u00a0The medical drama ended in 2009.",
      "Now, Crichton's estate is alleging in a lawsuit that \u201cThe Pitt\u201d was created as a sequel to \u201cER\u201d without the permission of the late author\u2019s heirs.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d meanwhile, insist their show is not an \u201cER\u201d reboot, arguing that it is \u201cno more similar to \u2018ER\u2019 than is \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\u2019 \u2018Chicago Med,\u2019 or any of the countless other hospital medical dramas that have aired since or before \u2018ER.\u2019\u201d",
      "Keep reading to learn more about why Michael Crichton\u2019s estate is suing the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d and where the case stands now.",
      "Why is Michael Crichton's estate suing 'The Pitt' creators?",
      "In August 2024, the estate of the late author Michael Crichton sued the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d on three counts, including breach of contract.",
      "The plaintiffs allege that the HBO medical drama, which premiered in January, is an unauthorized reboot of \u201cER,\u201d which was created and executive produced by Crichton and ran from 1994 until 2009.",
      "Warner Bros. Television, showrunner R. Scott Gemmill, executive producer John Wells and the star of \"The Pitt\" Noah Wyle, who also serves as a writer and executive producer for the series, were among those named as defendants.",
      "According to the complaint, the defendants began working on an \u201cER\u201d reboot in 2020, planning for it to air on HBO Max. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants worked on the reboot \u201cwithout any notice\u201d to Crichton\u2019s widow, Sherri Crichton, and in \u201cbrazen disregard\u201d of the contractual rights of the late author\u2019s estate.",
      "When he created \u201cER,\u201d Crichton was granted a \u201cfrozen rights\u201d provision in his contract that would prohibit Warner Bros. Television from \u201cproceeding with any sequels, remakes, spinoffs, or other productions derived from \u2018ER\u2019 without Crichton\u2019s express consent,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "The complaint alleges that the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d revealed to Crichton\u2019s widow in 2022 that they had been developing an \u201cER\u201d reboot, two years after they began working on the project.",
      "After negotiations stalled with the studio, Crichton\u2019s estate refused to give consent for the planned reboot, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cWithout (the Plaintiff\u2019s) consent, Defendants\u2019 work on an ER reboot should have ended,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \u201cBut Defendants\u2019 efforts did not end.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit argues that \"The Pitt\" is essentially a re-creation of \"ER,\" but with an altered setting and character names.",
      "The complaint alleges that Noah Wyle, who also starred as Dr. John Carter in \u201cER,\u201d plays essentially the same character, this time named Dr. Michael Robinavitch, in \"The Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cNoah Wyle\u2019s character is Dr. John Carter from 'ER' in all but name, only 30 years later, and imbued with the experience and lessons learned during the 15-year run of the original series,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The complaint also alleges that the two shows share striking similarities when it comes to their hospital settings, structure and supporting characters, noting that \u201cthe main character\u2019s co-worker/ friend in both series is a roguish bad boy.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also notes that \u201cThe Pitt\u201d is executive produced by John Wells, who served as an executive producer on \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Pitt is \u2018ER.\u2019 It\u2019s not like \u2018ER,\u2019 it\u2019s not kind of \u2018ER,\u2019 it\u2019s not sort of \u2018ER.\u2019 It is \u2018ER\u2019 complete with the same executive producer, writer, star, production companies, studio, and network as the planned \u2018ER\u2019 reboot,\" the lawsuit states. \"No one has been fooled.\"",
      "The lawsuit called the defendants\u2019 actions \u201clegally and morally repugnant\u201d and, in the case of Wells, \u201ca personal betrayal of a 30-year friendship.\"",
      "\u201cDefendants seek not to bury Crichton\u2019s credit but to erase him altogether and to rob his heirs of the fruits of one of his greatest creations,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cPlaintiff will not allow that to happen. Defendants must be held accountable to Crichton and other creators whose rights are too often trampled upon in pursuit of unrelenting greed.\u201d",
      "What have the creators of 'The Pitt' said?",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d have fought back against the lawsuit.",
      "On Jan. 31, Warner Bros. Television and the other defendants filed a motion to have the lawsuit dismissed under California\u2019s anti-SLAPP law.",
      "The purpose of an anti-SLAPP motion is to quash frivolous legal claims that are brought to \u201cchill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech,\u201d according to the statute.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d argued that making of the show was a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech,\u201d according to a ruling by the Superior Court of California in February.",
      "Producers Gemmill and Wells have not commented publicly on the lawsuit, but they have opened up interviews about how they believe \u201cThe Pitt\u201d differs from \u201cER.\u201d",
      "Gemmill said he and his fellow creators wanted to \u201cfind a way to do it that was fresh for both us and the audience so that we weren\u2019t just retreading what we\u2019d done in the past,\u201d as he told Variety on Jan. 23.",
      "He added that he had no desire to re-create \u201cER.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I was going to do another medical show, it would have to be completely different and new, because I don\u2019t want to do the same thing over again,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the audience \u2014 I mean, there are some who would (want to revive \u2018ER\u2019) for nostalgia\u2019s sake, but that\u2019s no fun for me and I don\u2019t know how much fun it is for Noah (Wyle).\u201d",
      "Wyle said in the same joint interview with Variety that in his view, \u201cThe Pitt\u201d and \u201cER\u201d are stories told from different angles.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, \u2018ER\u2019 was a patient-centric show, and this is more of a provider-centric show, which puts the focus of the medicine and the current way that it\u2019s practiced in first position,\u201d he said.",
      "In a November statement, Warner Bros. Television called the lawsuit\u2019s claims \u201cbaseless.\u201d",
      "\u201cMs. (Sherri) Crichton\u2019s lawsuit against WBD lacks both factual and legal foundation. Ms. Crichton\u2019s description of the timeline and content of our negotiations about a potential \u2018ER\u2019 reboot are incorrect, and we strongly deny her allegations,\u201d the studio said, as reported by Deadline in November.",
      "\u201cImportantly, 'The Pitt' does not include any 'ER' intellectual property and is no more similar to \u2018ER\u2019 than is 'Grey\u2019s Anatomy,' 'Chicago Med', or any of the countless other hospital medical dramas that have aired since or before \u2018ER\u2019,\u201d the statement continued.",
      "Casey Bloys, the head of HBO\u2019s Max streaming service, also rejected the allegation that \u201cThe Pitt\u201d is based on \u201cER\u201d in comments at a press conference in November, according to Variety.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not supposed to talk about active litigation, but I will say the idea that a show can\u2019t be set in an ER seems kind of unrealistic on its face, that no other show can be set in a hospital emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s kind of a staple on television.\u201d",
      "Sherri Crichton responded to Bloys\u2019 remarks in a Deadline interview the same month, calling them \u201cnot credible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe case is not about whether someone can do a show set in a hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is about whether Warner Bros., John Wells, Noah Wyle, and Scott Gemmill can spend two years developing an 'ER' reboot, negotiate with the estate for nearly a year to obtain consent per Michael Crichton\u2019s contract, and, when they can\u2019t get the terms they want, proceed with the exact same show with a different title and location.\u201d",
      "Where does the case stand now?On Feb. 24, a judge denied the defendants\u2019 motion to throw out the complaint, meaning that the lawsuit can move forward.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Wendy Chang of the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles said the Court agreed that the making of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d is a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech.\u201d",
      "However, the Court also found that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were not \u201ctotally meritless\u201d and could not be dismissed, meaning that legal proceedings can continue.",
      "The ruling states that the plaintiffs did \u201cestablish a timeline of various communications and events to show the negotiations with the Estate over an \u2018ER\u2019 reboot, failure of those negotiations, and the creation of \u201cThe Pitt.\u2019\u201d",
      "A case management conference is now scheduled for March 26 in Los Angeles."

      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"The White Lotus\" Season Three.",
      "The opening credits of \"The White Lotus\" Season 3 might give away more information than just the cast and crew's names. Fans think the art has clues into the characters\u2019 fates \u2014 and some of the actors this season do, too.",
      "Jason Isaacs, who plays father of three and businessman Timothy Ratliff in the third season of the hit HBO show, brought up the meaning behind the opening credits this season in an interview with some of his castmates aired on TODAY on Feb. 12.",
      "\"Someone said to Patrick (Schwarzenegger) and I the other day that during the credits when each individual name comes up, did you notice that the drawing behind it means something about their character?\" Isaacs asked.",
      "Sarah Catherine Hook, who plays Tim's middle child Piper in the show, said the illustration accompanying her name directly corresponded with her character.",
      "\"Mine was meditating,\" Hook said. \"I was like, 'That's Piper.'\"",
      "Isaacs started laughing and replied, \"We didn't notice any of this at all.\"",
      "While the cast of the \"White Lotus\" are aware of what the illustrations could mean (or could not mean), fans have began posting their own theories on social media.",
      "One TikTok, which has more than 350,000 views, offered five minutes of analysis of the opening credits, from character illustrations to how Season Three's credits could connect to the credits (and plot lines) from Season One.",
      "Kelly Cahn, an art advisor, curator and appraiser, shared more insights about the opening credits in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\"I feel like they're literally showing us the entire thing in advance,\" Cahn said of the opening images, which were hand drawn by Plains of Yonder.",
      "The 'White Lotus' Season 3 credits, analyzed by an art expert",
      "The paintings shown in the opening credits are inspired by Thai mural paintings, which can be found in temples and royal palaces in Thailand, Cahn said.",
      "She noted that several paintings throughout the credits, including the one featured in the first few seconds, appear to be on top of panel that is behind the ones that are visible, meaning we might not be seeing the full, bigger picture.",
      "\"Like, there's some story that's a cover up or something,\" Cahn said.",
      "The first actor's name to appear is Leslie Bibb. The letters are surrounded by an illustration of several elephants \u2014 creatures known for having a remarkable memory.",
      "Cahn said at first she saw three elephants \u2014 which could correspond to the trio Bibb's character is with on the trip \u2014 but then could potentially see four, possibly hinting at more to come for their group.",
      "The illustration for Carrie Coon, who plays another one of the three women on vacation together, also features an elephant, though it's surrounded by a pack of animals as two winged creatures look on from above.",
      "\"There's almost a sense of you're being watched,\" Cahn says of the painting. \"Are these things that can fly away and report back? Again, it feels like an attack. Lying in wait, watching.\"",
      "Walton Goggins is the next name to appear after imagery of a palace or temple. His illustration shows a man sitting in a tower looking down below, which Cahn said could hint at his surveillance of the owners of the hotel.",
      "As Hook said on TODAY, her name is shown with a woman who appears to be meditating on a hill, and her character Piper is a Buddhist.",
      "Before Isaacs' name is alongside a man hiding in a tree (\"perhaps from the incriminating press,\" Cahn said). Above him in the tree are hanging knives or swords \u2014 which could be a sign of incoming danger for the father of three, Cahn said.",
      "And in Episode 2, Tim's business partner Kenny (voiced by Ke Huy Quan) tells him that the feds have raided his office. Kenny then warns Tim that they have everything on their business dealings in Brunei, which Tim implies could be tied to money laundering.",
      "The image for Blackpink singer Lalisa Manobal, who plays Mook, seems to show a woman holding an umbrella and flirting with a man, Cahn said.",
      "\"In the first episode, she is trying to convince her partner to go after more lucrative bodyguard positions that would enable them to travel,\" Cahn noted of Mook.",
      "Michelle Monaghan, who plays the third woman vacationing in Thailand with her two best friends, has a topless woman on a balcony in the image alongside her name.",
      "Sam Nivola, who plays one of Tim\u2019s sons Lochlan, shared on TODAY that the illustration beside his name is just a boy lying down \u2014 but he did give the show\u2019s creator Mike White some room for interpretation with the opening credits.",
      "\u201cWhat if he\u2019s just like, screwing with us all?\u201d Nivola asked.",
      "Cahn analyzed the painting as a boy in his underwear floating in the water, perhaps showing a direct line to who could end up dead in the water at the end of the series.",
      "But as Nivola himself said on TODAY, it all could be a red herring as well.",
      "Lek Patravadi, who plays the owner of the hotel, is shown with a woman seated in a lotus position holding a bird with a human head in her hand, Cahn said.",
      "Parker Posey's image shows two monkeys sitting together, one of which is blowing smoke, which Cahn said could allude to the Southern mom's dependence on prescription drugs.",
      "After Posey's name, the credits cut to an alligator looking in the distance, and then pans over to a heron or crane looking at its reflection in the water.",
      "Natasha Rothwell's name pops up, which Cahn said could relate to the myth of Narcissus, or even her ability to see Gary as Greg.",
      "\"Or perhaps it deals with the self-reflection she will be undertaking during her 3 months in Thailand,\" Cahn said.",
      "Two men appear to be peeping watching a topless woman (a possible reference to the image from Monaghan's name, Cahn noted) from afar in some trees in the next section \u2014 as Patrick Schwarzenegger's name comes up.",
      "\"Patrick Schwarzenegger is clearly, like, the guy that would be leering through the bushes,\" Cahn said, referring to his character Saxon. \"I feel like he instantly tries to hit on (women), and they're like, 'What?' ... it feels like this kind of peeping Tom energy.\"",
      "Tayme Thapthimthong, who plays the hotel's bodyguard Gaitok, has a man fighting a tiger alongside his name, while a cow or ram watches from above, Cahn said.",
      "A large cat has attacked another animal alongside Aimee Lou Wood's name, while two other animals look on and watch. Cahn questioned if Wood's character Chelsea is the attacked animal \u2014 or if she could be the feline itself.",

      "Two monkeys appear to be crawling up a tower as the Thailand casting director Non Jungmeier's name is shown, and four people are at the top of the tower as costume designer Alex Boivard's name comes into the frame. One person is holding a snake towards the monkeys, Cahn noted.",
      "The next few scenes show what could be an attack on a place, before a boat appears to capsize, and some of the crew are eaten by large fish, Cahn said.",
      "The last image is of a man paddling on a log while another fish looks on, as White's name is credited as creating the series.",
      "The credits end with an ornate red temple with a Buddha in the middle, which Cahn said could be an allusion to the hotel owner's husband.",
      "Whether Lochlan ends up floating the water, or if the tree of knives falls on Timothy, still remains to be seen. But the theories as to who dies at the end of Season 3 of \"The White Lotus\" are just getting started.",

      "In an earlier interview, Hackman revealed that he didn't feel comfortable giving Christopher advice.",
      "\u201cI lost touch with my son in terms of advice early on,\" Hackman told GQ in 2011. \u201cMaybe it had to do with being gone so much, doing location films when he was at an age where he needed support and guidance.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A White House meeting that was intended to kick off negotiations on a deal over Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals devolved Friday afternoon into a remarkable confrontation, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance chastising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and telling him he wasn\u2019t grateful enough to the United States.",
      "\"He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website after the meeting ended. \"He can come back when he is ready for Peace.\"",
      "The Oval Office shouting match has for now shattered hopes for the minerals deal, which Trump and his allies had presented as an important step forward for Ukraine on the road to peace with Russia more than three years after the war began.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "A White House official told NBC News that Trump and other U.S. officials felt disrespected and asked Zelenskyy to leave the White House, saying that he was not welcome back on Friday. Zelenskyy abruptly departed the White House and a planned joint press conference between the two leaders was called off.",
      "After departing the White House, Zelenskyy posted on X, \u201cThank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.\u201d",
      "The exchange underscored the tension that has emerged between the United States and Ukraine \u2014 along with many of its European allies \u2014 over the tougher line that Trump has taken toward the country since coming into office. He has called Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" and falsely said that Ukraine, not Russia, started the war.",
      "Hours after the meeting, Trump told reporters that Zelenskyy \u201coverplayed his hand,\u201d accusing the Ukrainian president of \u201clooking to go on and fight, fight, fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for somebody that\u2019s going to sign up a strong power and then not make peace because they feel emboldened,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to go into a 10 year war and play games. We want peace.\u201d",
      "The skirmish in the Oval Office Friday began after Vance said that the path to peace between Russia and Ukraine is diplomacy. Zelenskyy disagreed, noting that Russia had broken agreements with his government in the past.",
      "\"He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners,\" Zelenskyy said about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "\"I\u2019m talking about the kind of diplomacy that\u2019s going to end the destruction of your country,\" Vance shot back, adding, \"I think it\u2019s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media right now.\"",
      "Vance has long opposed U.S. aid to Ukraine. As a senator, he voted against a $95 billion foreign aid package that included substantial funding for Ukraine. As a Senate candidate, Vance said in a 2022 podcast, \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d",
      "When Vance told Zelenskyy on Friday that Ukraine has \"manpower problems\" in recruiting troops, Zelenskyy challenged Vance, noting he had never even been to his country.",
      "\"I've actually watched and seen the stories,\" Vance responded. \"And I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President.\"",
      "\"Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?\" he added.",
      "Zelenskyy said that everyone has \"problems\" during the war and suggested that the U.S. doesn't feel the effects of the war because of the \"nice ocean\" between the two countries. He said the U.S. may not feel the effects now, but added, \"You will feel it in the future.\"",
      "\"Don't tell us what we're going to feel because you're in no position to dictate that,\" Trump said, raising his voice and pointing his finger at Zelenskyy. \"You're not in a good position.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III,\" Trump said. \"And what you\u2019re doing is very disrespectful to the country \u2014 this country.\u201d",
      "\"I've empowered you to be a tough guy,\" Trump said. \"And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave, but you're either going to make a deal or we're out, and if we're out, you'll fight it out.\"",
      "Trump and Vance repeatedly suggested that Zelenskyy was not thankful enough to the United States for its assistance.",
      "\"You're not acting at all thankful, and that's not a nice thing,\" Trump said at one point.",
      "\"Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting?\" Vance also asked.",
      "Zelenskyy has repeatedly thanked the United States for its help. In Dec. 2022, he spoke before both chambers of Congress and his first words were: \"Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. It\u2019s too much for me. All this for our great people. Thank you so much. Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart.\"",
      "Republican allies of the president largely applauded Trump after the meeting. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., an outspoken critic of Putin who has supported U.S. aid to Ukraine, called the meeting a \u201ccomplete, utter disaster,\u201d\u00a0and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Graham \u2014 who attended a bipartisan group of senators\u2019 meeting with Zelenskyy earlier Friday \u2014 said the Ukrainian leader \"either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Trump and Vance\u2019s handling of the meeting stunned Democrats, who said that they were kowtowing to Putin.",
      "\u201cWhat we saw in the Oval Office today was beyond disgraceful. Trump and Vance berating Zelenskyy \u2014 putting on a show of lies and misinformation that would make Putin blush \u2014 is an embarrassment for America and a betrayal of our allies. They\u2019re popping champagne in the Kremlin,\u201d wrote Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who was also part of the meeting with Zelenskyy Friday morning.",
      "Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said during an interview on MSNBC that \"this is the beginning of the end. Putin starts not only walking all over Ukraine, but walking all over Europe.\" Trump has \u201ccompletely thrown out American tradition, Republican tradition, everything they\u2019ve run on for decades just to be beholden to Putin.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy's visit had been expected to focus in large part on a potential deal for the U.S. to access Ukraine's rare-earth minerals, which are used to make a variety of tech products.",
      "During a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said that the two countries had made progress on an agreement that would grant the U.S. a significant ownership stake in Ukraine\u2019s rare-earth minerals as a form of repayment for Washington\u2019s support of Kyiv since Russia's invasion.",
      "U.S. officials initiated peace talks with Russian negotiators this month in Saudi Arabia, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the U.S. delegation. It was the first time Russian and American officials had met in person during the Trump administration with the express intent of bringing an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump has long accused Zelenskyy of taking undue advantage of the U.S. and goading then-President Joe Biden into spending billions of U.S. dollars on a war that \u201ccouldn\u2019t be won.\u201d",
      "The minerals agreement, Trump argued, would serve as reimbursement for the nearly $66 billion in military assistance the U.S. has provided Ukraine over the past three years, and it could create an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d between the two countries.",
      "Ukraine has some of the world\u2019s largest reserves of titanium and iron ore. Many of the minerals, however, are in areas controlled by Russian troops, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Russia has proposed a similar deal that would give the U.S. ownership of rare-earth minerals and valuable metals in Russian-controlled Ukrainian territory, an idea that both Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have signaled interest in.",
      "Zelenskyy this month rebuffed the initial U.S. offer on rare-earth minerals, saying it did not include strong enough security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "The rejection, paired with Zelenskyy's insistence that Ukrainian officials be involved in U.S.-Russia talks to end the war, drew Trump\u2019s fury.",
      "After Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian \u201cdisinformation bubble,\u201d Trump maligned him as \u201ca Dictator without Elections,\u201d arguing without evidence that Zelenskyy decided to postpone elections as Ukraine battles Russia because of low popularity numbers.",
      "Trump later told Fox News that Zelenskyy would hamstring his efforts to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you. He\u2019s been there for three years. He makes it very hard to make deals,\u201d Trump said."

    "summary": "Hamas is willing to cede political power and administrative governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is achieved.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas is willing to cede political power and administrative governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian unity government, but would not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is achieved, Basem Naim, a senior political official for Hamas, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe are ready today, if not yesterday, to step back from governance to hand it over to a body, a government, a committee, that is ready to run the Gaza Strip,\u201d Naim said.",
      "Naim made his comments during a critical impasse: The first phase of a tenuous deal between Hamas and Israel is set to end on Saturday, and no arrangements have been made for continuing the ceasefire.",
      "While there have been few publicly acknowledged negotiations to extend the truce into a second phase, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it will soon send a diplomatic delegation to Cairo to continue talks.",
      "Naim said that beyond that public announcement, Hamas had not been officially notified of Israel's intention to resume negotiations.",
      "It was unclear whether Israeli officials would seek to extend the first phase of the agreement or negotiate terms for a second phase, which could ultimately lead to a more permanent ceasefire and the eventual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Naim said Israel was deliberately delaying further negotiations to create a pretext for returning to war against Hamas.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is intentionally done to escalate the situation or to push the second-phase negotiations under the threat to return back to war and not to withdraw from the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "Israeli troops are supposed to start withdrawing from the Gaza-Egypt border area on Saturday, marking the end of the ceasefire's first phase. However, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told public broadcaster Kan on Thursday that Israel has demanded that their military stay in the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along Gaza\u2019s southern border with Egypt.",
      "The last step of the agreement\u2019s six-week first phase came overnight, when Israel released more than 600 Palestinian prisoners after Hamas handed over the corpses of four Israeli hostages killed during captivity in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Under the ceasefire\u2019s terms \u2014 which were reached with help from intermediaries Qatar and Egypt in late January, after more than a year of fraught negotiations \u2014 talks on the second stage should have begun weeks ago.",
      "But rather than returning to the negotiating table, each side has repeatedly accused the other of violating the agreement\u2019s terms. Several of the weekly exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners have been dogged by last-minute accusations and near-cancellations.",
      "Hamas has stated before that it is willing to cede governance of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body, and Israel has made clear that any plan for Gaza\u2019s \u201cday after\u201d should not include Hamas, which led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. On that day, about 1,200 people were killed and 250 were kidnapped, according to local officials, sparking Israel's 15-month war on Gaza that has killed at least 48,300 people, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, and destroyed much of the enclave.",
      "The thorniest question standing in the way of negotiating the second phase of an agreement remains whether Hamas will disarm. Netanyahu has declared Hamas\u2019 destruction as the primary goal of Israel\u2019s war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 sometimes, his critics have said, superseding the freedom and welfare of the Israeli hostages still being held there.",
      "Though he reiterated Hamas\u2019 offer to integrate into a Palestinian unity government, Basem Naim said the group would only disarm and transform into a purely political party if Palestinians are granted an independent political state \u2014 a condition that Netanyahu and his right-wing allies in government have repeatedly rejected.",
      "\u201cThese are two different tracks. The arms are related to the existence or the presence of the occupation,\u201d he said, referring to Israel's ongoing presence in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem.",
      "If an independent Palestinian state is created, Naim said, \u201cwe are ready again to become a political party and to integrate our fighters into a Palestinian national army.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 An investigation by the Israeli military has determined that Hamas was able to carry out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, because the much more powerful Israeli army misjudged the militant group\u2019s intentions and underestimated its capabilities.",
      "The findings, released Thursday, could pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch a widely demanded broader inquiry to examine the political decision-making that preceded the attack, which triggered\u00a0the war in Gaza.",
      "Many Israelis believe the mistakes of Oct. 7 extend beyond the military, and they blame Netanyahu for what they view as a failed strategy of deterrence and containment in the years leading up to the attack. That strategy included allowing Qatar to send\u00a0suitcases of cash\u00a0into Gaza and sidelining Hamas\u2019 rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.",
      "The prime minister has not taken responsibility, saying he will answer tough questions only after the war, which has been paused for nearly six weeks by a tenuous ceasefire.\u00a0Despite public pressure, including from the families of the roughly 1,200 people killed in the Oct. 7 attack and the 251 taken as hostages into Gaza, Netanyahu has resisted calls for a commission of inquiry.",
      "The military\u2019s main findings were that the region\u2019s most powerful and sophisticated military misread Hamas\u2019 intentions, underestimated its capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack by thousands of heavily armed militants in the early morning hours of a major Jewish holiday.",
      "The military\u2019s findings are\u00a0in line with past conclusions\u00a0reached by officials and analysts. The military released only a summary of the report and military officials outlined its findings.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was a complete failure,\u201d said one military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "A central misconception was that Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority in 2007, was more interested in governing the territory than fighting Israel, the inquiry found.",
      "The military also misjudged the militant group\u2019s capabilities. Military planners had envisioned that, at worst, Hamas could stage a ground invasion from up to eight border points, the official said. In fact, Hamas had more than 60 attack routes.",
      "Intelligence assessed in the aftermath of the attack has shown Hamas came close to staging the offensive on three earlier occasions but delayed it for unknown reasons, the official said.",
      "The official said that in the hours before the attack, there were signs that something was amiss, including when Hamas fighters switched their phones over to the Israeli network.",
      "The perception that Hamas did not want war guided decision makers away from taking action that might have thwarted the attack. The Israeli military official said intelligence shows that\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who was killed last October, had begun planning it as early as 2017.",
      "With the military off guard on a holiday weekend, Hamas launched a heavy wave of rockets that allowed thousands of fighters to burst through the security fence or fly over it on hang gliders. They knocked out surveillance cameras and quickly overwhelmed hundreds of soldiers stationed along the border.",
      "From there they advanced to key highway intersections and attacked troops dispatched to the area, including some senior officers, disrupting the military\u2019s command and control, according to a second military official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the first three hours after the attack, Hamas fighters marauded through border communities and a\u00a0music festival\u00a0with little resistance. That was when most of the 251 hostages were taken and most people were killed, the official said. The official said the chaos led to friendly fire incidents, although he said there were not many, without disclosing a figure.",
      "It took hours for the military to regain control and days until the area was fully cleared of militants.",
      "According to the first official, the report blamed the military for being overconfident in its knowledge and not showing enough doubt in its core concepts and beliefs. It did not place blame on any individual soldiers or officers, but is likely to pave the way for a reckoning in the military and eventual dismissals.",
      "Some high-ranking officers\u00a0have already resigned, including the former head of military intelligence and Israel\u2019s top general, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, who steps down next week."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there is \u201cvalue\u201d in an agreement that President Donald Trump is pursuing on Ukrainian mineral rights to repay some of the $500 billion in military aid that the U.S. has sent in support of the country's war against Russia.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss efforts at ending the Russia-Ukraine war and a possible trade deal with the U.S., said in an interview with NBC News that economic ties between Washington and Kyiv could be considered a form of security.",
      "\u201cI can see the value in the approach in relation to minerals,\u201d Starmer said in the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter between President Trump and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. But I can see very clearly the argument that President Trump makes in relation to minerals, and I can also see the validity of his points when he says that if there is a deal on minerals then the U.S. has economic interests in Ukraine, which, if you like, form at least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat, in its own right, is an important aspect.\u201d",
      "Trump has been vocal about his interest in settling the yearslong conflict in Ukraine and talked about compensation for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. But he has shied away from committing to any security guarantees, saying this week that he would ask Europe to take the lead on that.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump warned that if a peace deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody wants peace, everybody wants bloodshed to end. Not least the Ukrainians,\u201d Starmer told NBC News, adding that discussions were already underway on what security would look like.",
      "Asked if Britain can achieve its objectives without U.S. participation, Starmer responded that \u201cthe first thing is to get the European element in place.\u201d",
      "He said Trump \u201cis right\u201d to press for talks to drive forward a deal, while adding words of caution about Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that we know, historically, that Putin might go again,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cHe has ambitions in relation to Ukraine. And therefore, if there\u2019s to be a deal, it has got to be a deal that lasts.\u201d",
      "The Starmer-Trump meeting comes at a sensitive time for the United Kingdom as the prime minister commits to sending British troops to Ukraine to help secure a \u201clasting peace\u201d if a peace deal with Russia is reached.\u201cThe stakes, they couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Starmer said during a joint news conference with Trump at the White House. He said it was essential that Ukraine be \u201cbacked by strength that will stop Putin coming back for more.\u201d",
      "Starmer, standing beside Trump, insisted that any deal should put to rest Russian ambitions and committed to putting \u201cboots on the ground and planes in the sky\u201d to limit future incursions into Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump offered praise to Starmer, greeting him warmly at several junctures throughout the day. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting and continued their discussions on Ukraine and a possible trade deal over lunch, Trump said during the news conference.",
      "Starmer is a \u201cspecial man,\u201d Trump said, adding that they \u201cget along famously.\u201d",
      "The meeting came a day before the president is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington, as Trump hopes the U.S and Ukraine can sign an agreement on rare mineral rights.",

      "\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this deeply unnerved even our closest allies in Asia,\u201d said Green, who served on the White House National Security Council under President George W. Bush.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive dismantling of the U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid has had ripple effects abroad, according to Green. U.S. embassies are hampered by the chaos in Washington and funding for democracy programs has dried up, a potential boon for China, he said.",
      "\u201cSenior officials in Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand have told me that China is swooping in, offering to replace the United States as the partner of choice,\u201d Green said.",

      "Several representatives for nongovernmental organizations that have been affected by the USAID cuts requested anonymity to speak to NBC News while they determined how to best work with the Trump administration and dealt with the devastating directive. One spokesperson said they were afraid they could lose funding for the few remaining programs that weren\u2019t hit by Wednesday\u2019s cuts while another hoped the administration would reconsider the cuts altogether.",
      "UNAIDS, the joint United Nations program responding to HIV/AIDS globally, on Friday said it had received a letter from the administration terminating funding with immediate effect. The U.S. has been the leading contributor through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known at PEPFAR, which has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives in 55 countries since its creation in 2003, according to UNAIDS.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. funding cuts are dismantling the system,\u201d International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cHIV treatment is crumbling. TB services are collapsing. No data means no tracking of who\u2019s in care. No counsellors, no HIV testing \u2014 even in hospitals. No outreach means people fall through the cracks. Services for the most vulnerable people, including mobile clinics and drop-in centres, are shut down. Lives are on the line.\u201d",
      "Organizations combating gender-based violence are also feeling immediate impact. The International Rescue Committee, which supports civilians impacted by humanitarian crises around the world, including by providing medical care, counseling and legal assistance to thousands in war-torn Sudan, has been forced to shut down some of its operations, according to its president.",
      "\u201cHumanitarian services and lifesaving assistance in Sudan, the world\u2019s world humanitarian crisis on record, have been shut down. The programs affected include services for children with acute malnutrition, putting them at risk,\u201d said IRC President and CEO David Miliband said in a statement shared with NBC News.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Peter Marocco, the deputy administrator-designate at USAID, \u201chave determined your award is not aligned with Agency priorities and made a determination that continuing this program is not in the national interest,\u201d according to a copy of a termination notice obtained by NBC News that was sent to companies with USAID contracts Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere seems to be no pattern to it\u201d other than shutting down U.S. foreign aid, one humanitarian official said.",
      "USAID provided assistance to around 130 countries in fiscal year 2023. The top 10 recipients of aid in that year were Ukraine, Ethiopia, Jordan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria, South Sudan and Syria.",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations International Organization for Migration told NBC News that the cuts directly affect the organization\u2019s \u201cability to support some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is fighting two lawsuits challenging the dissolution of USAID and the subsequent freeze on foreign aid. One of those suits has reached the Supreme Court, with the court on Wednesday temporarily pausing a lower court order that required the administration to release frozen foreign aid funding by midnight Wednesday.",
      "There will likely be more lawsuits against the administration as a result of the termination notices, with organizations on the hook for work that\u2019s already been done, and potentially costs to wind down these programs, while the USAID payment system remains shut down.",
      "DAI, a USAID-funded international development organization that says it works in 160 countries, received termination notices for more than 90% of its contracts.",
      "As a result, the group has been forced to furlough 500 employees, according to spokesman Steven O\u2019Connor. Not only that, the government still owes DAI for work already delivered, he said.",
      "\u201cWe prefinance all that work, then we invoice the government for reimbursement; without that reimbursement, we can\u2019t pay our staff, our partners, our vendors, our creditors,\u201d he said.",
      "In the meantime, the effects are already being felt in communities that rely on that assistance for emergency relief, with trust potentially eroding between those communities and USAID and its partner organizations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard to drive this truck in reverse, because they\u2019ve washed out the road behind us,\u201d a humanitarian official said."

      "During that match in the midst of the Cold War, which he lost 12.5-8.5 despite winning the first two games,\u00a0Spassky\u00a0showed great sportsmanship, applauding Fischer after losing the sixth game.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 The owners of an island volcano in New Zealand where 22 tourists and local guides died in an eruption had their criminal conviction for failing to keep visitors safe thrown out by a judge on Friday.",
      "The ruling absolves the company from paying millions of dollars in restitution to the families of those killed in the 2019 explosion on Whakaari, also known as White Island, and two dozen seriously injured survivors. Most of the 47 people on the island were U.S. and Australian cruise ship passengers on a walking tour, along with their local guides.",
      "The company, Whakaari Management \u2014 run by three brothers who own the active volcano on New Zealand\u2019s North Island \u2014 appealed their convictions for breaching New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety law in a three-day hearing last October at the High Court in Auckland. They were found guilty in a 2023 trial.",
      "The case hinged on whether the company \u2014 which granted access to the volcano to tourism operators and scientific groups, for a fee \u2014 should have been in charge of safety practices on the island under New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety laws. Anyone in charge of a workplace must ensure the management of hazards and the safety of all there, including at entry and exit points.",
      "Survivors told the trial in emotional testimony during the company\u2019s 2023 trial that they had not been told the active volcano was dangerous when they paid to visit it. They were not supplied with protective equipment, and many were wearing clothing that made their horrific burns more damaging.",
      "In Friday\u2019s written ruling, Justice Simon Moore ruled the company did not have a duty under the relevant law to ensure that the walking tour workplace was without risks to health and safety. He agreed with the company\u2019s lawyers that the firm only granted access to the bare land through permits \u2014 and should not have been legally considered an entity that managed or controlled the workplace.",
      "The judge ruled it wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the company to rely on tourism operators \u2014 who were licensed under New Zealand law \u2014 and emergency management and scientific agencies to assess the risks of activities on the island and manage safety precautions.",
      "The case had far-reaching implications and changed the laws governing New Zealand\u2019s adventure tourism industry, which is often based on outdoor thrills on or around the country\u2019s many natural hazards. Operators must now take all reasonable steps to inform customers of any serious risks.",
      "The lawyers for the company said during last October\u2019s hearing that if the conviction were allowed to stand, it would make other landowners reluctant to allow such activities to take place on their property for fear of being held responsible for the day-to-day decisions of tourism businesses operating on it \u2014 a suggestion rejected by New Zealand\u2019s workplace safety regulator, which brought the charges.",
      "Justice Moore said in Friday\u2019s ruling that a too narrow or broad interpretation of the law governing who controls a workplace could have \u201cprofound\u201d consequences.",
      "White Island, the tip of an undersea volcano also known by its M\u0101ori name Whakaari, was a popular tourist destination before the eruption and was reached by boat or helicopter from the North Island\u2019s Bay of Plenty. When the superheated steam blew in December 2019, it killed some instantly and left others with agonizing burns.",
      "The workplace safety regulator brought charges against several parties \u2014 including the company run by Andrew, Peter and James Buttle.",
      "Six entities pleaded guilty in 2022 and 2023 to the charges they faced, including five tour companies and New Zealand\u2019s geoscience research institute, which monitors active volcanoes.",
      "Charges were dismissed against the Buttle brothers individually, along with two tourism logistics firms and the government emergency management agency.",
      "In March, those convicted were ordered to pay a combined total of just over 10 million New Zealand dollars ($5.6 million) in restitution to the bereaved families and survivors. Almost half of that was due to be paid by Whakaari Management Limited.",
      "In his ruling, Justice Moore said he had not overlooked or minimized the \u201cunquantifiable tragedy\u201d of the episode.",
      "\u201cThe 47 people who were on Whakaari at the time it erupted should never have been there,\u201d he wrote. The fact that they were revealed \u201cmultiple systemic failures.\u201d",
      "The case, however, was decided on the particular law and facts and boiled down to relatively narrow legal questions, he added."

      "PANAMA\u00a0CITY \u2014\u00a0Lawyers for\u00a0migrants\u00a0from around the world who were deported from the United States and moved to a remote jungle camp in\u00a0Panama\u00a0in recent weeks say they have been unable to communicate with their clients since they arrived there.",
      "Some 112 deported\u00a0migrants\u00a0are being held in the \u201cSan Vicente\u201d immigration center deep in the dense jungle that separates\u00a0Panama\u00a0from Colombia, according to\u00a0Panamanian authorities. Their future is uncertain as they wait to see if they will be granted asylum in\u00a0Panama\u00a0or elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIndividuals, including families like our clients, are being sent to\u00a0Panama\u00a0without any screening for asylum and despite not having any connection to\u00a0Panama,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cAnd when they get there, they are disappearing into a black box without access to counsel,\u201d he said.",
      "Gelernt is one of several lawyers challenging a Jan. 20 executive order from newly inaugurated President Donald Trump\u00a0that broadly blocked\u00a0migrants\u00a0from claiming asylum at the Mexico border.",
      "In recent weeks, the U.S. has deported some 300 people to\u00a0Panama, including people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. These flights are part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to sidestep the fact that some countries refuse U.S. deportation flights due to strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.",
      "The arrangement with\u00a0Panama\u00a0allows the U.S. to deport these nationalities and makes it\u00a0Panama\u2019s responsibility to organize their repatriation.",
      "But the process, which in this case included an interim stop at a hotel in\u00a0Panama\u00a0City where the group was\u00a0detained\u00a0by armed guards, has been widely criticized by human rights groups that worry\u00a0migrants\u00a0could be mistreated and fear for their safety if they are ultimately returned to their countries of origin.",
      "When asked at a news conference on Thursday why the\u00a0migrants\u00a0at the camp had been denied access to legal counsel,\u00a0Panamanian President Jose Mulino replied that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "When asked if he was concerned about the situation, he said \u201cYes, but isn\u2019t it curious that they have lawyers in\u00a0Panama?\u201d and did not elaborate on what he meant before ending the news conference.",
      "A State Department official said, \u201cThe governments of transit countries will make decisions about who is or is not removable from their countries in accordance with their laws and international obligations.\u201d",
      "National Immigrant Justice Center attorney Keren Zwick said she was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the safety of a Turkish woman and her daughter who were deported from the U.S. to\u00a0Panama\u00a0and have since been sent back to Turkey, according to her husband.",
      "A copy of the legal complaint against the U.S. government from the ACLU, NIJC and other rights groups \u2014 which Reuters reviewed \u2014 said the Turkish woman and her daughter told U.S. immigration officials they had come to seek asylum. They arrived to the U.S. on Feb. 3, after the Jan. 20 executive order, before being deported on a military plane to\u00a0Panama\u00a0nine days later.",
      "Neither Gelernt nor Zwick has spoken with them since they were in the hotel in\u00a0Panama\u00a0City.",
      "The woman and her husband had been involved in a religious non-violence movement in Turkey before the government issued a warrant for his arrest because of his involvement, causing him to flee the country, the complaint said. The woman then fled Turkey with her daughter after repeated incidents of harassment, the complaint said.",
      "The woman\u2019s husband told Zwick that his wife and her daughter had been deported to Turkey on Wednesday.",
      "Analysts say arrangements such as the\u00a0Panama\u00a0one are part of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to \u201coutsource\u201d its deportation plans to countries in Central America. Costa Rica has also received migrants from various nationalities that were deported from the U.S. in recent weeks.",
      "The 112\u00a0migrants\u00a0being held in the jungle camp initially refused repatriation,\u00a0Panamanian authorities say. Meanwhile President Mulino said at Thursday\u2019s news conference that 113\u00a0migrants\u00a0have already returned to their countries of origin, 16 were traveling on Thursday and 58 others are awaiting tickets for flights home.",
      "Susana Sabalza, a\u00a0Panamanian lawyer representing a family from Taiwan that is being held in the jungle camp, told Reuters she had been asking the government for over a week for access to her clients.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t normal, we have never seen this in\u00a0Panama\u00a0before,\u201d she said. \u201cI should be able to talk to my clients.\u201d",
      "Ali Herischi, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., representing 11 Iranians in the camp, said his clients were each given a three-minute phone call by the Red Cross in\u00a0Panama\u00a0on Tuesday to speak with their families, but were barred from calling their lawyers.",
      "The immediate role of Red Cross in\u00a0Panama\u00a0at the camp was recent and its personnel were authorized by authorities to provide health services and to re-establish contact between\u00a0migrants\u00a0and their families, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.",
      "\u201cOur services, which include telephone calls, have the exclusively humanitarian purpose of preventing disappearance or loss of family contact, so they are not intended for audiences other than family relatives,\u201d an ICRC spokesperson told Reuters.",
      "Two other lawyers seeking to offer representation to the deported\u00a0migrants\u00a0say they were barred access first to the hotel and now to the jungle camp, where they said authorities have also taken cellphones away from several\u00a0migrants.",
      "Vincente Tedesco, one of the two lawyers, said he attempted to offer the\u00a0migrants\u00a0legal assistance at the\u00a0Panama\u00a0City hotel but was barred entry.",
      "A week later he sent a formal request, seen by Reuters, to\u00a0Panamanian Security Minister Frank Abrego asking to clarify the\u00a0migrants\u2019 legal status and why they had been barred from receiving legal counsel.",
      "Tedesco said that he had not received a formal response.",
      "\u201cThey are violating these people\u2019s right to due process and international conventions,\u201d he added.",
      "Panama\u2019s security minister did not respond to a request for comment."

      "HONG KONG  \u2014 A Hong Kong judge on Thursday sentenced a former pro-democracy lawmaker to three years and one month in prison on a charge of riot after an incident in which he was beaten up at a subway station during the city\u2019s anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "Lam Cheuk-ting was among dozens injured when a group of men armed with wooden poles and metal rods attacked protesters and bystanders at Yuen Long train station on July 21, 2019. The attackers, wearing white shirts that contrasted with protesters\u2019 black attire, claimed they were protecting their homeland in Yuen Long, a residential district in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories.",
      "Last December, district court judge Stanley Chan convicted Lam of rioting, ruling that his words to the white-shirted men had \u201cfanned the flames.\u201d Chan rejected Lam\u2019s claim that he was acting as a mediator or protecting residents in his role as a lawmaker at the scene, saying he had tried to exploit the situation for political gain.",
      "The landmark verdict could shape the city\u2019s historical narrative of the 2019 incident, a turning point that intensified the protest movement as the public criticized police for their delayed response. About 10 white-shirted men have been convicted in other cases related to the clash in the subway station, local media reported.",
      "In Thursday\u2019s hearing, the judge said although Lam had not engaged in violent acts, his presence as a lawmaker and political figure led to a deterioration of the confrontational situation. Lam did not show remorse in his letter meant to plead for a lesser sentence, Chan said.",
      "The former lawmaker said in a letter to the judge that what he once believed was right had become wrong or even a crime.",
      "\u201cFor this, I have no resentment, no regrets. But my guilt comes from causing pain to my dear ones who raised and nurtured me,\u201d he said.",
      "In the same case, Chan also ordered six less prominent defendants to be jailed for terms from two years and one month to two years and seven months, including some who had hurled objects or shot jets of water at the white-shirted men with a hosepipe. Chan dismissed arguments that some of them were acting in self-defense in his December verdict.",
      "As Chan read out the sentences, some people sitting in the public gallery wept.",
      "Hours before the hearing, several supporters of the defendants waved at prison vans outside the court building and chanted \u201cga yau,\u201d a common phrase of encouragement in Cantonese. Lam smiled at supporters as he entered the courtroom.",
      "The 2019 protests were set off by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to the mainland for trial. The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the Chinese territory\u2019s leaders and police accountability.",
      "The social movement was the biggest challenge to the Hong Kong government since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. In response, Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, leading to the arrest of many activists. Others were silenced or went into exile.",
      "Lam is already serving a sentence of six years and nine months in the city\u2019s biggest national security case. Chan said he can serve three months of the newly given 37-month term concurrently with that sentence.",
      "Last week, the political party he belonged to took an initial step toward dissolving, another sign of the drastic political changes in the city since Beijing imposed the security law, which it said was necessary to restore Hong Kong\u2019s stability."

      "BANGKOK \u2014 Thailand deported 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers to China on Thursday, activists and Thai officials said, despite warnings from rights advocates and U.S. officials that they could face torture and imprisonment if they were returned.",
      "The Uyghurs, who had been detained for more than a decade, were part of a group of more than 300 people who were arrested in 2014 after fleeing China to seek protection in Thailand.",
      "The Chinese government denies accusations that it has committed large-scale abuses against Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic group who live mainly in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.",
      "The Thai national police chief, Kitrat Phanphet, told reporters that 40 people had been deported and that officials in China \u201cshowed the sincerity and the intention to take care of this group of\u00a0Chinese Uyghurs.\u201d",
      "The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said 40 Chinese nationals who had entered Thailand illegally had been deported, without saying whether they were Uyghurs.",
      "The deportation was carried out in accordance with the laws of both China and Thailand, the Chinese government said, adding that the legal rights of the individuals involved had been fully protected.",
      "The U.S. strongly condemned the move by Thailand, a longtime ally. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thailand risked\u00a0\u201crunning afoul of its international obligations\u201d under the U.N. Convention Against Torture and called on Thai officials to \u201cfully verify continuously\u201d that Chinese officials were not violating the Uyghurs\u2019 human rights.",
      "\u201cWe urge all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Rights groups and Thai lawmakers also criticized the Thai government, which had said earlier that it had no plans to deport the Uyghurs.",
      "\u201cWhat is the Thai government doing?\u201d Thai opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang said in a post on X. \u201cWe have violated their human rights more than enough. There must be a better resolution,\u201d he added.",
      "Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the deportation by Thailand \u201cconstitutes a blatant violation of Thailand\u2019s obligations under domestic and international laws.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe men now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance, and long-term imprisonment in China,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Responding to comments from rights groups, Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said his \u201cis a rule-of-law country with comprehensive legal frameworks and mechanisms for protecting human rights.\u201d",

      "Speaking to reporters earlier in the day before the deportation was reported by Chinese state media, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra did not confirm whether anyone had been deported.",
      "\u201cThis sort of issue, for any country, one has to follow the law, international process and human rights,\u201d she told lawmakers, according to Reuters.",
      "Thailand was previously criticized in 2015 when it deported more than 100 members of the original Uyghur group to China. Most of the rest of the group was sent to Turkey, while 53 remained in Thailand.",
      "Five of those 53 have since died, including two children, according to United Nations human rights experts. They say almost half of the remaining 48 Uyghurs were suffering from serious health conditions, including diabetes, kidney dysfunction, and heart and lung conditions.",
      "The status of the eight Uyghur detainees who do not appear to have been deported to China on Thursday was not immediately clear.",
      "Rights activists have criticized the Uyghurs\u2019 condition in Thai detention, saying they were denied access to family members, lawyers and international organizations. In a letter to the Thai government last year, U.N. experts said its treatment of the Uyghur detainees could be a violation of international law.",
      "Amid concerns that their deportation to China was imminent, the U.N. had urged Thailand not to repatriate the Uyghur detainees, saying last month that they were \u201cat real risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if they are returned.\u201d",
      "Rights groups say Uyghurs in China face discrimination and the suppression of their cultural identity. The U.S. and other Western governments have said that Beijing\u2019s policies on Uyghurs, including the forced detention of possibly a million or more people, amount to genocide.",
