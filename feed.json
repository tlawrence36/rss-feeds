      "Christian music is growing in popularity while other genres struggle to grow new listenership",
      "NEW YORK -- It is one of the most surprising music stories of the year. While streams of new music \u2014 releases from the last 18 months \u2014 were down from last year, one genre is on the rise: Christian and gospel music, according to industry data and analytics company Luminate\u2019s 2025 Midyear Report.",
      "Jaime Marconette, Luminate\u2019s vice president of music insights and industry relations, said the shift is led by acts like Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Elevation Worship, who are connecting with a \u201cyounger, streaming-forward fan base\u201d that's 60% female and 30% millennial. In fact, for the first time in 11 years, two contemporary Christian music songs \u2014 Frank\u2019s \u201cYour Way\u2019s Better\u201d and Lake\u2019s \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah\u201d with Jelly Roll \u2014 broke through the Billboard Hot 100's all-genre Top 40, placing them in direct competition with mainstream artists.",
      "It's also why traditionally secular artists like Jelly Roll, Killer Mike and T.I. are nominated in Christian music categories at the forthcoming 2026 Grammys \u2014 the lines are blurring.",
      "\u201cChristian music (is) unlike any other genre that\u2019s defined by a sonic component. Christian music is defined by its lyrical component,\u201d says Holly Zabka, the president of Provident Entertainment, a Sony Christian music subsidiary. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to a narrow definition. It\u2019s a lyrical component that can appeal to anyone\u2019s musical preference.\u201d",
      "From a label perspective, she\u2019s interested in pursuing artists that \u201cdon\u2019t have to fit within that narrow lane of Christian bookstore and Christian radio. It can be rap, hip-hop, it can be rock, it can be country, and that\u2019s appealing to a broader audience because it\u2019s what they\u2019re already listening to,\u201d she says. \u201cVery few people listen in a vacuum and only listen to one genre.\u201d",
      "But for many years, CCM jas held a reputation for being unimaginative \u2014 what writer John Jeremiah Sullivan infamously referred to as \u201cexcellence-proof\u201d \u2014 for its tendency to mimic and water down popular, contemporary mainstream sounds for a religious audience.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely there\u2019s been an improvement in quality,\u201d says Zabka. \u201cWhen all the music has to live side by side on these streaming platforms, we can\u2019t just be the cheap alternative. \u2018Oh, you like Taylor Swift? You will like this lesser version offering in the Christian genre.\u2019 We want to be the greatest art.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to imitate before you innovate,\u201d Chris Brown, singer and worship leader at Elevation Worship, jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s not as many rigid lines stylistically within Christian music as maybe there was 10 years ago or certainly like 20, 30 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was a period of time where people idealized Christian music as like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to have this look, we\u2019re going to sound like this,\u2019\u201d says two-time Grammy-winning Christian and pop musician Lauren Daigle. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more artistry now. People are very expressive. They\u2019re able to share their creativity. And that also comes with different types of people represented.\u201d",
      "Zabka says her genre is experiencing \u201ca special moment and \u2026 a perfect storm.\u201d Streaming and the ability to connect on social media have democratized music discovery, she says, allowing CCM to compete with secular music. That, partnered with what she views as \u201ca resurgence of faith\u201d in young people, is responsible for the interest.",
      "The number of Americans who identify as Christian has declined steadily for years, but that drop shows signs of slowing, according to a 2025 survey from the Pew Research Center. A new class of millennial and Gen Z Christian influencers, too, are aiming to connect with young people.",
      "\u201cChristian music has also shifted in its authenticity of the lyrics,\u201d Zabka adds, making the music more relatable than previous iterations of the genre, which often featured a neat message of \u201ceverything is going to be OK, just follow Jesus\u201d in 3 \u00bd minutes. Now, she says, \u201ctheir songs are much more authentic and real and honest. \u2018Life is hard. Breakups are hard. Bad things happen,\u2019 and that provides a level of hope that other music doesn\u2019t provide for the listener.\u201d",
      "Daigle points out that artists like Lake are performing in huge stadiums \u2014 categorical proof that Christian artists are growing in popularity.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people are looking at the world and \u2026 they find fortitude in this music, and they find a sense of strength in this music, and they find truth in this music,\u201d she says.",

      "Lake, who is nominated for three Grammys in 2026, including \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah,\u201d believes people are connecting with Christian music now because that's simply the purpose of religious music.",
      "\u201cThe reason why people are turning their ear toward those kinds of songs right now is because that\u2019s what they were made for,\u201d Lake says. \u201cPeople are finding in these songs \u2014 they\u2019re finding themselves, their spirit, connecting with the spirit of God. \u2026 Those songs aren't just entertainment; they tee up an encounter.\u201d",

      "Jelly Roll agrees. \u201cI think there really is a revival happening in America right now where people are being re-presented the Gospel in a digestible way. And it doesn\u2019t seem as finger-waggy and \u2018You\u2019re all going to hell,\u2019 you know?\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t care when the organized religions wave their finger at me,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to see the message, the Gospel getting presented.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a federal appeals court in New York late Tuesday to order his immediate release from prison and reverse his conviction on prostitution-related charges or direct his trial judge to lighten his four-year sentence.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that Combs was treated harshly at sentencing by a federal judge who let evidence surrounding charges he was acquitted of unjustly influence the punishment.",
      "Combs, 56, incarcerated at a federal prison in New Jersey and scheduled for release in May 2028, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at a trial that ended in July. Combs was convicted under the Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime.",
      "Lawyers for Combs said Judge Arun Subramanian acted like a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d in October when he sentenced Combs to four years and two months in prison. They said he erred by letting evidence surrounding the acquitted charges influence the sentence he imposed.",
      "They noted that Combs was convicted of two lesser counts, prostitution offenses that didn\u2019t require force, fraud, or coercion. They asked the appeals court, which has not yet heard oral arguments, to acquit Combs, order his immediate release from prison or direct Subramanian to reduce his sentence.",
      "\u201cDefendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses \u2014 even when coercion, which the jury didn\u2019t find here, is involved,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "\u201cThe judge defied the jury\u2019s verdict and found Combs \u2018coerced,\u2019 \u2018exploited,\u2019 and \u2018forced\u2019 his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy. These judicial findings trumped the verdict and led to the highest sentence ever imposed for any remotely similar defendant,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",

      "At the trial, former girlfriend Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura testified that Combs ordered her to have \u201cdisgusting\u201d sex with strangers hundreds of times during their decade-long relationship that ended in 2018.

    "story": [
      "The Grammys' country album category has been split into two for the 2026 award show",
      "NEW YORK -- Flashback to February. It's the 2025 Grammys, and Beyonc\u00e9 has made history. Not only was she finally awarded the top prize of album of the year, but she also became the first Black woman to win best country album, for \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d Recent changes by the Recording Academy have made it even more monumental: She might be the last person to ever win the award.",
      "In June, the Academy announced that the Grammys' country album title was splitting into two categories. A new award was created, traditional country album. The preexisting country album category has been redefined and is now contemporary country album, reflecting the genre's ongoing sonic evolutions.",
      "The decision was divisive: Some viewed it as backlash to Beyonc\u00e9's win. Others welcomed the addition of a new award and the creative doors it might open. Some questioned how the categories would be defined in a genre where the word \u201ctraditional\u201d is loaded.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the change \u2014 and what it could signify in the future.",
      "Charles L. Hughes, Rhodes College professor and author of \u201cCountry Soul,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9's victory was a welcomed surprise, despite being obviously worthy. That's because her album inspired a larger conversation about reclamation, standing in opposition to the music industry's rigid power structures and \u201cindicated how significant this historical question remains of whether or not Black folks have equal access to success in a genre of music that bears such strong Black influences and has from the very beginning,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "He believes the decision to alter the country album categories was not in direct response to her win \u2014 \u201cI think it is a more complicated story,\u201d he says \u2014 but the timing might've been less than ideal, emboldening fans to view it as reactionary. He hopes the changes will open the category to more diversity of sounds and \u201cwhether this leads to a broader opening and opportunity for Black artists, especially Black women in country music,\u201d he posits.",
      "Francesca T. Royster, a DePaul University professor and author of \u201cBlack Country Music: Listening for Revolutions,\u201d views Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s victory as positively connected to this change. She wonders if artists \u2014 particularly artists of color, who never had their music recognized in country music categories, think of artists like \u201cMillie Jackson or Candi Staton, Bobby Womack\u201d \u2014 would now see their work recognized. \u201cHaving these two categories just allows for more experimentation and maybe less of a double standard,\u201d she says, \u201cin terms of artists who are often held to higher standards to conform to, or be recognizable as, meeting an idea about what country music is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt makes sense that the Grammy categories for country would become a little bit more expansive,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think the music is more expansive and the audience is also more expansive than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "According to the Recording Academy's rule book, the traditional country category is defined by \u201ccountry recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation.\u201d",
      "Those are: acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar and live drums. This is also where subgenres like outlaw country, Western and Western swing would fit.",
      "The contemporary country category description is a bit more conceptual. The rule book states that albums eligible in this category \u201cutilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture.\u201d",
      "The hope is that those titles are \u201crelevant to the legacy of country music\u2019s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms.\u201d",
      "The questions Hughes poses: \u201cWhose tradition are we talking about?\u201d And how is \u201ccountry music's culture\u201d defined?",
      "\u201cIt's almost tautology. \u2018Well, it\u2019s traditional country if it sounds like traditional country,'\u201d he says.",
      "In that reading, contemporary country could simply account for everything else.",
      "Royster says both categories seem to \u201cspeak to an aesthetic as well as political agenda, many agendas.\u201d To her, the traditional category would appeal to artists who believe that \u201cthis is a past form that needs to ... continue to be recognized and respected.\u201d Similarly, the contemporary category is \u201clinked to the culture of country but is also expansive.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn both cases, there\u2019s a kind of story behind the story.\u201d",
      "Adding a new genre category is not unique to country music. Consider a sister genre, R&B. In 1999, the Recording Academy also introduced a traditional category to the R&B field to spotlight artists who chose to hybridize the genre as well as those who prefer nostalgic structures.",
      "It didn't stay stagnant from there: In 2021, the Academy changed the best urban contemporary album category to best progressive R&B album, to spotlight those records that weave R&B with other genres.",
      "In the contemporary country album category, Kelsea Ballerini's \u201cPatterns\u201d faces off against Tyler Childers' \u201cSnipe Hunter,\u201d Eric Church's \u201cEvangeline vs. the Machine,\u201d Jelly Roll's \u201cBeautifully Broken,\u201d and Miranda Lambert's \u201cPostcards from Texas.\u201d",
      "In the traditional category, it is Charley Crockett's \u201cDollar a Day,\u201d Lukas Nelson's \u201cAmerican Romance,\u201d Willie Nelson's \u201cOh What a Beautiful World,\u201d Margo Price's \u201cHard Headed Woman,\u201d and Zach Top's \u201cAin\u2019t In It For My Health.\u201d",
      "Royster wonders if with this first year of nominees, \u201cthere's less risk in terms of recognizing the kind of \u2018country-ness\u2019 of these artists.\u201d Royster views the lineup as \u201cartists (whose) country creds would still be recognized even if they\u2019re also bringing in other elements. I would hope in the future there might be more room in the category.\u201d",
      "For Hughes, the nominees further confuse the distinctions. Consider this example: Zach Top's album borrows heavily from George Strait's sound, which emerged in the \u201870s as a mesh of honky-tonk traditions and contemporary country. Hip-hop also emerged in the \u201970s. They were simultaneous. \u201cBut I have a feeling we won\u2019t be seeing a lot of hip-hop-inspired artists in the traditional category,\u201d he says.",
      "But that doesn't mean it might not evolve in the future. \u201cIf the Grammys fundamentally exist to give people recognition,\u201d he says, \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnytime the pipe widens, more water gets through. And this was the pipe widening, baby,\u201d Jelly Roll, who is nominated in the inaugural best contemporary country album category, told The Associated Press. \u201cI love it. I'm happy. I\u2019m a fan of both sides. It encourages me to maybe make a traditional country album one day, you know? So, this is cool.\u201d",
      "Three-time Grammy award winner Brad Paisley has a similar stance: There's a benefit to having more country music recognitions.",
      "\u201cAwards are really tools to sort of get awareness for something that you made, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re never the goal. It\u2019s always more like, \u2018Oh, cool, this might make more people listen to it.\u2019 \u2026 If this means they got to make more little gold gramophone statues to give out, and two people get them versus one, great.\u201d",
      "That said: Paisley's not sure which category he would fall into, or if the division could color an artist's creative decisions. \u201cI\u2019d almost have to think it through like, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re going for the Grammy on this. I better not do this on this record or something.\u2019 But hopefully that doesn\u2019t ever enter into it,\u201d he says.",
      "Hopefully, it's just a panel decided who belongs in which category, \u201cand then two people get to go home happy versus one. And that\u2019s good in my book,\u201d he said.",

      "Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be resentful you\u2019re not part of any of them, not even the one where Tom Waits plays Adam Driver\u2019s dad. To be fair, all the groupings are pretty cool on paper. In the first chapter, siblings Jeff (Driver) and Emily (Mayim Bialik) drive together to visit their father (Waits) for the first time in a while. In the second, a mother (Charlotte Rampling) awaits her grown daughters Tim ( Cate Blanchett ) and Lilith ( Vicky Krieps ) for their annual tea. And in the third, all that\u2019s left of Skye (Indya Moore) and Billy\u2019s (Luka Sabbat) parents are things.",
      "But these are awkward and strained hangouts, none connected to one another literally, and all in different parts of the world. Yet there are little threads throughout \u2014 Rolex watches, toasting with water, red clothing, and the idiom \u201cbob\u2019s your uncle,\u201d for instance. And then there\u2019s the more cosmically haunting realization that familiarity and closeness are not always in the cards when it comes to family. In \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother,\u201d everyone would rather be anywhere but where they are. Same same, but different, you know?",
      "The film opens with \u201cFather,\u201d and siblings Jeff and Emily reluctantly doing a kind of wellness check on theirs. They\u2019re both very buttoned up and formal, both in appearance (blazers, sweaters, combed hair) and demeanor. Waits, as their father, is very much the opposite \u2014 one might imagine that he doesn\u2019t even own a blazer, or a comb for that matter. His home is as rumpled as his zip up hoodie sweatshirt and he is a little bumbling himself, rattling off all the drugs he\u2019s not taking (anymore). The chasm between him and his children is vast and growing. Besides the death of their mother, it doesn\u2019t even seem like there was even some inciting incident that might explain some level of estrangement \u2014 they\u2019re just very, very different. And the father might not be as helpless and destitute as he\u2019s presenting to his children. After they leave, he tidies the place up and calls a friend to go out to a nice dinner.",
      "Blame it on the age of the people who get to make the movies, but the parents are often the afterthoughts, the supporting characters in the children\u2019s stories. Jarmusch slyly inverts this in the \u201cFather\u201d segment, which perfectly tees up expectations for his next entry, \u201cMother,\u201d in which Rampling is on the phone, presumably with a therapist, mentally preparing for her daughters to arrive. They all live around Dublin, but rarely see one another, making this tea a bit of a dreaded ritual. Blanchett\u2019s Tim, a quintessential first born, is very stressed about being late. Krieps\u2019 Lilith, meanwhile, is all about posturing \u2014 bragging about material things and accomplishments that she doesn\u2019t have the receipts for and knows on some level no one believes anyway. These women aren't connecting either.",
      "In the final segment, the parents are gone. They\u2019ve died and left behind only mementos in a Parisian apartment that\u2019s three months overdue on rent. This is both a puzzle and a mess that their children now have to clean up and make sense of. \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d is in some ways deeply cynical about family bonds and the possibility of ever really knowing ones' parents.

      "Leaves and bodies fall in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d Park Chan-wook\u2019s masterfully devilish satire with a chilling autumnal wind blowing through it.",
      "\u201cCome on, fall,\u201d urges You Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) as he grills an eel for dinner for his family in the opening moments of Park's film. He's eager for the season to start but unprepared for the amount of cyclical collapse \u2014 familial, economic, even existential \u2014 that Park has in store.",
      "Man-su pronounces the very thing no movie protagonist ever should: \u201cI've got it all.\u201d He lives with his wife, Miri (Son Ye-jin), and two children (Kim Woo Seung, Choi So Yul) in a handsome modernist house in the woods, with two golden retrievers. But almost as soon as he says that, Man-su's fortunes turn. After 25 years at a paper mill, Man-su is laid off, as are many others, with little fanfare or apology. Desperation begins to set in. He's forced to sell the home he loves so dearly, including the attached greenhouse where he tends to plants and bonsai trees. They even have to, horror of horrors, cancel Netflix.",
      "Another movie might have sunk with Man-su into bankruptcy and midlife struggle, following his quest to find a new line of work and restart his life. This is not that movie. Man-su, considering his prospects, decides he needs to better his odds of new employment. After posting a fake job listing and comparing all the incoming resumes, he decides he's about the fifth best option for any new paper mill managerial jobs. He decides to kill the ones with better credentials.",
      "The concept, a Grade-A barnburner of a movie idea, is not new. \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d South Korea's Oscar submission, is based on Donald Westlake\u2019s 1997 crime novel \u201cThe Ax,\u201d which Costa-Gavras also made into a film in 2005. But Park, the filmmaker of such diabolical movies as \u201cOldboy,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d and \u201cDecision to Leave,\u201d is exquisitely suited to the material. This is a director capable of conjuring menacing brutality with nothing but a hallway and hammer.",
      "And in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d he remains at the peak of his powers, archly and elegantly spinning a yarn about a murderous rampage that accumulates wider and wider reverberations. \u201cHitchcockian\u201d is a term that often, understandably, finds Park. He is, like Hitch, a seemingly polite and erudite man with a latently dark imagination. But for more than two decades, Park has cut his own bloody, unyieldingly meticulous path in movies that are rarely predictable, very funny and sneakily revelatory.",

      "Much of the delight of \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d which Park co-wrote with Lee Kyoung-mi, Don McKellar and Jahye Lee, isn't just seeing how Man-su's scheme goes but how Park frames it. He is probably the preeminent filmmaker of putting wild, outrageous happenings into cleverly formal, eminently stylish imagery. As Man-su bumbles from target to target, each potential murder is a window into another family reckoning with unemployment. The way Man-su spies on them (or worse) adds delicious layers of satire. Relish, especially, the way Park uses reflections and trees.",
      "How \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d puts capitalism in the crosshairs, with a handsome house in the center, will no doubt bring to mind another Korean satire: Bong Joon Ho's \u201cParasite.\u201d Park had been wanting to make his film for almost two decades. Either way, the two movies would make one hell of a destabilizing double feature.",
      "If \u201cParasite\u201d was the feat of an ensemble, \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d belongs to Lee. His Man-su is no killer at heart, and his attempts to become one are as comical as they are Dostoyevskian. The tone is so farcical that the gruesomeness of some of Man-su's acts come slyly. How many movies have we seen about a parent driven, heroically, to extremes to defend their family? Man-su's circumstance is frightfully understandable. \u201cOur family is in a war,\u201d he says. To keep them happy \u2014 in particular Miri \u2014 Man-su thinks whatever it takes is necessary.",
      "But what makes \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d brilliant is how it shows that perceived predicament as a ubiquitous mistake of modern life. I won't spoil the incredible final minutes of Park's film, but they expand the notion of necessary termination \u2014 of a job, of a life \u2014 to automation, AI and beyond. The leaves falling in \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d aren't coming back in the spring.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet squints as he gazes out at the Manhattan shoreline. It\u2019s a few hours before the premiere of his new movie, \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d but at this moment, he\u2019s sitting on a quiet bench at the end of a West Side pier.",
      "It\u2019s brisk and there\u2019s snow on the ground, but it\u2019s sunny and Chalamet, dressed warmly in a parka, is enjoying the perspective looking back at the city. For him, it\u2019s like looking back on himself.",
      "\u201cNow in my late 20s, there should be every reason to go, \u2018All right, career\u2019s good. Let me start shilling out,\u2019\u201d says Chalamet, who turns 30 just after Christmas. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I\u2019ve quadrupled down on the original pursuit of my life. I\u2019ve gotten out of the pool and redived from a higher board.\u201d",
      "That high dive is \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d Josh Safdie\u2019s hyperkinetic 1950s-set New York tale of a singular striver. Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a Jewish kid working at a shoe store who aspires to be the best table tennis pro in the world. The character is loosely based on a real-life player, Marty Reisman, but the movie is just as much a reflection of Chalamet and Safdie\u2019s own whatever-it-takes ambitions.",
      "\u201cThe gift of my life is this work,\u201d Chalamet says while seagulls fly overhead. \u201cYou want to honor it. Not in some Keynesian way \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right economist to cite. Capitalistic is not what I mean. I mean: If you\u2019re not going up, you\u2019re kind of going down. \u2018He not busy being born is busy dying,\u2019 the great Dylan quote. Ooh, is that on the money.\u201d",
      "Since his breakthrough performance in 2017\u2019s \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d Chalamet has been on an ever-ascending path that seemed to reach a culmination when he, soon after finishing shooting on \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d declared that he\u2019s \u201cin pursuit of greatness\u201d while accepting the best actor award from the Screen Actors Guild for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "But \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is yet another new level for Chalamet. His Marty, far from a period-piece study, is a blur of forward motion. (To shoot the film\u2019s sprinting poster, Safdie closed down two blocks, so Chalamet would be up to full speed.) To make his dreams a reality, Marty uses every desperate scheme and every bit of grandiose swagger. He's a quintessentially American hustler, and it\u2019s probably the defining performance of Chalamet\u2019s young career. A year after he came so close, it may win him his first Academy Award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like a long arc thing for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m chasing a feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d which opens wide Thursday, is a big test. A24 spent some $70 million on it, making it one of the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted movies ever. To build the hype, Chalamet has unveiled some very Marty-esque stunts, including an 18-minute video of a pseudo-Zoom call about the movie\u2019s marketing. That led to a real orange blimp, emblazoned with \u201cDream Big,\u201d flying over Los Angeles.",
      "When The Associated Press caught up with Safdie at his Chelsea office, he had recently returned from promoting the movie in London, Brazil and Los Angeles. For him, \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d could hardly be more personal. Pingpong paddles filled his office, as did an old piece of awning scrounged from Rodney Dangerfield\u2019s New York comedy club. Safdie once tried to turn pro at table tennis, himself, before moviemaking became his obsession.",
      "\u201cMy dad is the ultimate dreamer,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cHe still dreams to this day. When I was a kid, I\u2019d ask him where I came from. And he\u2019d say, \u2018You came from the stars.\u2019 It put this intense feeling inside me that there was huge future ahead of me.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother, Benny, set out to make films, they had a New York hustler mentality. For their second feature, \u201cDaddy Longlegs,\u201d they approached the filmmaker Ronald Bronstein, then working as a projectionist, and told him he had to star in the film. Bronstein wasn't even an actor.",
      "\u201cI thought: This guy is made out helium and I\u2019ve had my feet stuck in lead for six years,\u201d recalls Bronstein, who co-wrote \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "The hardscrabble life of independent filmmaking made Safdie accustomed to giving everything to get his movies made. To convince a potential financier to pay for the basketball portions of 2019's \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d Safdie, a non-drinker, remembers downing half a dozen whiskies during a meeting.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re at their beck and call,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother finished \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d years of pouring everything into Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler\u2019s character in the film) left him feeling purposeless. \u201cYou start to ask yourself: What is the purpose of a dream?\u201d",

      "Safdie sent Chalamet a video of table tennis players from 1948 set to Peter Gabriel\u2019s \u201cI Have the Touch.\u201d The suggestion was: This is a period movie told with contemporary topspin. For years, while working on other movie sets, Chalamet built up his table tennis skills.",
      "\u201cJosh wanted me to tap into a period of my life when my audacity was all I had,\u201d Chalamet says. Immediately, he saw himself in Marty. \u201cI was singularly driven starting at 14.\u201d",
      "Safdie and Chalamet are now launching something almost anathema in theaters this holiday season: a wholly original, big-budget, R-rated movie fronted by star power. Signs suggest audiences aren\u2019t just ready, they\u2019re hungry for it. The limited opening of \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d in six cinemas, set per-screen records. There were 92 sellouts.",
      "\u201cI said this when I went to (former high school) LaGuardia last year: Don\u2019t act for other actors. Act for real audiences,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cWhile we were shooting \u2018Dune 3\u2019 over the summer, Denis (Villeneuve) said at some point he realized it was more about pleasing real people. You look at the business structure of the film industry, how it\u2019s been contracting since the \u201980s, it\u2019s ludicrous to be focused on anything but real audiences.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see more original movies made,\u201d adds Chalamet. \u201cThey\u2019re the most exciting ones to see. Every original film I\u2019ve seen this year, I like it before I even start it. That\u2019s a whole new mentality I\u2019ve had, just feeling like we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is also a part of the proud lineage of New York movies, and self-consciously crafted in an American movie tradition. It may feel like a millennial watershed, but its production design is by a legend of an earlier era, Jack Fisk. The 74-year-old Bronx filmmaker Abel Ferrara appears in it. They're veterans of a grittier, more handcrafted time stretching back to the 1970s that's been particularly influential to Safdie. Robert Altman\u2019s 1902-set 1971 film \u201cMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,\u201d he notes, is the exact same time difference between when it takes place and when it was shot as \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe tradition, particularly of New York filmmaking, movies like \u2018French Connection,\u2019 I try to let them seep into me,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m casting Abel Ferrara. I\u2019m trying to at least cultivate those influences.\u201d",
      "That \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is a deeply New York film, and maybe a new classic one, is also a special point of pride for Chalamet, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen. Leaning forward as the afternoon winter light brightens the waterfront, Chalamet remembers he used to play soccer as a kid on this pier.",
      "\u201cJust to be here, back where I\u2019m from. What a dream,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cI also feel like my artistry has grown, not as a talking point or as hyperbole, but as a humble fact of foundation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the kind of thing Marty might say. Indeed, some of Chalamet\u2019s recent declarations have struck some like he\u2019s still in character. Asked whether he\u2019s sincere or engaging in a little Method marketing, Chalamet takes a long pause and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d",

Suddenly we\u2019re seeing footage of sperm traveling \u2014 talk about strivers! \u2014 up to an egg. Which morphs, of course, into a pingpong ball.",

That film, which feels much like the precursor to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d began as a trip through the shiny innards of a rare opal, only to wind up inside Adam Sandler\u2019s colon, mid-colonoscopy.",

He\u2019s a great salesman: \u201cI could sell shoes to an amputee,\u201d he boasts, crassly. But what he\u2019s plotting to unveil to the world has nothing to do with shoes.

      "Shaking off that sorta-armed robbery thing, Marty arrives in London, where he fast-talks his way into a suite at the Ritz. Here, he spies fellow guest Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow, in a wise, stylish return to the screen), a former movie star married to an insufferable tycoon (\u201cShark Tank\u201d personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, one of many nonactors here.)",
      "Kay\u2019s skeptical, but Marty finds a way to woo her. Really, all he has to say is: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d Once she sees him play, she\u2019s sneaking into his room in a lace corselet.",

      "According to research from the 506 Sports Archive, the Christmas night game between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs on Prime Video will be his 779th NFL broadcast.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s been a fantastic ride. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable because it came out of nowhere back in 1986,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking 40 years, you don\u2019t think in those terms when you\u2019re 40 years old, but here we are. It\u2019s hard to believe, but I am blessed and thankful.\u201d",
      "Except for two years in 1974 and \u201875, when Michaels did afternoon games for NBC and CBS, Michaels\u2019 broadcasts have been mostly in prime time. He has also called 11 Super Bowls, tying him with Pat Summerall.",
      "Michaels was the play-by-play voice for ABC\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d from 1986 until 2005. He was then traded to NBC when it launched \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d in 2006, and he called that package until 2021. This is his fourth season doing Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d",
      "Michaels is the dean of NFL announcers in terms of games called. CBS\u2019 Kevin Harlan is the closest among active announcers, with 542, and would need at least 13 seasons to catch Michaels whenever he decides to retire.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all done so many big games at this point, but he truly gets excited when he has the opportunity to do a big game. And you can\u2019t say that for a lot of people in our business,\u201d said Fred Gaudelli, who was Michaels\u2019 producer for 23 seasons. \u201cAfter a certain amount of time, you lose that fire in your belly to really do it, and he\u2019s never lost that.\"",
      "Kirk Herbstreit, who is in his fourth season as Michaels\u2019 partner, said he has grown to appreciate Michaels\u2019 ability to manage a broadcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always noticed that the bigger the moment, when you really feel urgency as a broadcaster, Al gets calmer and just waits for the right time to bring his voice to that crescendo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been blown away by how he does his job, how organized and prepared he is, and how much he loves it. That\u2019s what really comes across to me. He is completely dialed in, loves the sport, and loves telling stories.\u201d",
      "Michaels has worked with eight analysts. Cris Collinsworth worked with him the longest, at 13 seasons, while his seven years with John Madden rank among the best booth pairings.",
      "ABC Sports executive Dennis Swanson decided to bring Michaels aboard and move Frank Gifford to the analyst spot on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d after firing O.J. Simpson and Joe Namath.",

      "In 1987, \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d returned to a three-man booth when Dan Dierdorf joined from CBS. He, Michaels and Gifford worked together for 11 seasons, including three Super Bowls.",
      "\u201cFrank and I got along great, but I think the feeling was from Swanson and the people at ABC is that Frank had been out of the game so long that they needed to or felt they needed to bring somebody more contemporary in,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cDan was an easy fit for us. I mean, a three-man booth is never easy, and it is rough around the analysts because they have to decide who\u2019s coming in at what point, but it was a natural flow.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt was so different than anything else I\u2019ve done in my entire 50-year career,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cIt was not easy because my biggest problem was Dennis had a lot of really good lines, but if I laughed too much, I would sound like a hyena.

So that was Dennis at his best. You\u2019re just capturing a moment, saying something pithy like that. It is funny,\u201d Michaels said.",

      "Their first broadcast together was the 2002 Hall of Fame game. By the second commercial break, Michaels felt their partnership was already natural.",
      "Michaels\u2019 hardest season was 2005, the last on ABC before \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d moved to ESPN. Madden went to NBC, as did producer Gaudelli and director Drew Esocoff. After Super Bowl 40, Michaels was traded to NBC in exchange for the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Walt Disney\u2019s precursor to Mickey Mouse that had ended up in NBC's control.",
      "The \u201cPrime Video\u201d broadcasts have subtly celebrated Michaels\u2019 long career with a segment called \u201cThe Al-Manac,\u201d where a key moment from a great game that Michaels has called is shown, and he gives his memories of the play or the game.",
      "Mark Teitelman, the lead game producer for \u201cThursday Night Football,\u201d said Michaels\u2019 history of calling big games and storytelling ability made it a natural addition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good chance if it\u2019s a game you remember, Al called that game,\u201d Teitelman said.",
      "Michaels\u2019 favorite game remains Super Bowl 43 in 2009 when the Pittsburgh Steelers rallied to beat the Arizona Cardinals. Besides Santonio Holmes\u2019 6-yard TD catch with 35 seconds remaining, the game also included James Harrison\u2019s 100-yard interception return on the last play of the first half.",
      "It was also Madden\u2019s last game as an analyst. He announced his retirement three months later.",
      "Michaels has felt a jolt of energy working with Herbstreit, who is the busiest man in football between his college and NFL duties.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how he does it. He\u2019s got gigantic energy, and he\u2019s tremendously well prepared,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cWe have a lot of fun. I think we have a great back-and-forth, give-and-take. It\u2019s natural. It took a little while to become natural, but it does with anybody. And once we got going, great.\u201d",
      "Prime Video is averaging 14.96 million viewers, making it the most-watched season since a regular Thursday night package started in 2006. That is a 13% increase over last year\u2019s average and a huge leap from 9.58 million average during Prime Video\u2019s first year in 2022.",

      "Sixteen years into the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, Pandora is still abundant in box-office riches. \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d the third film in Cameron\u2019s science-fiction franchise, launched with $88 million domestically and $257 million internationally. The only film to open bigger in 2025 was \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($497.2 million over three days). In the coming weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will have the significant benefit of the highly lucrative holiday moviegoing corridor.",
      "But there was a tad less fanfare to this \u201cAvatar\u201d film, coming three years after \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water.\u201d That film launched in 2022 with a massive $435 million globally and $134 million in North America. Domestically, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d fell a hefty 35% from the previous installment. Reviews for \u201cFire and Ash\u201d were also more mixed, scoring a series-low 68% \u201cfresh\u201d score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "Yet those quibbles are only a product of the lofty standards of \u201cAvatar.\u201d The first two films rank as two of the three biggest box-office films of all time. To reach those heights, the \u201cAvatar\u201d films have depended on legs more than huge openings.",
      "\u201cAvatar\u201d (2009), opened with $77 million domestically but held the top spot for seven weeks. It ultimately grossed $2.92 billion worldwide. \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d also held strong to eventually tally $2.3 billion globally.",
      "\u201cThe openings are not what the \u2018Avatar\u2019 movies are about,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do after they open that made them the no. 2 and no. 3 biggest films of all time.\u201d",
      "For \u201cFire and Ash\u201d to follow in those footsteps, it will need robust ticket sales to continue for weeks. Working in its favor so far: strong word-of-mouth. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "In interviews, Cameron has repeatedly said \u201cFire and Ash\u201d needs to perform well for there to be subsequent \u201cAvatar\u201d films. (Four and five are already written but not greenlit.) These are exceptionally expensive movies to make. With a production budget of at least $400 million, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is one of the costliest movies ever made.",
      "\u201cJames Cameron is not known for his low budget movies,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly create the world of Pandora on the cheap. If you\u2019re going to have a 3D movie, an epic film that\u2019s three hours and 17 minutes, it\u2019s a huge buy-in of money, time, resources, and then you have to hope the audience wants to once again go along on that ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d was especially boosted by premium format showings, which accounted for 66% of its opening weekend. A narrow majority of moviegoers (56%) chose to watch it in 3D.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have always been especially popular overseas. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d was strongest in China, where its $57.6 million opening weekend surpassed the two previous movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d didn\u2019t have the weekend entirely to itself.

      "The decision was taken during a general assembly of museum workers, who voted unanimously to pause the strike to allow the museum to welcome visitors, unions said in a statement. The walkout had led to a full closure earlier in the week and a partial reopening on Wednesday.",
      "Unions said the suspension followed five meetings with Culture Ministry officials but said progress remains insufficient, particularly on staffing levels, pay and long-term security plans. They also cited concerns over building deterioration and working conditions.",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a Brazilian feature shortlisted for the Oscars, is all about ordinary people. It follows an unassuming scientist and widowed father who becomes a target of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s \u2014 not because he is an activist or revolutionary, but because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in danger simply for being who he is, for holding the values he holds,\u201d star Wagner Moura told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how authoritarianism works everywhere.\u201d",
      "Directed by Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d has been hailed by critics as one of the year\u2019s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendon\u00e7a Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).",
      "Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama.",
      "\u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d which won this year\u2019s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.",
      "In Brazil, expectations for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film \u2014 and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists \u2014 has made him \u201cincredibly happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo country develops without culture, without identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.\u201d",
      "Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d opens with a black-and-white montage of the era\u2019s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all consumed incredible things from so many places \u2014 from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cI am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it\u2019s good, it will be universal.\u201d",
      "Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother\u2019s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry \u2014 a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.",
      "One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director\u2019s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cThe Omen,\u201d shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.",
      "Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as \u201cMarighella,\u201d directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.",
      "Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil\u2019s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.",

      "\u201cHer authenticity carries something of many women I\u2019ve known,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cThere\u2019s something literary about her.\u201d",

      "Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young ...",
      "NEW YORK -- A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone\u2019s gender expression doesn\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS\u2019s declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",

      "The supplies, which came from the state and were paid for with federal money, were for a program where drug users exchange dirty needles for clean ones, part of a strategy known as harm reduction. But under a July executive order from President Donald Trump, federal substance abuse grants can\u2019t pay for supplies such as cookers and tourniquets that it says \u201conly facilitate illegal drug use.\u201d Needles already couldn\u2019t be purchased with federal money.",
      "In some places, the order is galvanizing support for syringe exchange programs, which decades of research show are extremely effective at preventing disease among intravenous drug users and getting them into treatment.",
      "In others, it\u2019s fueling opposition that threatens the programs' existence.",
      "Republican-led Indiana passed a law allowing exchanges a decade ago after the tiny city of Austin became the epicenter of the worst drug-fueled HIV outbreak in U.S. history. Unless lawmakers extend it, that law is scheduled to sunset next year, and the number of exchanges has been dwindling. State officials told remaining programs to comply with Trump's order \u2014 and even to discard federally funded supplies such as cookers and tourniquets.",

      "Some public health experts lament that syringe services programs have become subject to growing politicization and dissent.",
      "Clark County Health Officer Dr. Eric Yazel says IV drug users will likely inject themselves with or without clean supplies. Exchanges prevent people from sharing needles and spreading disease, he said, \u201cdecreasing the public health risk for the whole population.\u201d",

      "When participants arrive at the Clark County health department, they look down at a list of services and say they are there for \u201cNo. 1.\u201d",
      "They choose from a cart with needles, bandages, sharps containers and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. They can receive testing for HIV and hepatitis C; information on drug treatment; and flyers on food banks, housing, and job placement. There are even handmade knit hats with encouraging notes like, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe spend a half hour, 45 minutes or so talking to them about where they are, if they want treatment, if they\u2019re ready,\u201d Program Director Dorothy Waterhouse said. \u201cThese are our brothers, our sisters, our mothers, our fathers. \u2026 We need compassion to make sure they\u2019re getting into treatment.\u201d",

      "He's sober today. He sought drug treatment at LifeSpring Health Systems after encouragement from health workers and now encourages others in recovery to stay healthy.",

      "A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died",
      "WASHINGTON -- Medicaid programs made more than $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died, according to a new report from the independent watchdog for the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "But the department's Office of Inspector General said it expects a new provision in Republicans\u2019 One Big Beautiful Bill requiring states to audit their Medicaid beneficiary lists may help reduce these improper payments in the future.",
      "These kinds of improper payments are \u201cnot unique to one state, and the issue continues to be persistent,\u201d Aner Sanchez, deputy regional inspector general in the Office of Audit Services told The Associated Press. Sanchez has been researching this issue for a decade.",
      "The watchdog report released Tuesday said more than $207.5 million in managed care payments were made on behalf of deceased enrollees between July 2021 to July 2022. The office recommends that the federal government share more information with state governments to recover the incorrect payments \u2014 including a Social Security database known as the Full Death Master File, which contains more than 142 million records going back to 1899.",
      "Sharing the Full Death Master File data has been tightly restricted due to privacy laws which protect against identity theft and fraud.",
      "The massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer expands how the Full Death Master File can be used by mandating Medicaid agencies to quarterly audit their provider and beneficiary lists against the file, beginning in 2027.

Since 2016, HHS' inspector general has conducted 18 audits on a selection of state programs and had identified that Medicaid agencies had improperly made managed care payments on behalf of deceased enrollees totaling approximately $289 million.",
      "The government had some success using the Full Death Master File to prevent improper payments earlier this year. In January, the Treasury Department reported that it had clawed back more than $31 million in federal payments that improperly went to dead people as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave Treasury temporary access to the file for three years as part of the 2021 appropriations bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the SSA has been making unusual updates to the file itself, adding and removing records, and complicating its use. For instance, the Trump administration in April moved to classify thousands of living immigrants as dead and cancel their Social Security numbers to crack down on immigrants who had been temporarily allowed to live in the U.S. under programs started during the Biden administration.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Thursday displayed apparent progress in the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine, with state media photos showing a largely completed hull, as leader Kim Jong Un condemned rival South Korea\u2019s push to acquire the technology.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim visited a shipyard to inspect the construction of what the North describes as an 8,700-ton-class nuclear-propelled submarine, which the leader has previously called a crucial step in the modernization and nuclear armament of North Korea\u2019s navy. The North has indicated it plans to arm the submarine with nuclear weapons, calling it a \u201cstrategic guided missile submarine\u201d or a \u201cstrategic nuclear attack submarine.\u201d",
      "During the visit, Kim described South Korea\u2019s efforts to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine, which have been backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, as an \u201coffensive act\u201d that severely violates the North\u2019s security and maritime sovereignty.",

      "The agency did not specify when Kim visited the shipyard but released photos showing him inspecting a huge, burgundy-colored vessel, coated with what appears to be anti-corrosion paint, under construction inside an assembly hall with senior officials and his daughter. It was the first time North Korean state media had released images of the submarine since March, when they mostly showed the lower sections of the vessel.",
      "It was not immediately clear how close North Korea is to completing the vessel. But because submarines are typically built from the inside out, the release of what appears to be a largely completed hull suggests that many core components, including the engine and possibly the reactor, are already in place, said Moon Keun-sik, a submarine expert at Seoul\u2019s Hanyang University.",
      "\u201cShowing the entire vessel now seems to indicate that most of the equipment has already been installed and it is just about ready to be launched into the water,\u201d said Moon, a former submarine officer in the South Korean navy, who believes the North Korean submarine could possibly be tested at sea within months.",
      "A nuclear-powered submarine was one item on a long wish list of sophisticated weaponry that Kim announced during a major political conference in 2021 to cope with what he called growing U.S.-led military threats. Other weapons were solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons, spy satellites and multi-warhead missiles. North Korea has since performed a run of testing activities to acquire them.",
      "It would be a worrying developing if North Korea obtains a greater ability to fire missiles from underwater is a worrying development, because it\u2019s difficult to detect such launches in advance. But there have been questions about whether North Korea, a heavily sanctioned and impoverished country, could get resources and technology to build nuclear-powered submarines.",

    "story": [
      "Dickson Ngome's farm at Lake Naivasha in Kenya's Rift Valley has been submerged due to rising water levels",
      "NAIVASHA, Kenya -- When Dickson Ngome first leased his farm at Lake Naivasha in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley in 2008, it was over 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from shore. The farm was on 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of fertile land where he grew vegetables to sell at local markets.",
      "At the time, the lake was receding and people were worried that it might dry up altogether. But since 2011, the shore has crept ever closer. The rains started early this year, in September, and didn't let up for months.",
      "One morning in late October, Ngome and his family woke up to find their home and farm inside the lake. The lake levels had risen overnight and about a foot of water covered everything.",
      "\u201cIt seemed as if the lake was far from our homes,\u201d Ngome\u2019s wife, Rose Wafula, told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then one night we were shocked to find our houses flooded. The water came from nowhere.\u201d",
      "The couple and their four children have had to leave home and are camping out on the first floor of an abandoned school nearby.",
      "Some 5,000 people were displaced by the rise in Lake Naivasha\u2019s levels this year. Some scientists attribute the higher levels to increased rains caused by climate change, although there may be other factors causing the lake\u2019s steady rise over the past decade.",
      "The lake is a tourism hot spot and surrounded by farms, mostly growing flowers, which have gradually been disappearing into the water as the lake levels rise.",
      "Rising levels have not been isolated to Naivasha: Kenya\u2019s Lake Baringo, Lake Nakuru and Lake Turkana \u2014 all in the Rift Valley \u2014 have been steadily rising for 15 years.",
      "\u201cThe lakes have risen almost beyond the highest level they have ever reached,\u201d said Simon Onywere, who teaches environmental planning at Kenyatta University in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi.",
      "A study in the Journal of Hydrology last year found that lake areas in East Africa increased by 71,822 square kilometers (27,730 square miles) between 2011 and 2023. That affects a lot of people: By 2021, more than 75,000 households had been displaced across the Rift Valley, according to a study commissioned that year by the Kenyan Environment Ministry and the United Nations Development Program.",
      "In Baringo, the submerged buildings that made headlines in 2020 and 2021 are still underwater.",
      "\u201cIn Lake Baringo, the water rose almost 14 meters,\u201d Onywere said. \u201cEverything went under, completely under. Buildings will never be seen again, like the Block Hotels of Lake Baringo.\u201d",
      "Lake Naivasha has risen steadily too, \u201cengulfing three quarters of some flower farms,\u201d Onywere said.",
      "Horticulture is a major economic sector in Kenya, generating just over a billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2024 and providing 40% of the volume of roses sold in the European Union, according to Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Significant research has gone into the reasons behind the rising lakes phenomenon: A 2021 study on the rise of Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley lakes was coauthored by Kenyan meteorologist Richard Muita, who is now acting assistant director of the Kenya Meteorological Department.",
      "\u201cThere are researchers who come up with drivers that are geological, others with reasons like planetary factors,\u201d Muita said. \u201cThe Kenya Meteorological Department found that the water level rises are associated with rainfall patterns and temperature changes. When the rains are plentiful, it aligns with the increase in the levels of the Rift Valley lake waters.\u201d",

      "Naivasha\u2019s official high water mark was demarcated at 1,892.8 meters (6,210 feet) above sea level by the Riparian Association in 1906, and is still used by surveyors today. That means this year\u2019s flooding was still almost a meter (3 feet) below the high mark.",
      "It also means that the community of Kihoto on Lake Naivasha where the Ngomes lived lies on riparian land \u2014 land that falls below the high water mark, and can only be owned by the government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mess established by the government \u2026 towards the late 1960s,\u201d said Silas Wanjala, general manager of the Lake Naivasha Riparian Association, which was founded some 120 years ago and has been keeping meticulous records of the lake\u2019s water levels since.",
      "Back then, a farmer was given a \u201ctemporary agricultural lease\u201d on Kihoto, said Wanjala. When it later flooded and the farmer packed up and left, the farmworkers stayed on the land and later applied for subdivisions, which were approved. In the 60-odd years since, a whole settlement has grown on land that is officially not for lease or sale.",
      "This also isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s been flooded, said Wanjala. It's just very rare that the water comes up this high. That\u2019s little consolation for the people who have been displaced by this year\u2019s floods and now cannot go home without risking confrontations with hippopotamuses.",
      "To support those people, the county is focusing its efforts on where the need is greatest.",
      "\u201cWe are tackling this as an emergency,\" says Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, which oversees Lake Naivasha. \u201cThe county government has provided trucks to help families relocate. We have been helping to pay rent for those who lack the finances.\u201d",
      "Scientists like Onywere and Muita are hoping for longer-term solutions. \u201cCould we have predicted this so that we could have done better infrastructure in less risk-prone areas?\u201d Onywere said.",
      "Muita wants to see a more concerted global effort to combat climate change, as well as local, nature-based solutions centered on Indigenous knowledge, such as \u201cconservation agriculture, where there is very limited disturbance of the land,\u201d to reduce sedimentation of the lakes.",
      "But all of this is of little help to Ngome and Wafula, who are still living at the school with their children. As the rest of the world looks forward to the holidays and new year, their future is uncertain. Lake Naivasha\u2019s continuous rise over the past 15 years does not bode well: They have no idea when, or if, their farm will ever be back on dry land.",

      "Officials at Colorado's Telluride Ski Resort say it will close Saturday due to a labor dispute",
      "FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- Telluride, one of the best-known ski resorts in the Western U.S., plans to close in the coming days due to a labor dispute between its owner and the ski patrol union.",
      "The Telluride Professional Ski Patrol Association voted Tuesday to strike Saturday after contract negotiations since June failed to yield an agreement on pay. With no more talks planned before the weekend, Telluride Ski Resort said it will not open that day.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that any organization, particularly one that exists to help people, would do something that will have such a devastating effect on our community,\u201d owner Chuck Horning said Wednesday in a statement.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether the closure will last longer. Resort officials were working on a plan to reopen even if the strike continues, according to the statement.",
      "The patrollers are seeking to be paid more in line with their counterparts at other resorts in the region.",
      "The union wants starting pay to rise from $21 to $28 per hour, and for wages for patrollers with more than 30 years of experience to increase from $30-$36 per hour to $39-$48.60 per hour.",
      "While resort officials sought to lay blame for the impending closure on the union, Andy Dennis, interim safety director and spokesperson for patrollers\u2019 association, said it lies with Horning.",

      "Ski patrollers sometimes argue for more pay on the grounds that the cost of living is high in ski towns and they are responsible for people's safety. Patrollers' duties include attending to injured skiers and the controlled release of avalanches with explosives when nobody is in range.",
      "Even without a strike, Telluride has yet to get going fully this season, with unusually warm weather meaning just 20 of the resort's 149 trails have been able to open.",
      "Patrollers around the Rocky Mountain region have been voting on unionizing recently.",
      "Last year an almost two-week strike closed many runs and caused long lift lines at Utah's Park City Mountain Resort. That strike ended when Colorado-based Vail Resorts acceded to demands including a $2-an-hour base pay increase and raises for senior ski patrollers.",

      "A federal judge's ruling allows Hawaii's new tourist tax, which includes a levy on cruise ship passengers, to take effect in 2026",
      "HONOLULU -- A federal judge\u2019s ruling clears the way for Hawaii to include cruise ship passengers in a new tourist tax to help cope with climate change, a levy set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake on Tuesday denied a request seeking to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruises.",
      "In the nation\u2019s first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship\u2019s passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",

      "GiveDirectly got $50 gift cards out to SNAP recipients during last month\u2019s shutdown through a new approach to cash assistance",
      "Finances already looked tight for Jade Grant and her three children as she entered the year's final months.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s birthday is back-to-back,\u201d the 32-year-old certified nursing assistant said. \u201cYou have holidays coming up. You have Thanksgiving. Everything is right there. And then, boom. No (food) stamps.\u201d",
      "Grant is among the nearly 42 million lower-income Americans who get help buying groceries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. When the federal shutdown began in October, she wasn't worried about losing her benefits \u2014 she said she is used to government \u201cfoolishness.\u201d",
      "But circumstances got dicey when the budget impasse entered its second month and President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of freezing November SNAP payments. With one child who eats gluten free and another with many allergies, specialty items already drove up her grocery bill. Now Grant wondered how she'd put food on the table \u2014 especially with her youngest's 6th birthday approaching.",
      "Then Grant logged into Propel, an app used by 5 million people to manage their electronic benefits transfers, where she saw a pop-up banner inviting her to apply for a relief program. Within a minute she'd completed a survey and about two days later she got a virtual $50 gift card.",
      "The total didn't come close to her monthly SNAP allotment. But the Palm Bay, Florida, resident said it was enough to buy a customized \u201c Bluey \u201d birthday cake for her son.",
      "Nearly a quarter of a million families got that same cash injection from the nonprofit GiveDirectly as they missed SNAP deposits many need to feed their households. The collaboration with Propel proved to be the largest disaster response in the international cash assistance group's history outside of COVID-19; non-pandemic records were set with the $12 million raised, more than 246,000 beneficiaries enrolled and 5,000 individual donors reached.",
      "Recipients are still recovering from the uncertainty of last month's SNAP delays. Company surveys suggest many are dealing with the long-term consequences of borrowing money in early November when their benefits didn\u2019t arrive on time, according to Propel CEO Jimmy Chen. At a time when users felt the existing safety net had fallen through, they credit the rapid payments for buoying them \u2014 both financially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot. But at the same time, it is a lot,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBecause $50 can do a lot when you don\u2019t have anything.\u201d",
      "It's not the first partnership for the antipoverty nonprofit and for-profit software company. They have previously combined GiveDirectly's fast cash model with Propel's verified user base to get money out to natural disaster survivors \u2014 including $1,000 last year to some households impacted by Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "\u201cThis particular incident with the shutdown we saw as akin to a natural disaster,\" Chen said, \u201cin the sense that it created a really sudden and really acute form of hardship for many Americans across the country.\u201d",
      "The scope differed this time. The \u201cman-made disaster,\u201d as GiveDirectly U.S. Country Director Dustin Palmer put it, was not geographically isolated. The benefits freeze impacted more people than they usually serve. SNAP costs almost $10 billion a month, Palmer said, so they never expected to raise enough money to replace the delayed benefits altogether.",
      "But 5,000 individual donors \u2014 plus $1 million gifts from Propel and New York nonprofit Robin Hood, as well as other major foundations' support \u2014 provided a sizable pot. Palmer found that the issue resonated more than he expected.",
      "GiveDirectly reports that the median donation was $100. Palmer took that response as a sign the issue hit close for many Americans.",
      "\u201cYou and I know SNAP recipients. Maybe we\u2019ve been SNAP recipients,\" Palmer said. \"So that was not a disaster in Central Texas where I\u2019ve never been, but something in our communities.\u201d",
      "The greatest question revolved around the total sum of each cash transfer. Should they reach more people with fewer dollars or vice versa? Los Angeles wildfire survivors, for example, got $3,500 each from a similar GiveDirectly campaign. But that's because they wanted to provide enough to cover a month's worth of lodging and transit to those who lost their houses.",

Propel's software allowed them to send money as soon as the app detected that a family's benefits hadn't arrived at the usual time of the month.",
      "Recipients decided whether their prepaid debit cards arrived physically, which might allow them to take cash out of an ATM, or virtually, which could be used almost immediately. The split is usually pretty even, according to Palmer, but this time more than 90% of recipients went with the virtual option.",
      "\u201cTo me, that speaks to the speed and need for people,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cJust saying, \u2018Oh yeah, I just need food today. I don\u2019t want to wait to get it mailed.\u2019\u201d",

One week they gave far more than expected, she said, but the following week they were \u201cso overwhelmed\u201d that it almost wasn't worth visiting.",
      "She said it's \u201cscary\u201d the government \u201ccan just decide to not feed so many people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt least I have my safety net but not everybody\u2019s lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never trusted the government and that\u2019s just a new solid reason why I don\u2019t trust them.\u201d",
      "Chen, the Propel CEO, said his company's research suggests that November's freeze damaged many recipients' confidence in the government. Even with SNAP funded through the next fiscal year, Chen said, many respondents are concerned about another shutdown.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s introduced this seed of doubt for people that this really fundamental thing that they use to pay for food may not be there when they need it,\u201d Chen said.",

      "The delay disrupted the financial balancing act that Grant had going. She put off payments for her electricity bill and car insurance.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \u201cunacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they did not pose such risks.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.",
      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",
      "The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn\u2019t reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as \u201cenvironmentally friendly\u201d and compliant with emissions standards.",

    "story": [
      "In a breathless year of tariffs unleashed by the administration of President Donald Trump, perhaps no one has had to live the reality of every fluctuation of trade policy than customs brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- After a half-century immersed in the world of trade, customs broker Amy Magnus thought she\u2019d seen it all, navigating mountains of regulations and all sorts of logistical hurdles to import everything from lumber and bananas to circus animals and Egyptian mummies.",
      "Then came 2025.",
      "Tariffs were imposed in ways she\u2019d never seen. New rules left her wondering what they really meant. Federal workers, always a reliable backstop, grew more elusive.",
      "\u201c2025 has changed the trade system,\u201d says Magnus. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect before, but it was a functioning system. Now, it is a lot more chaotic and troubling.\u201d",
      "Once hidden cogs in the international trade machine, customs brokers are getting a rare spotlight as President Donald Trump reinvents America\u2019s commercial ties with the world. If this breathless year of tariffs amounts to a trade war, customs brokers are its front lines.",
      "Few Americans have been exposed as exhaustively to every fluctuation of trade policy as the customs broker. They were there in the opening days of Trump\u2019s second term, when tariffs were announced on Canada and Mexico, and two days later, when those same levies were paused. They were there through every rule on imports of steel and seafood, on cars and copper, on polysilicon and pharmaceuticals, and on and on. For every tariff, for every carve-out, for every order, brokers have been left to translate policy into reality, line by line and code by code, in a year when it seemed every passing week brought change.",
      "\u201cWe were used to decades of a certain way of processing, and from January to now, that universe has been turned kind of upside-down on us,\u201d says Al Raffa, a customs broker in Elizabeth, New Jersey, who helps shepherd containerloads of cargo into the U.S. packed to the brim with everything from rounds of brie to boxes of chocolate.",
      "Each arrival of products imported to the country requires filings with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and often, other agencies. Importers often turn to brokers to handle the regulatory legwork and, with a spate of new trade rules unleashed by the Trump administration, they\u2019ve seen their demand grow alongside their workloads.",
      "Many shipments that entered duty free now are tariffed. Other imports that had minimal levies that might cost a company a few hundred dollars have had their bills balloon to thousands. For Raffa and his crew, the ever-expanding list of tariffs means a given product could be subjected to taxes under multiple separate tariff lines.",
      "\u201cThat one line item of cheese that previously was just one tariff, now it could be two, three, in some cases five tariff numbers,\u201d says 53-year-old Raffa, who has had jobs in trade since he was a teenager and who has a button emblazoned with \u201cMake Trade Boring Again.\u201d",
      "Government regulations have always been a reality for brokers, and the very reason for their existence. When thick tomes of trade rules changed in the past, though, they typically were issued long ahead of their effective dates, with periods for comment and review, each word of policy crafted in an attempt to project clarity and definition.",
      "With Trump, word of a major change in trade rules might come in a Truth Social post or an oversized chart clutched by the president in a Rose Garden appearance.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019d be remiss not to be looking at the White House website on a daily basis, multiple times a day, just to see what executive order is going to be announced,\u201d Raffa says.",
      "Each announcement sends brokerage firms into a scramble to attempt to dissect the rules, update their systems to reflect them and alert their customers who may have shipments en route and for whom any shift in tariffs could mean a major hit to their bottom line.",
      "JD Gonzalez, a third-generation customs broker in Laredo, Texas, and president of the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, says the volume and speed of changes have been challenging enough. But the wording of White House orders has often left more unanswered questions than brokers are accustomed to.",
      "\u201cThe order is kind of vague sometimes, the guidance that\u2019s being provided is sometimes murky, and we\u2019re trying to make the determination,\u201d 62-year-old Gonzalez says.",

      "Gonzalez rattles off 10-digit tariff codes for alcohol and doors and recites the complicated web of rules that determine the duties on a chair with a frame made of steel produced in the U.S. but processed in Mexico. As brokers\u2019 work has grown tougher, he says some of their firms have begun charging customers more for their services because each item they\u2019re responsible for tracking on a bill of lading takes longer.",
      "\u201cYou double the time,\u201d he says.",
      "Brokers can\u2019t help but see the imprints of their work everywhere they go. Gonzalez looks at a T-shirt tag and thinks of what a broker did to get it into the country. Magnus sees Belgian chocolate or Chinese silk and is awed, despite all the things that could have kept something from landing on a store shelf, that it still arrived. Raffa walks through the supermarket, picks up a can of artichoke hearts, and considers every possible regulation that might apply to secure its import into the country.",
      "It has been heartening for brokers, who existed in the gray arcana of hidden bureaucracy unseen by most Americans, to now earn a bit more recognition.",
      "\u201cIt was maybe taken for granted how that wonderful piece of gourmet cheese got on the shelf, or that Gucci bag,\u201d says Raffa. \u201cUp until this year, people were clueless what I did.\u201d",
      "Magnus, who is in her 70s and based on Marco Island, Florida, spent 18 years at U.S. Customs before starting at a brokerage in 1992. She came to find comfort in the precision of rules governing every import she cleared the way for, from crude oil to diamonds.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t like to have any doubt, we don\u2019t like to leave anything up to interpretation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we ourselves are struggling, trying to interpret and understand the meaning of some of these things, it is a very unsettling place to be.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just the White House orders that have complicated her work.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting blitz under billionaire Elon Musk led to layoffs and retirements of trusted government workers that brokers turn to for guidance. A shutdown slowed operations at ports. And fear of being out of step with the administration has some federal employees cautious about decoding trade orders, making answers on interpretation of tariff rules sometimes tough to come by.",
      "Magnus was befuddled by moves that seemed at odds with everything she knew of trade policy. Canada as adversary? Switzerland subjected to 39% tariffs? It defied how she had come to see the choreography of cargo and what it says about the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an incredible ballet to be able to trade with all these countries all over the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my own mind, I always felt that as long as we were trading and we were friendly with each other, we were reducing the chance of war and killing each other.\u201d",
      "Work has been so hectic this year that Magnus hasn\u2019t managed to take a vacation. Weekends have so frequently been upended by Friday afternoon edicts announcing a tariff is going into effect or being taken away that it has become an inside joke with colleagues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Friday afternoon,\u201d she says. \u201cIs everybody watching?\u201d",
      "A couple hours after Magnus repeats this, the next White House order is posted, undoing a slew of tariffs on agricultural products and sending brokers into another scurry.",

      "Fragrances of all kinds and prices also have taken off as a popular purchase, outperforming sales of makeup and skincare in the first nine months of the year, the firm said.",
      "However, many shoppers don't want to get spritzed while wandering through a department store and don't want a salesperson's help picking out a perfume for loved ones or themselves. They may know what they want from hearing about social media trends like \u201cfragrance layering.\u201d Some enthusiasts collect scents like they might handbags and trust their own noses.",
      "Macy\u2019s requires its 10,000 beauty advisers to do weekly training. It covers new information from brands and the latest trends, such as the reemergence of matte makeup and \"juicy fruit\" fragrances. The advisers also get selling tips and tricks.",

It's more crucial than ever since many customers will be wearing earbuds or headphones and might not hear a spoken invitation to sample products.",
      "If customers stop by the counter, ask if they want help. If they say no, let them explore and don't be pushy. They often start asking questions if you let them linger a while, Dervil said.",

In Dior's J'Adore line, the favorite version is the \u201ceau de parfum,\" Dervil said. If a customer think that's too strong or too light, direct them accordingly, she advised.",
      "I also learned that going up or down the spectrum doesn't always mean a more diffused or intense version of the same scent. It may lead to a different smell altogether.",
      "For example, the \u201cparfum d\u2019eau\u201d form of J'Adore smelled like a lighter version of the \u201ceau de parfum.\u201d But the line's lightest scent, J'Adore Eau Lumiere, had a citrusy scent that was totally different.",

      "If they're switching from scent to scent, ask them to sniff their arm or the back of their hand to clear their nostrils for the next one, Dervil said.",

      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s shoppers like Quinn Kelsey who keep department store executives up at night.",
      "The 38-year-old Denver resident gets makeup ideas from TikTok videos and other social media content, not salespeople at beauty counters. She uses an AI chatbot to get product recommendations that fit her budget and to see how a certain foundation or lipstick would look on her. When she buys, it\u2019s usually from Amazon.",
      "\u201cI use Chat GPT as my personal beauty consultant,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cDepartment stores? I\u2019ll walk through one for the decor, but they\u2019ve basically lost me unless I can get the same product-research experience there that I can get scrolling through my phone at home.\u201d",

      "Social media also has provided new sources of beauty guidance. Instead of store advisers, many consumers look to videos by influencers, beauty brand founders or dermatologists for advice.

Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, renovated the beauty floors of their flagship New York stores to add more space, ultra-luxury brands and cutting-edge technology. At Nordstrom, customers can book an appointment to get robot-applied eyelash extensions for $170.",

But the pace was slower than a year ago amid worries about higher prices and other economic concerns, according to new data from Visa released Tuesday.",

      "\u201cIt's certainly not a spectacular season,\u201d Brown told The Associated Press. \"It's sort of an average holiday season given concerns about macro economic growth, inflation. There's still a lot of uncertainty among the consumer population.\"",

The latest job report, released by the Labor Department last week, also shows a souring employment picture.",

      "Fast shipping has become a staple of online shopping, promising delivery within a day or even hours",
      "It feels simple: You shop, find something you want and click to buy. It shows up today, overnight or tomorrow. We\u2019ve gotten used to that speed. But that convenience comes with a climate cost.",
      "Multiple factors shape the environmental toll of a delivery. These include the distance from a fulfillment center, whether the shipment rides in a half-empty truck, how many trips a driver makes in the same area and the type of transportation used to move the package.",
      "When customers choose faster shipping and earlier delivery dates, the system shifts from optimized routing to whatever gets the package out fastest, and that means higher emissions, said Sreedevi Rajagopalan, a research scientist at MIT\u2019s Center for Transportation and Logistics. For example, trucks may leave warehouses before they\u2019re full and drivers might loop the same neighborhood multiple times a day, she said.",
      "\u201cFor the same demand, fast shipping definitely increases emissions 10 to 12%,\u201d she said.",
      "To meet tight delivery windows, retailers may rely on air freight, which produces far more emissions than other options such as trains, making it the most carbon-intensive.",
      "\u201cGiven that companies want to be competitive in terms of speed, it comes at the cost of your efficiency,\u201d Sreedevi said. \u201cVans are half full, and you make multiple rounds, multiple trips to the same location \u2026 your fuel consumption goes up, and you\u2019re not able to consolidate.\u201d",
      "One way companies like Amazon try to minimize that is by placing their supply chain closer to customers to reduce mileage and improve speed for the customer. Their goal is to make the journey fast and effective, but reduce its emissions at the same time.",
      "\u201cBy really leveraging our supply chain efficiencies that we have at scale, we\u2019re able to both offer better speed and sustainability outcomes at the same time,\u201d said Chris Atkins, director of Worldwide Operations Sustainability at Amazon.",
      "Getting items to customers\u2019 doors from a fulfillment center \u2014 referred to as the \u201clast mile\u201d or \u201clast kilometer\u201d of shipping \u2014 is one of the hardest stages to make less polluting, Sreedevi said.",
      "Emissions rise even more when customers place multiple small orders throughout the week.",
      "\u201cIf I place an order this morning and then I place an order this evening and choose fast shipping, the company might have already processed my morning order and wouldn\u2019t wait for my evening order to consolidate,\" she said.",

      "Consumers can lower emissions if they're willing to wait even a tiny bit, and they'll save money at the same time, said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.",
      "Delaying delivery by one to two days can result in a 36% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and three to four days pushes that reduction to 56%, so opting for standard or delayed shipping instead of next-day or two-day shipping helps, according to Sreedevi.",
      "Amazon's Atkins said changes to their network are cutting emissions linked to fast delivery. The company has expanded the use of electric delivery vans and shifted more packages to rail and to delivering by foot or bicycle in dense cities.",
      "\u201cAviation is very carbon-intensive relative to ground shipping,\u201d said Atkins. \u201cOne of the other things that Amazon and other logistics companies are looking at doing is: How do we mode-shift to less carbon intensive forms of transportation?\"",
      "Amazon says providing shipping options that encourage customers to consolidate orders have also helped. Data for the first nine months of 2025 shows that when customers chose a single delivery day for all items, it reduced more than 300 million delivery stops and avoided 100,000 tons (90,718 metric tons) of carbon emissions, according to Atkins.",
      "People are more likely to delay or consolidate orders once they understand the environmental impact of fast shipping, according to Sreedevi, who co-authored a 2024 study of delivery customers in Mexico.",
      "\u201cA significant number of consumers decided to wait for longer delivery or delayed their shipping when we showed them the environmental impact information in the form of trees,\u201d said Sreedevi. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that they are educated.\u201d",
      "While fast shipping isn\u2019t likely to go away, experts say its climate impacts can be meaningfully reduced through small behavior shifts, both from shoppers and companies. Bundling orders, skipping the overnight option and choosing a single weekly delivery can all make a difference.",

      "Masashi \u201cJumbo\u201d Ozaki, whose 113 worldwide victories were the most of any player from Japan, died Wednesday in his home country after a battle with colon cancer, the Japan Golf Tour said. He was 78.",
      "Ozaki was revered in Japan, a big hitter with a sense of style who won 94 times over 29 years on the Japan Golf Tour, the last one coming at the 2002 ANA Open when he was 55.",
      "He rose to No. 5 in the world ranking in 1996 at age 49. Ozaki often got overlooked for never winning outside Japan except for the New Zealand PGA Championship. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2011.",
      "\u201cHe is an indispensable, one-of-a-kind figure in discussing men\u2019s golf, both now and in the future,\u201d the tour said in a social media post.",
      "Ozaki competed in 49 majors, his best finish coming in the 1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill when he finished three shots behind Curtis Strange. He played the Masters for the 19th and final time in 2000 when he was 53 and tied for 28th.",
      "Isao Aoki was the first Japanese player in the World Golf Hall of Fame, and Hideki Matsuyama became the first to win a major at the 2021 Masters. Both were inspired in some fashion by Ozaki, the pioneer in a nation now obsessed with golf.",
      "Ozaki won the Japan Open five times and the Japan PGA Championship six times. He led the Japan Golf Tour money list a record 12 times, including five in a row from 1994 through 1998. He won his final money title in 2002, when he was 55.",
      "When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, Ozaki said his one regret was not playing more outside of Japan.",
      "\u201cBut I dedicated my life to Japanese golf and am extremely grateful the voters thought I was worthy of this honor,\u201d he said upon his election. He received 50% of the vote on the International ballot.",
      "Ozaki was looked upon as the Arnold Palmer of golf in Japan with his powerful swing, charisma and sense of style, often wearing silk shirts and baggy pants. And his skill was not limited to just golf. He played the guitar and had three songs reach the pop charts in Japan, according to the Hall of Fame.",
      "His first love was baseball, and he spent three years pitching professionally before turning to golf. That was evident when Ryo Ishikawa, who won his first Japan Golf Tour title at age 15, spoke of Ozaki\u2019s influence. Ishikawa said he would visit Ozaki about 10 times a year to get advice.",

      "Lawyers for Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier are asking a judge to throw out sports gambling charges that have kept him off the court this season",
      "NEW YORK -- Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier \u2019s lawyers are asking a judge to throw out sports gambling charges that have kept him off the court this season, arguing that the government overreached by turning a private dispute over bettors\u2019 use of nonpublic information into a federal case.",
      "In a motion to dismiss made public on Tuesday, Rozier\u2019s lawyers argued that the government\u2019s theory of the case \u2014 that he prevented sportsbooks from making informed decisions about accepting certain bets \u2014 runs afoul of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the federal wire fraud statute.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn allege that Rozier, 31, helped gamblers cash in by tipping off a friend that he would leave a March 2023 game early because of a supposed injury. The friend, Deniro \u201cNiro\u201d Laster, who is also charged, shared or sold the information to others, who placed more than $250,000 in prop bets, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cThe government has billed this case as involving \u2018insider betting\u2019 and \u2018rigging\u2019 professional basketball games,\" Rozier\u2019s lawyers, James M. Trusty and A. Jeff Ifrah, wrote in the motion. \u201cBut the indictment alleges something less headline-worthy: that some bettors broke certain sportsbooks\u2019 terms of use against wagering based on non-public information and \u2018straw betting.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rozier was on the Charlotte Hornets at the time and the information about his early exit was not listed on the team\u2019s injury report, nor was it shared with the public or the sportsbooks that accept wagers on NBA games and player performances, prosecutors said.",
      "Rozier pleaded not guilty on Dec. 8 to wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges. He was released on $3 million bond and is due back in court for a hearing before U.S. District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall on March 3.",
      "His charges were part of a sweep of more than 30 other people in a takedown of two sprawling gambling operations: one that authorities said leaked inside information about NBA athletes and another involving rigged, Mafia-backed poker games.",
      "The charges have raised questions about the integrity of NBA games in an era of legalized betting and myriad prop bets, prompting the league to tweak its injury reporting requirements.",
      "A spokesperson for the federal prosecutors' office in Brooklyn declined to comment on Rozier\u2019s motion.",

      "In the motion, Rozier\u2019s lawyers wrote that under the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in United States v. Ciminelli, prosecutors can't make a wire fraud case out of allegations that defendants conspired to deprive a person \u2014 or, in this case, sportsbooks \u2014 of the right to information needed to make discretionary economic decisions.",
      "They also questioned whether federal prosecutors have the authority to bring such a case, since sportsbooks are regulated at the state level, not the federal level.",
      "\u201cThis is not to say that sports betting platforms are without recourse when their terms of use are violated \u2014 they can void bets, pursue civil remedies, or seek state prosecutor involvement,\u201d Trusty and Ifrah wrote in the motion, which was dated Dec. 12 but only posted to the case docket on Tuesday. \u201cBut Ciminelli puts to rest the notion that federal prosecutors are here to enforce contractual agreements between bettors and platforms.\u201d",
      "Rozier has earned about $160 million over a 10-year NBA career. He was a first-round pick for the Boston Celtics in 2015 after starring at the University of Louisville. Charlotte traded him to the Heat last year.",
      "In the game in question, Rozier played the first nine minutes and 36 seconds against the New Orleans Pelicans before leaving, citing a foot issue. He did not play again that season.",
      "Rozier\u2019s lawyers noted that the indictment does not allege that he ever placed a bet on any NBA game, nor does it allege that he knew Laster intended to sell his tip to others or that using it to place wagers would violate the sportsbooks\u2019 terms of service. And, they said, he really was injured.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s cynicism as to whether Mr. Rozier was injured is belied by a variety of witnesses and medical professionals who were aware of Rozier\u2019s injury, in many cases before the Pelicans game,\u201d Trusty and Ifrah wrote.",

      "Naoya Inoue and Junto Nakatani are ready to square off in what would be the biggest fight in Japanese boxing history",
      "The Floyd Mayweather Jr.- Manny Pacquiao bout happened probably five years too late. Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua still haven\u2019t fought.",
      "Naoya Inoue and Junto Nakatani are ready to square off now in what would be the biggest fight in Japanese boxing history. No posturing, just two top pound-for-pound boxers in their prime seemingly willing to give fans what they want.",
      "Here\u2019s the catch: They each have one more fight and need to avoid a surprise before their expected showdown.",
      "Inoue (31-0, 27 KOs) is the undisputed super bantamweight (122 lbs) champion and the headliner Saturday in Saudi Arabia. He faces Mexico\u2019s Alan David Picasso (32-0-1, 17 KOs). Nakatani (31-0, 24 KOs), moving up in weight to make his debut in the division, faces Sebastian Hernandez Reyes (20-0, 18 KOs) \u2014 also Mexican \u2014 on the same card, a showcase of Japanese fighters.",
      "\u201cThis is very important for Japanese boxing,\u201d Inoue told The Associated Press through a translator.",
      "Most important for Inoue and Nakatani, though, are victories that would clear the way for a blockbuster matchup, likely in Tokyo in May.",
      "\u201cFirstly, I have a plan to have a fight with Nakatani,\u201d Inoue said of his goals for 2026. \u201cAlso, I have the idea that I may move up to the featherweight division.\u201d",
      "The buildup to the Riyadh event, billed as the \u201cNight of the Samurai,\u201d has been as much about Inoue-Nakatani as it has about their respective opponents Saturday. At a press event last month, promoters sat Inoue and Nakatani next to each other and made sure they were the last two off the stage during the photo session. The pair didn\u2019t exchange chitchat or handshakes.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I have no contact or connection with him,\u201d the 32-year-old Inoue said. \u201cOf course, I value his boxing, that\u2019s why I\u2019m looking forward to fighting him.\u201d",
      "With the retirement of Terence Crawford plus the injury layoff of undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk, there\u2019s a good argument that Inoue is now the top pound-for-pound boxer in the world.",
      "The 5-foot-5 (1.65 meter) Japanese star, a four-division champion, uses precision combinations plus elite speed and power to dismantle opponents.",
      "The Yokohama native has already fought three times this year, most recently a unanimous decision victory over Murodjon Akhmadaliev in September.",
      "In two of his past five fights, Inoue has overcome an early knockdown \u2014 both times from a left hook \u2014 en route to stoppage victories. Luis Nery stunned a Tokyo Dome crowd in May 2024 when he sent Inoue to the canvas in the first round. One year later, Ramon Cardenas dropped Inoue in the second round in Las Vegas.",
      "Inoue's promoters made sure the Las Vegas fight was on ESPN rather than pay-per-view to expose him to a wider US audience. Bob Arum, Inoue\u2019s promoter at Top Rank, had said he wants Inoue to reach Shohei Ohtani-level fame.",
      "Inoue himself, however, isn't so sure.",
      "\u201cApart from the boxing, I\u2019m a boring person. I just focus on boxing.\u201d",

      "Following the game, Wembanyama introduced what he hopes is a new tradition he worked on with the Jackals while sidelined with the calf injury.",
      "The Spurs gave Wembanyama a microphone and brought a large bass drum onto the court. Wembanyama asked fans to stand, outstretch their arms and clap once after he pounded on the drum. The pause between each Wembanyama thump of the drum decreased until the Spurs fans were clapping wildly in celebration.",
      "\u201cThat was phenomenal,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cI heard about it on the fly. That was great. He may have a career in marketing. The way he got that stadium going, that was great.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\u201cThe existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\u201d said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which is being challenged in court.

      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",
      "The system is in active development and information about the timing of an expected deployment is too sensitive to share, according to an official familiar with the findings and other related intelligence that the AP did not see.

      "The intelligence findings say the pellets would be so small \u2014 just millimeters across \u2014 that they would evade detection by ground- and space-based systems that scan for space objects, which could make it hard to pin blame for any attack on Moscow.",
      "Clayton Swope, who specializes in space security and weaponry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based security and policy think tank, said if \u201cthe pellets are not trackable, that complicates things\u201d but \u201cpeople would figure it out.\u201d",

      "\u201cMost damage would probably be done to the solar panels because they\u2019re probably the most fragile part\u201d of satellites, Swope said. \u201cThat\u2019d be enough, though, to damage a satellite and probably bring it offline.\u201d",
      "After such an attack, pellets and debris would over time fall back toward Earth, possibly damaging other orbiting systems on their way down, analysts say.",
      "Starlink's orbits are about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above the planet. China\u2019s Tiangong space station and the International Space Station operate at lower orbits, \u201cso both would face risks,\u201d according to Swope.",
      "The space chaos that such a weapon could cause might enable Moscow to threaten its adversaries without actually having to use it, Swope said.",

      "The fallout from the spread of the manipulated photos and videos can create a nightmare for the victims.",
      "The challenge for schools was highlighted this fall when AI-generated nude images swept through a Louisiana middle school. Two boys ultimately were charged, but not before one of the victims was expelled for starting a fight with a boy she accused of creating the images of her and her friends.",
      "\u201cWhile the ability to alter images has been available for decades, the rise of A.I. has made it easier for anyone to alter or create such images with little to no training or experience,\u201d Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre said in a news release. \u201cThis incident highlights a serious concern that all parents should address with their children.\u201d",
      "Here are key takeaways from AP's story on the rise of AI-generated nude images and how schools are responding.",
      "The prosecution stemming from the Louisiana middle school deepfakes is believed to be the first under the state\u2019s new law, said Republican state Sen. Patrick Connick, who authored the legislation.",
      "The law is one of many across the country taking aim at deepfakes. In 2025, at least half the states enacted legislation addressing the use of generative AI to create seemingly realistic, but fabricated, images and sounds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the laws address simulated child sexual abuse material.",
      "Students also have been prosecuted in Florida and Pennsylvania and expelled in places like California. One fifth grade teacher in Texas also was charged with using AI to create child pornography of his students.",
      "Deepfakes started as a way to humiliate political opponents and young starlets. Until the past few years, people needed some technical skills to make them realistic, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University who has written about the issue.",
      "\u201cNow, you can do it on an app, you can download it on social media, and you don\u2019t have to have any technical expertise whatsoever,\u201d he said.",
      "He described the scope of the problem as staggering. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the number of AI-generated child sexual abuse images reported to its cyber tipline soared from 4,700 in 2023 to 440,000 in just the first six months of 2025.",
      "Sameer Hinduja, the co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, recommends that schools update their policies on AI-generated deepfakes and get better at explaining them. That way, he said, \u201cstudents don\u2019t think that the staff, the educators are completely oblivious, which might make them feel like they can act with impunity.\u201d",
      "He said many parents assume that schools are addressing the issue when they aren\u2019t.",

      "AI deepfakes are different from traditional bullying because instead of a nasty text or rumor, there is a video or image that often goes viral and then continues to resurface, creating a cycle of trauma, Alexander said.",

      "The program was meant to help grocers and other retailers learn more about what kinds of prices customers would pay for items, similar to how stores offer different prices for the same products at different locations. But it raised alarms after a report from Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups, Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union, said Instacart offered nearly three out of every four grocery items to shoppers at multiple prices in an experiment.",
      "\u201cAt a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart,\u201d the company said in a Monday blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay \u2013 especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\u201d",

      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways",
      "Every animal with a brain needs sleep \u2014 and even a few without a brain do, too. Humans sleep, birds sleep, whales sleep and even jellyfish sleep.",
      "Sleep is universal \u201ceven though it\u2019s actually very risky,\u201d said Paul-Antoine Libourel, a researcher at the Neuroscience Research Center of Lyon in France.",
      "When animals nod off, they're most vulnerable to sneaky predators. But despite the risks, the need for sleep is so strong that no creature can skip it altogether, even when it's highly inconvenient.",
      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways \u2014 for example, stealing seconds at a time during around-the-clock parenting, getting winks on the wing during long migrations and even dozing while swimming.",
      "For a long time, scientists could only make educated guesses about when wild animals were sleeping, observing when they lay still and closed their eyes. But in recent years, tiny trackers and helmets that measure brain waves \u2014 miniaturized versions of equipment in human sleep labs \u2014 have allowed researchers to glimpse for the first time the varied and sometimes spectacular ways that wild animals snooze.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that sleep is really flexible in response to ecological demands,\u201d said Niels Rattenborg, an animal sleep research specialist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Germany.",

      "Penguin parents face a common challenge: getting enough sleep while keeping a close eye on their newborns.",
      "They survive by taking thousands of catnaps a day \u2014 each averaging just 4 seconds long.",
      "These short \u201cmicrosleeps,\" as Korea Polar Research Institute biologist Won Young Lee calls them, appear to be enough to allow penguin parents to carry out their caregiving duties for weeks within their crowded, noisy colonies.",

      "To remain mostly alert, yet also sneak in sufficient winks, the penguins have evolved an enviable ability to function on extremely fractured sleep \u2014 at least during the breeding season.",

      "In some cases, the answer is yes \u2014 as scientists discovered when they attached devices that measure brain-wave activity to the heads of large seabirds nesting in the Galapagos Islands called great frigatebirds.",
      "While flying, frigatebirds can sleep with one half of the brain at a time. The other half remains semialert so that one eye is still watching for obstacles in their flight path.",
      "This allows the birds to soar for weeks at a time, without touching land or water, which would damage their delicate, non-water repellent feathers.",
      "Frigatebirds can't do tricky maneuvers \u2014 flapping, foraging or diving \u2014 with just one half of their brain. When they dive for prey, they must be fully awake. But in flight, they have evolved to sleep when gliding and circling upward on massive drafts of warm rising air that keep them aloft with minimal effort.",
      "Back at the nest in trees or bushes, frigatebirds change up their nap routine \u2014 they are more likely to sleep with their whole brain at once and for much longer bouts. This suggests their in-flight sleeping is a specific adaptation for extended flying, Rattenborg said.",
      "A few other animals have similar sleeping hacks. Dolphins can sleep with one half of the brain at a time while swimming. Some other birds, including swifts and albatrosses, can sleep in flight, scientists say.",
      "Frigatebirds can fly 255 miles (410 kilometers) a day for more than 40 days, before touching land, other researchers found \u2014 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without being able to sleep on the wing.",
      "On land, life is easy for a 5,000-pound (2,268-kilogram) northern elephant seal. But at sea, sleep is dangerous \u2014 sharks and killer whales that prey on seals are lurking.",
      "These seals go on extended foraging trips, for up to eight months, repeatedly diving to depths of several hundred feet (meters) to catch fish, squid, rays and other sea snacks.",
      "Each deep dive may last around 30 minutes. And for around a third of that time, the seals may be asleep, as research led by Jessica Kendall-Bar of Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed.",
      "Kendall-Bar's team devised a neoprene headcap similar to a swimming cap with equipment to detect motion and seal brain activity during dives, and retrieved the caps with logged data when seals returned to beaches in Northern California.",
      "The 13 female seals studied tended to sleep during the deepest portions of their dives, when they were below the depths that predators usually patrol.",
      "That sleep consisted of both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. During REM, or rapid eye movement sleep, the seals were temporarily paralyzed \u2014 just like humans during this deep-sleep stage \u2014 and their dive motion changed. Instead of a controlled downward glide motion, they sometimes turned upside down and spun in what the researchers called a \u201csleep spiral\u201d during REM sleep.",
      "In the span of 24 hours, the seals at sea slept for around two hours total. (Back on the beach, they averaged around 10 hours.)",
      "Scientists are still learning about all the reasons we sleep \u2014 and just how much we really need.",
      "It's unlikely that any tired human can try these extreme animal sleep hacks. But learning more about how varied napping may be in the wild shows the flexibility of some species. Nature has evolved to make shut-eye possible in even the most precarious situations.",

      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re making accessible is a truth that transforms people,\u201d said Lecrae Moore, a Christian rapper and podcaster. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s happening existentially \u2014 supernaturally \u2014 that I can\u2019t explain.\u201d",
      "Ashley and Moore are among a half-dozen popular influencers who described their work for this story. With and without formal theological they training, they describe themselves as churchgoers who don\u2019t want their messages boxed in by denominational labels.",
      "Some grew up in church; others didn\u2019t, but they commonly describe experiencing a spiritual transformation that came out of hardship or a sense of emptiness they pin on secular lifestyles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like, listen, we\u2019re two mess-ups too. It\u2019s OK,\u201d said Arielle Reitsma, 36, co-host of podcast \u201cGirls Gone Bible,\u201d which gets more than a million listens or streams each month.",
      "These algorithm-savvy podcasters fit comfortably in a long tradition of Christian celebrities, said Zachary Sheldon, a Baylor University lecturer on media, religion and culture who cited televangelist Billy Graham as an example. Working independently, they can harness audiences more easily than established congregations and media organizations can.",
      "\u201cExposing people to the faith and challenging them to ask questions and search for something more\u201d are really good things to do, Sheldon said. But he pointed to \u201cpotential dangers in granting them too much authority on the basis of their celebrity and their acumen with social media.\u201d",
      "These influencers encourage church attendance and describe reaching a variety of people, including those who have been particularly disconnected from religion, which polls show is a growing number of young Americans. Only 41% of people ages 18-35 surveyed in 2023-24 said they believe in God with certainty, down from 65% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cPeople are spiritually hungry, emotionally hungry, and I think for the first time ever \u2026 people are encountering Jesus even through online platforms, and they\u2019re realizing, this is true life and fulfillment,\u201d said Angela Halili, 29, Reitsma's co-host.",
      "The pair now draws live crowds since starting the podcast more than two years ago. At an event in Atlanta, they warned hundreds of fans against idolizing work or relationships, Bibles in hand, and recounted their days as Hollywood actors battling addiction, heartbreak and mental health disorders. Halili said God brought them \u201cradical healing,\u201d and they want listeners to know that God can perform \u201cmiracles\u201d in their lives, too.",
      "Afterward, they hugged and prayed for people in the audience, where Anna Williams, 17, said she considers both Reitsma and Halili to be \u201ca big sister\u201d in her life.",
      "Even as they espouse biblical principles as guidance toward true joy, influencers say that being Christian can be hard.",
      "God \u201cdoes make everything better, but that doesn\u2019t always come in the way that we think it\u2019s gonna come,\u201d said \u201cIn Totality\u201d host Ashley.",
      "Her current obsession, which she teaches with fervor, is a biblical passage about living as a sacrifice. God asks people to give up certain wants and behaviors so they can grow closer to him, Ashley says. She said her intensity grew after a healing encounter with God\u2019s \u201cseverity\u201d as a freshly divorced single mom plagued by suicidal thoughts and depression.",
      "Bible passages, day-to-day plights and heavier challenges are covered on \u201cWith the Perrys,\u201d a podcast led by husband and wife authors and spoken-word artists who also run a streetwear brand.",

      "In a recent episode, the Perrys urged listeners to be honest with God about struggling to trust him.

      "These influencers acknowledge that online Christianity has its challenges.",
      "A hyperfocus on online drama and Christianity's more esoteric beliefs can miss the basics, such as love and Christ's sacrifice, Hill Perry said. She worries that \u201csimply talking about gentleness or respect or kindness or patience is gonna be boring\u201d to people.",
      "And the deep political and cultural rifts among Christians emerge online too.",
      "For example, Halili and Reitsma got pushback for taking the opportunity to pray at a pre-inauguration rally for President Donald Trump. The Perrys have been criticized by conservatives for talking about police brutality and racial injustice, and liberals for expressing opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "Some followers say these influencers provide a welcome alternative to the buttoned-up pastors they grew up with who spoke of God as a faraway deity that would reject them for breaking too many rules.",

Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",

      "Authorities say a prominent California farmer has been arrested on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife",
      "A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, the Navajo County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona.",
      "Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family\u2019s tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.",
      "An attorney for Michael Abatti didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment.",
      "Authorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the Mexican border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops.",
      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region\u2019s early settlers. His father, Ben, helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups.",
      "Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children.",
      "Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles (305 kilometers) northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri\u2019s forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name.",
      "The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death.",

      "The Abattis were sparring over finances with Kerri telling the court the couple had lived an upper-class lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said.",
      "After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn\u2019t maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple\u2019s three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, court filings show.",
      "\u201cI am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,\u201d she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles (450,600 kilometers) on it and sorely needed repairs.",
      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn\u2019t afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",
      "He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700, and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full.",
      "\u201cThe income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,\u201d Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti\u2019s family law attorney, wrote in court papers.",
      "Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show.",
      "He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled \u201cThe Morality of Deceit.\u201d",
      "In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",

      "BRISTOL, Pa. -- Construction crews worked to clear the collapsed walls and roof from a Pennsylvania nursing home Wednesday to help investigators find the cause of an explosion that killed a resident and employee, and set off a dramatic evacuation amid falling debris and shooting flames.",
      "The Tuesday afternoon blast sent 20 others to hospitals, including one person in critical condition. The rest of the employees and 120 residents were accounted for after hours of searching the wreckage, said Police Chief Charles Winik of Bristol Township.",

      "Officials said they didn't yet know the cause of the blast at the Bristol Health & Rehab Center, even though a utility crew had been on site investigating a reported gas leak when the blast occurred. It was so powerful that it shook nearby houses for blocks in Bristol, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of Philadelphia.",
      "A wing of the facility that housed the kitchen and cafeteria was almost entirely destroyed, with the roof caved in, sections of walls completely missing and windows on adjoining walls blown out. Debris littered the grounds.",
      "Winik said the scale of the casualties could have been much worse. Police and firefighters flooded in from the region, as staff from a hospital next door and neighbors rushed to help evacuate the injured. One person was resuscitated at a hospital, officials said.",

      "A federal judge is halting the enforcement of a March presidential memorandum that revoked the security clearance of a prominent Washington attorney",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order \u2014 which also targeted 14 other individuals \u2014 could not be applied to him.",
      "The decision marked the administration\u2019s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of \u201cimproper political retribution\u201d that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.",
      "The March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was \u201cno longer in the national interest.\u201d The list included targets of Trump\u2019s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.",
      "The action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.",
      "In August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded \u2014 or at least tried to \u2014 against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.",
      "Zaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.",

      "Zaid said in a statement, \u201cThis is not just a victory for me, it\u2019s an indictment of the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

      "The lawyers said in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that Combs was treated harshly at sentencing by a federal judge who let evidence surrounding charges he was acquitted of unjustly influence the punishment.",
      "Combs, 56, incarcerated at a federal prison in New Jersey and scheduled for release in May 2028, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at a trial that ended in July. Combs was convicted under the Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime.",
      "Lawyers for Combs said Judge Arun Subramanian acted like a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d in October when he sentenced Combs to four years and two months in prison. They said he erred by letting evidence surrounding the acquitted charges influence the sentence he imposed.",
      "They noted that Combs was convicted of two lesser counts, prostitution offenses that didn\u2019t require force, fraud, or coercion. They asked the appeals court, which has not yet heard oral arguments, to acquit Combs, order his immediate release from prison or direct Subramanian to reduce his sentence.",
      "\u201cDefendants typically get sentenced to less than 15 months for these offenses \u2014 even when coercion, which the jury didn\u2019t find here, is involved,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "\u201cThe judge defied the jury\u2019s verdict and found Combs \u2018coerced,\u2019 \u2018exploited,\u2019 and \u2018forced\u2019 his girlfriends to have sex and led a criminal conspiracy. These judicial findings trumped the verdict and led to the highest sentence ever imposed for any remotely similar defendant,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",

      "GiveDirectly got $50 gift cards out to SNAP recipients during last month\u2019s shutdown through a new approach to cash assistance",
      "Finances already looked tight for Jade Grant and her three children as she entered the year's final months.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s birthday is back-to-back,\u201d the 32-year-old certified nursing assistant said. \u201cYou have holidays coming up. You have Thanksgiving. Everything is right there. And then, boom. No (food) stamps.\u201d",
      "Grant is among the nearly 42 million lower-income Americans who get help buying groceries from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. When the federal shutdown began in October, she wasn't worried about losing her benefits \u2014 she said she is used to government \u201cfoolishness.\u201d",
      "But circumstances got dicey when the budget impasse entered its second month and President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of freezing November SNAP payments. With one child who eats gluten free and another with many allergies, specialty items already drove up her grocery bill. Now Grant wondered how she'd put food on the table \u2014 especially with her youngest's 6th birthday approaching.",
      "Then Grant logged into Propel, an app used by 5 million people to manage their electronic benefits transfers, where she saw a pop-up banner inviting her to apply for a relief program. Within a minute she'd completed a survey and about two days later she got a virtual $50 gift card.",
      "The total didn't come close to her monthly SNAP allotment. But the Palm Bay, Florida, resident said it was enough to buy a customized \u201c Bluey \u201d birthday cake for her son.",
      "Nearly a quarter of a million families got that same cash injection from the nonprofit GiveDirectly as they missed SNAP deposits many need to feed their households. The collaboration with Propel proved to be the largest disaster response in the international cash assistance group's history outside of COVID-19; non-pandemic records were set with the $12 million raised, more than 246,000 beneficiaries enrolled and 5,000 individual donors reached.",
      "Recipients are still recovering from the uncertainty of last month's SNAP delays. Company surveys suggest many are dealing with the long-term consequences of borrowing money in early November when their benefits didn\u2019t arrive on time, according to Propel CEO Jimmy Chen. At a time when users felt the existing safety net had fallen through, they credit the rapid payments for buoying them \u2014 both financially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot. But at the same time, it is a lot,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBecause $50 can do a lot when you don\u2019t have anything.\u201d",
      "It's not the first partnership for the antipoverty nonprofit and for-profit software company. They have previously combined GiveDirectly's fast cash model with Propel's verified user base to get money out to natural disaster survivors \u2014 including $1,000 last year to some households impacted by Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "\u201cThis particular incident with the shutdown we saw as akin to a natural disaster,\" Chen said, \u201cin the sense that it created a really sudden and really acute form of hardship for many Americans across the country.\u201d",
      "The scope differed this time. The \u201cman-made disaster,\u201d as GiveDirectly U.S. Country Director Dustin Palmer put it, was not geographically isolated. The benefits freeze impacted more people than they usually serve. SNAP costs almost $10 billion a month, Palmer said, so they never expected to raise enough money to replace the delayed benefits altogether.",
      "But 5,000 individual donors \u2014 plus $1 million gifts from Propel and New York nonprofit Robin Hood, as well as other major foundations' support \u2014 provided a sizable pot. Palmer found that the issue resonated more than he expected.",
      "GiveDirectly reports that the median donation was $100. Palmer took that response as a sign the issue hit close for many Americans.",
      "\u201cYou and I know SNAP recipients. Maybe we\u2019ve been SNAP recipients,\" Palmer said. \"So that was not a disaster in Central Texas where I\u2019ve never been, but something in our communities.\u201d",
      "The greatest question revolved around the total sum of each cash transfer. Should they reach more people with fewer dollars or vice versa? Los Angeles wildfire survivors, for example, got $3,500 each from a similar GiveDirectly campaign. But that's because they wanted to provide enough to cover a month's worth of lodging and transit to those who lost their houses.",

Propel's software allowed them to send money as soon as the app detected that a family's benefits hadn't arrived at the usual time of the month.",
      "Recipients decided whether their prepaid debit cards arrived physically, which might allow them to take cash out of an ATM, or virtually, which could be used almost immediately. The split is usually pretty even, according to Palmer, but this time more than 90% of recipients went with the virtual option.",
      "\u201cTo me, that speaks to the speed and need for people,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cJust saying, \u2018Oh yeah, I just need food today. I don\u2019t want to wait to get it mailed.\u2019\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- Iran and the United States reaffirmed their commitments to diplomacy at a contentious meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, but the gap between the Trump administration and the Islamic Republic on a nuclear deal remains wide and deep.",
      "The sixth round of negotiations between Washington and Tehran had been scheduled for soon after Israel\u2019s 12-day war with Iran in June, during which the U.S. joined Israel in bombing Iranian nuclear sites. The talks were canceled, and in September Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected any direct nuclear negotiations with the United States.",

      "Several loved ones approached the caskets carrying Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, and William Nathanial Howard, 29. The families huddled together, comforting one another and wiping away tears.

      "In Des Moines, like at Dover, as part of the solemn transfer ritual, fellow Iowa National Guard members wearing white gloves carried the cases. After the families spent several minutes mourning over their loved ones on the tarmac, the caskets were each loaded into a hearse, one blue and the other black.",
      "The two soldiers, posthumously promoted to staff sergeant, were members of the 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry Regiment. Their families followed the hearses in a procession to funeral homes in Des Moines and Marshalltown, escorted by Des Moines Police Department and Iowa State Patrol, respectively. Their funerals will take place in the coming days, according to the Iowa National Guard.",

      "In a social media post after the Tuesday hearing, defense attorney Scott Danks said grand jurors decided not to indict his client, Jacob Lee Bard, for the Dec. 9 shooting and he is out of jail. Bard's attorneys have said that 20 to 30 people had gathered to attack his son and family, and that he was justified in shooting two people who were beating his son.",

      "When the family and an officer reached the dormitory entrance on the move-out day, the group of people in masks and hoods rushed out and began violently assaulting the family and others, including beating the son's head against the pavement, the attorneys said.",
      "In October, the younger son reported a burglary in his dorm room to campus police and received threats of violence afterward, the attorneys said.",
      "Because of continued death threats, the sons are now staying in an undisclosed location, the attorneys added.",
      "\u201cJacob\u2019s actions were absolutely justified under the law, and were the only measure that prevented his son\u2019s death or serious injury,\u201d the attorneys wrote.",

      "A 13-year-old girl at a Louisiana middle school got into a fight with classmates who were sharing AI-generated nude images of her",
      "THIBODAUX, La. -- The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.",
      "The girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they\u2019re viewed, and the adults couldn\u2019t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.",
      "Among the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I got angry,\u201d the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.",
      "Fed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn\u2019t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl\u2019s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.",
      "When the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images \u2014 and not the girl.",
      "The Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives \u2014 at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.",
      "Once again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.",
      "\u201cWhen we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "In Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a \u201cone-sided story\u201d had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.\u201d",
      "After hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends \u2014 one nearly in tears \u2014 to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn\u2019t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn\u2019t normally name victims of sexual crimes.",
      "She was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.",
      "Ultimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cFull nudes with her face put on them\u201d is how the girl\u2019s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.",
      "Until recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, \u201cnudify\u201d it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.",
      "Most schools are \u201cjust kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn\u2019t happening,\u201d said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.",
      "Lafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn\u2019t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.",
      "Although the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn\u2019t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.",
      "The principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.",
      "\u201cI was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,\u201d the girl\u2019s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.",
      "But the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.",
      "Her father says she sent a text message that said, \u201cDad,\u201d and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, \u201cIt\u2019s not getting handled.\u201d",
      "As the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl\u2019s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn\u2019t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.",
      "\u201cKids lie a lot,\u201d responded Coriell, the principal. \u201cThey lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o\u2019clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.\u201d",
      "When the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy\u2019s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.",

      "Video of the fight was posted on Facebook. \u201cOverwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,\u201d the district and sheriff\u2019s office said in their joint statement released in November.",
      "The girl had no past disciplinary problems, but she was assigned to an alternative school as the district moved to expel her for a full semester \u2014 89 school days.",
      "It was on the day of the girl\u2019s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.",
      "The student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.",
      "The girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff\u2019s office described as the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d",
      "At the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl\u2019s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.",
      "The district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students\u2019 disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.",
      "Ultimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe just felt like she was victimized multiple times \u2014 by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "After she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.",
      "Nobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe kind of got left behind,\u201d he said.",
      "Her attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.",
      "By then, so much time had passed that she could have returned to her old school on probation. But because she\u2019d missed assignments before getting treated for depression, the district wanted her to remain at the alternative site another 12 weeks.",
      "For students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again. They become disconnected from their classmates, and they\u2019re more likely to become disengaged from school. They're more likely to have lower grades and lower graduation rates.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s already been out of school enough,\u201d one of the girl's attorneys, Matt Ory, told the board on Nov. 5. \u201cShe is a victim.",
      "\u201cShe,\u201d he repeated, \u201cis a victim.\u201d",
      "Martin, the superintendent, countered: \u201cSometimes in life we can be both victims and perpetrators.\u201d",
      "But the board was swayed. One member, Henry Lafont, said: \u201cThere are a lot of things in that video that I don\u2019t like. But I\u2019m also trying to put into perspective what she went through all day.\u201d They allowed her to return to campus immediately. Her first day back at school was Nov. 7, although she will remain on probation until Jan. 29.",
      "That means no dances, no sports and no extracurricular activities. She already missed out on basketball tryouts, meaning she won\u2019t be able to play this season, her father said. He finds the situation \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was hoping she would make great friends, they would go to the high school together and, you know, it\u2019d keep everybody out of trouble on the right tracks,\u201d her father said. \u201cI think they ruined that.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security has dropped its plan to deport a Chinese national who entered the country illegally, two rights activists said Monday, after his plight raised public concerns that the man, if deported, would be punished by Beijing for helping expose human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer who assisted in the case, said Guan Heng's lawyer received a letter from DHS stating its decision to withdraw its request to send Guan to Uganda. Asat said she now expects Guan\u2019s asylum case to \u201cproceed smoothly and favorably.\u201d",
      "Zhou Fengsuo, executive director of the advocacy group Human Rights in China, also confirmed the administration's decision not to deport Guan. \u201cWe're really happy,\u201d Zhou said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's database lists Guan, 38, as a detainee.",
      "His legal team is working to secure his release from an ICE detention facility in New York on bond, both Zhou and Asat said.",
      "Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, which activists say have been used to lock up as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities in the region, especially the Uyghurs. Beijing has denied allegations of rights abuses and says it has run vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.",
      "Knowing he could not release the video footage while in China, Guan left the mainland in 2021 for Hong Kong and then flew to Ecuador, which at the time did not require visas for Chinese nationals. He then traveled to the Bahamas, where he bought a small inflatable boat and an outboard motor before setting off for Florida, according to the nongovernmental organization Human Rights in China.",
      "After nearly 23 hours at sea, Guan reached the coastline of Florida, according to the group, and his video footage of the detention facilities was released on YouTube, providing further evidence of rights abuse in Xinjiang, the rights group said.",

      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

      "With hits like \"All My Ex's Live in Texas,\" \"Amarillo by Morning\" and \"Check Yes or No,\" George Strait is known as the King of Country Music.",
      "The multiplatinum artist has won dozens of awards from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association, as well as a Grammy for best country album. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006.",
      "When Strait received a lifetime achievement award from the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 2021, he said his father taught him the ways of the cowboy life and that he's tried to hold on to his Western heritage throughout his career. But he also said he was challenged early on to stay true to himself.",

      "A producer also floated the idea that Strait change his name. \"My dad was so glad I didn't do that,\" Strait said.",
      "Gloria Gaynor, the Queen of Disco",
      "Gloria Gaynor's 1978 hit \"I Will Survive\" has stood the test of time, surviving far longer than disco did and crowning the New Jersey singer as the genre's queen.",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording. When it was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2016, the library said \"I Will Survive\" became known as an \"emblem of women's empowerment\" and an anthem in the LGBTQ community.",
      "\"That song taps into the inherent survival instinct and it taps into the tenacity of the human spirit,\" Gaynor told CBS News in 2016.",
      "As she recalled recently, when she recorded the hit, she was paralyzed from the waist down while recovering from a serious spinal injury after a fall onstage.",
      "\"I had been in hospital for over three months, hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I'd survive the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior,\" Gaynor said. \"Yeah, I was living that song, and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one.\"",
      "Legendary rock band Kiss",
      "This year's celebration is a bittersweet moment for the founding members of Kiss. Ace Frehley, the band's original lead guitarist, died in October, just a few weeks after he, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were named among this year's honorees.",
      "\"The saddest thing of all is that Ace couldn't live long enough to see this amazing thing,\" Simmons told CBS News.",
      "Kiss is known as much for their hits like \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" and \"Detroit Rock City\" as they are for their signature black-and-white face paint. The group rode the glam rock wave to stardom, selling more than 100 million records worldwide and entering the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "Simmons and Stanley's partnership has lasted for decades, overcoming the difficulties of making it in the music business.",
      "\"I don't think it's a coincidence that both of us are Jewish and from immigrants who experienced the Holocaust,\" Stanley told CBS News. \"I think that innately we have inside us compassion for other people but also a sense of survival.\"",

      "After winning an Olivier Award \u2014 the U.K. equivalent of the Tony Award \u2014 for musical of the year, the show opened on Broadway in New York in 1988, winning seven Tonys, including best actor in a musical for Crawford.",
      "Crawford's career has also included roles in movies and on television, but he considered those to be auditions for his next part. For him, playing the Phantom was a gift.",
      "\"So, you want to do the eight shows a week,\" Crawford said. \"You don't want to miss one.\"",
      "American icon Sylvester Stallone",
      "Sylvester Stallone wants people to understand one thing about his classic movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"Even to this day, I bristle when I hear it's a sports movie,\" Stallone told CBS News. \"It's not. It's a love story. It starts with love.\"",
      "For Stallone, who received Oscar nominations for playing Rocky Balboa and writing the screenplay for what was named 1976's best picture, the film was about the love between Rocky and Talia Shire's Adrian.",
      "\"This movie will rise and fall on love, not fights,\" Stallone said. \"Everyone can sort of go, oh my God, it's the little things in life, it's the love, it's the nurturing \u2014 that's the victory.\"",
      "Stallone calls the movie his biography when at the time he felt like he couldn't win. He went into acting in his 20s after growing up with his father, who Stallone said was emotionally and physically abusive. Movies were a way for Stallone to cope, and he said the mythic heroes he saw on screen changed his life.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to be that guy,'\" Stallone said. \"I don't want to be what's at the house, but I do want to be this noble creature.\"",
      "New Kennedy Center Honors medallion",
      "The rainbow-colored ribbons adorned with three gold bars that have long been given to honorees were replaced this year with new gold medallions.",

      "O'Day sat down with CBS News for her first network interview since Netflix's new documentary, \"Sean Combs: The Reckoning,\" was released. A clip from the documentary shows O'Day reading from an affidavit that describes an alleged sexual assault involving her, Combs, and another man while she was \"looking very inebriated.\" She says she has no memory of the alleged incident, but it has left her with questions.",
      "O'Day left with questions after shocking affidavit",
      "\"Does this mean I was raped? Is that what this means? I don't even know if I was raped. And I don't want to know,\" said O'Day in the documentary, which has received a reported 40 million views globally in its first two weeks.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesman for Combs said that the music mogul \"categorically denies the allegations in the Netflix documentary,\" saying that \"he has never sexually assaulted anyone.\" Combs plans to address these matters \"in the appropriate legal forum\" rather than \"speculation from anonymous affidavits,\" the statement continued. Combs is currently serving a 50-month sentence in a New Jersey federal prison after being\u00a0convicted on prostitution-related charges.",
      "O'Day once worked closely with Combs, who helped found\u00a0Danity Kane\u00a0on his reality show \"Making the Band\" in 2005 before he ultimately disbanded the group in 2009. Speaking about Combs in the documentary brought up a lot of painful moments for O'Day, who said she's still processing the information.",
      "She wanted to make sure the person who wrote the affidavit is \"100 percent certain\" it was her and that they didn't confuse her with another bandmate or doppelg\u00e4nger.",
      "\"The story that they have told has been consistent for two years in every area that they've been in,\" O'Day said. To this day, O'Day still doesn't know what happened.",
      "O'Day has previously emphasized the role of forgiveness in her journey through the entertainment industry, saying that it starts with forgiving yourself.",
      "\"I forgive myself. That was the hard one,\" she said. \"The feelings that I've had throughout all of this really come down to, like, forgiving myself for misplacing abuse, or attention, or acknowledgment as love. Those weren't one in the same. And so I had to forgive myself first.\"",
      "Living her purpose",
      "When it comes to forgiving Combs, O'Day said it doesn't really matter.",
      "\"Do I forgive him? I don't think that matters to the bigger picture. I think that he needs to do the work to forgive himself,\" O'Day said.",
      "Right now, O'Day said her focus is going to remain on the survivors and pushing for systematic change.",
      "\"I want to be helping people, and speaking for the underdogs, and speaking for the voices that aren't being heard. And I didn't necessarily get to spend the majority of my life yet being able to live in my purpose,\" she said.",
      "Combs is expected to be\u00a0released from prison in May 2028, according to online prison records. While some rumors have swirled about the possibility of a presidential pardon, a senior White House official called the reports \"speculation\" and told CBS News any decisions on pardons would come directly from President Trump.",
      "Marc Agnifilo, the lead attorney for Combs,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" in August\u00a0that he hasn't had any conversations about a possible pardon: \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "O'Day doesn't believe Mr. Trump would pardon Combs.",
      "\"I think the only reason, in my opinion, that the president would pardon 'Diddy' is if it worked well for him in midterms, in regards to gathering a certain voting base,\" she said. \"The moves are always strategic, and the moves right now are about midterms.\"",

      "Manilow, 82, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Instagram that an MRI scan detected \"a cancerous spot\" on one of his lungs after he suffered a lengthy bout of bronchitis in the midst of a residency in Palm Springs, California.",
      "\"As many of you know I recently went through six weeks of bronchitis followed by a relapse of another five weeks. Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK,\" Manilow said in the statement. \"The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed.\"",
      "\"It's pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early,\" Manilow said, adding that he is going to have surgery to have the spot removed.",
      "\"The doctors do not believe it has spread, and I'm taking tests to confirm their diagnosis,\" he said. \"So, that's it. No chemo. No radiation. Just chicken soup and I Love Lucy reruns.\"",

He was scheduled to perform in other U.S. cities on a tour starting in early January. The January shows were slated to take place at arenas in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia, according to the singer's website. Manilow said in his statement Monday they would be pushed back to February, March and April. Manilow's tour will take him to the United Kingdom later in the year.",
      "\"I'm very sorry that you have to change your plans,\" he said.",
      "\"Just like you, we were all looking forward to the January shows and hate having to move everything around,\" he added. \"In the meantime, I'm counting the days until I return to my home away from home at the Westgate Las Vegas for our Valentine's weekend concerts on February 12-13-14 and throughout 2026. Something tells me that February weekend is going to be one big party.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner's circle was wide and eclectic, spanning comedians honing punchlines and Oscar-winning actors and filmmakers shaping Hollywood itself.",
      "As the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, he entered the world of entertainment early, but went on to make a name for himself as a director, filmmaker, and actor in his own right.",
      "He's perhaps best known for his breakout role at age 23 as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in the hit 1970s sitcom \"All in the Family,\" though others may know him more recently as Bob Day, the father of the quirky Jess Day in \"New Girl.\" Reiner also directed iconic films such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "Friends and colleagues who worked with Reiner through the years sat down with CBS News to share their personal anecdotes and fond memories of him following the news of his tragic death. Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14 and their son, Nick, was charged in their murders.",
      "Here's a look at some tributes from those who knew Reiner best, featured in \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" a one-hour special\u00a0broadcast Sunday after \"60 Minutes\" on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Albert Brooks",
      "Albert Brooks said he's still in disbelief over the death of his good friend, who he's known since the pair attended drama class together at Beverly Hills High School more than 60 years ago. He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Kathy Bates",
      "Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates has credited Reiner with changing \"the course of [her] life\" by directing her unforgettable performance as Annie Wilkes in \"Misery\" in 1990.",
      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "She recalled Reiner's enthusiasm when she walked on stage to accept her Oscar for Best Actress in 1991.",
      "\"When they called my name, I looked over and Rob was standing and he was just pounding his fist together going, 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'\" she recalled.",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",
      "\"They had planned to shoot the whole day, and Rob looked at everybody and said, 'I couldn't ask for anything more, so you guys all have the rest of the day off,\" Sutherland said.",
      "Annette Bening",
      "Annette Bening played Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist and love interest of widower President Andrew Shepherd, portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1995 political romantic comedy, \"The American President.\" During filming, Bening said Reiner made it a priority as the movie's director to ensure the cast and crew could spend quality time with their families.",
      "\"On the set, he had that kind of enthusiasm that is infectious. The leader sets the tone, right? So he was wonderful that way. And a real avid family man,\" Bening said.",
      "She added, \"He would insist that the day ended at a sane time, which in show business is kind of unusual. But, he said, 'No, we want everyone to be able to have dinner with their kids.'\"",
      "Michael Douglas",
      "Like Reiner, Michael Douglas was also born to Hollywood royalty, the son of Kirk Douglas.",
      "\"Well, my experience was, watching him, that I could never be the man that my father was. He could do everything, you know, I mean he was Spartacus. Once you go into the same business, it stares you in the face,\" Douglas said. \"And, in Rob's case, are you as funny as your father? But that I think is also what created his tenacity, his strength, and that's something that's not really talked about enough with Rob, about his endurance.\"",
      "Douglas said Reiner was \"spectacular\" to work with in \"The American President.\" \"He was looking out for you,\" he said.",
      "Jerry O'Connell",
      "When Jerry O'Connell was 11, he was cast as the shy but loyal Vern Tessio in the 1986 coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me.\" He met Reiner for the first time at his audition for the film, and recalled Reiner putting him at ease. He said Reiner was like a father figure to him during that time, and the years after.",
      "Months after the movie came out, when he was 12 years old, O'Connell said Reiner took him out to lunch in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He took me out to lunch, man. He didn't have to do that, You know what I'm saying? It was months after the movie came out. He was a busy man, and he took a 12-year-old me out to lunch. Just to be like, 'Thanks so much. What a great movie,'\" O'Connell recalled, with tears in his eyes. \"That lunch meant so much to me, you know? It's just stuff that kids need to hear.\"",
      "Mandy Patinkin",
      "Mandy Patinkin played Inigo Montoya, a Spanish swordsman, in Reiner's 1987 film adaptation of \"The Princess Bride.\" It was the role of a lifetime.",
      "After wrapping up filming, Patinkin said the cast was invited to come out to Los Angeles to see the first rough cut together. When the film was over, Patinkin turned in the screening room and said he \"never dreamed\" he would get to be in something like this.",
      "\"I didn't even have time to dream it. And he made that dream for me. And I don't go anywhere, where some child or adult or grandfather comes up to me and says, 'Say the line,'\" said Patinkin of his famous line, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "The word that came to min when Patinkin heard the news about Reiner and his wife, Michele: \"Inconceivable.\" He said he doesn't know how to process it and he's not looking to understand how to process it.",
      "\"Rob worked hard to try to get me the best human being I could be. One time he said to me, 'I just wish you could get out of your own way.' And I haven't been able to achieve that to this day, but I won't quit trying. He cared about my nature. He showed it to me over and over again,\" Patinkin said. \"I believe that we can connect with Rob and Michele. And every time we're thinking about this or talking about it or anybody tells a story, he's here. He's here with you. He will not be forgotten.\"",

      "Sean Ono Lennon has had a versatile career, as a musician, producer, and songwriter. Asked what part of the musical creation process he likes the most, Lennon replied, \"That's easy: I love writing and recording, and I hate finishing.\"",
      "With his mother, Yoko Ono, now in her 90s, he's added a new job: the custodian of his father's legacy. \"Yeah, technically,\" he said, \"but obviously the world is also the custodian of his legacy, I would say. I'm just doing my best to help make sure that the younger generation doesn't forget about The Beatles and John and Yoko. That's how I look at it.\"",
      "\"Do you think that's even possible?\" I asked.",
      "\"To forget about it? I do, actually,\" Lennon said. \"And I never did before.\"",
      "For his parents' classic, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over),\" Lennon looked for new ways for the song to be heard. \"I wanted to see if I could get that feeling of maybe it sounds like you're hearing it again for the first time, or at least in a new context, in a way that you'd pay attention, as opposed to, 'Oh, there it is on the radio again.'\"",
      "Lennon collaborated with former Pixar animator Dave Mullins to make a short film, \"War Is Over!\" \"We came up with this idea that two soldiers would be playing chess on opposite sides of a war,\" Lennon said. \"I'd also read an article that there were sort of heroic messenger pigeons from World War I and World War II.\"",
      "The 11-minute film, now on YouTube, won an Academy Award last year for best animated short. \"It felt like a Miss Universe pageant or something,\" Lennon said, \"and I was just standing there kind of crying.\"",
      "He used the moment to shout-out his mom: \"So, could everyone please say, 'Happy Mother's Day, Yoko!'\"",
      "\"It's a personal thing\"",
      "Lennon said, \"My parents gave me so much that I think it's the least I can do to try and support their legacy in my lifetime. I feel like I just owe it to them. It's a personal thing.\"",
      "What does he see is their legacy? \"Peace and love,\" he said. \"But it's not just peace and love. It's an attitude towards activism that is done with humor and love.\"",
      "That attitude is visible in the new HBO documentary \"One to One,\" about John and Yoko's 1972 benefit concert at Madison Square Garden \u2013 the only concert John and Yoko had done together. \"The only full-length concert,\" Lennon said, \"certainly the only concert I think that he played a Beatles song, too (\"Come Together\"), because I think he was just in a good mood.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"One to One,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The concert occurred during Lennon's first years in New York, when he was fighting a bitter deportation battle with the Nixon administration, in part because of his anti-war activism.",
      "Featured in the film, said Lennon, were recordings he'd never heard: \"They found these phone calls that my parents had recorded of themselves which, interestingly, was a response to the FBI tapping their phones. So, they thought, 'Well, we need to tap our own phones. Because if they try to say we said something that we didn't say, we'll have our own record of it.'\"",
      "The documentary captures John and Yoko at a critical time in their lives. \"Yeah, and you know, it's my origin story actually,\" said Lennon. \"If you think about it, they came to New York, and that's the only reason I exist.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see something you maybe didn't see before? Or have you seen it all before?\"",
      "\"I hadn't seen all of the home video footage in 'One to One,'\" he said. \"I hadn't heard those phone recordings before. It's like getting more moments to spend with my dad. So actually, for me on a personal level, it just really means a lot.\"",
      "Sean produced the music (also released as a box set). He's working on his own new album, too, his third with the Claypool Lennon Delirium, which he describes as \"kind of a whimsical prog rock, experimental psych band. It's fun!\"",
      "The Claypool Lennon Delirium performs \"Blood and Rockets\":",
      "Lennon and James McCartney (Paul's son) have also been working on a new song with Zak Starkey (Ringo's son), kindling hopes that the \"Children of the Beatles\" might unite.",
      "Asked if they've been offered a gig to play together, Lennon replied, \"Sure. I think people ask for that a lot, but I do think that would be ridiculous. But you know, the reason Zak and James and I made a song together is not because we're trying to redo The Beatles, it's just because we like each other. We're not gonna do it because of some expectation or to, like, fulfill anyone's expectation of what we should do. It has to be natural.\"",
      "Sean Lennon takes his new responsibilities very seriously: \"I think the Beatles' music, and John and Yoko's legacy, is something important for the world to kind of cherish and be reminded of. So, that's how I see my job.\"",
      "Asked how his mother is doing, Lennon said, \"She's good. I mean, you know, she's 92, so she's slowed down a lot, and she's retired. That's why I'm kind of trying to do the work that she used to do. That's why I feel a lot of pressure, actually, to do my best, because she set a high standard for the way that she dealt with my dad's music, and the Beatles stuff. She's always been very singular. And I think my dad was less so. You know, he had Paul to write with, and then he was hoping that my mom would kind of be a writing partner. And I just think it's really funny that, you know, there's probably only one person in the world who would turn down John Lennon as a writing partner, and that's my mom, you know?\"",
      "\"That's probably why he liked her,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, exactly. No, that's exactly right!\" Lennon laughed.",

      "Bowen Yang performed a holiday duet with Ariana Grande for his final act on \"Saturday Night Live,\" as the actor and comedian bid farewell to the sketch comedy show that launched his career.",
      "Yang, 35, had announced his unexpected mid-season departure from \"SNL\" just hours earlier, thanking his colleagues and recapping his tenure on the program in a sentimental Instagram\u00a0post.",
      "\"i loved working at SNL, and most of all i loved the people,\" he wrote in the post. \"i was there at a time when many things in the world started to seem futile, but working at 30 rock taught me the value in showing up anyway when people make it worthwhile.\"",
      "After joining the long-running NBC series as a writer in 2018, Yang began to appear in \"SNL\" sketches over the course of the following season and eventually became part of the main cast in 2021. His promotion marked triumphs for representation on \"SNL\": Yang was the show's first Chinese American cast member and among only several openly LGBTQ comedians ever included in the main cast.",
      "He is now one of its most recognizable faces. Outside of \"SNL,\" Yang hosts the podcast \"Las Culturistas\" alongside fellow actor and comedian Matt Rogers, with whom he also created the spinoff \"Las Culturistas Culture Awards,\" an annual parodied award show that most recently aired on Bravo and Peacock. Yang and Rogers are currently writing and costarring in an untitled new comedy for Searchlight Pictures, according to Deadline.",
      "Yang appeared in the \"Wicked\" movies, which starred Grande, and has amassed a long list of acting credits across television and film. He was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on \"SNL.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"A cappella\" means singing without instruments. But we've come a very long way from monks chanting, to Pentatonix, an a cappella quintet that's won three Grammys and sold 10 million albums. YouTube fans have played their videos more than six billion times.",
      "\"We've just blended together throughout the years just because of how long we've been together,\" said Kirstin Maldonado.",
      "And three of the singers\u2014Maldonado, Scott Hoying and Mitch Grassi\u2014have been together a very long time. \"Mitch and I were in a show together when we were ten,\" said Hoying. \"I met Kirsti in freshman English when we were 14!\"",
      "At their high school in Arlington, Texas, they formed a trio: a soprano, a baritone, and a countertenor. Grassi said of his voice, \"It is incredibly high, and it got made fun of a lot while I was growing up. Yeah, growing up in Texas, you know, it was very different and it's a little feminine, so it was like, 'Get him outta here.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"Our different timbres make such a specific sound when the frequencies of our voices come together, like they all play such a vital role. When they're all together, it feels like this hug. It's really magical, actually.\"",
      "In 2011, they decided to try out for NBC's a cappella competition show \"The Sing-Off.\" But when they learned that bigger groups had better chances, they added a bass, Avi Kaplan, and wanted to add a beatboxer. Hoying said, \"And so, in an act of desperation, we literally went on YouTube and typed in 'beatboxers.' The first video to pop up was a video of Kevin playing cello and beatboxing at the same time.\"",
      "It was Kevin Olusola\u2014cellist, singer, beatboxer, and pre-med student at Yale. Asked what his parents had to say when he quit pre-med to become a musician, Olusola replied, \"It was definitely not the plan!\"",
      "They not only made it onto \"Sing-Off,\" they won the grand prize: $200,000 and a record deal. But within a month, the record company dropped them. Olusola said, \"They asked us, 'Hey, will you guys put any instrumentation behind what you all do?' And we said, 'We literally just won an a cappella TV show.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"We were just like, 'No, we don't like that idea.' And they were like, 'Okay, then we'll drop you.'\"",
      "Instead, they turned to YouTube. Within a year, they had four million subscribers.",
      "\"The video that probably really broke us in terms of the industry would be 'Little Drummer Boy,'\" Olusola said. \"It went to Top 10 of iTunes for four weeks.\"",
      "The higher the Pentatonix star ascended, the harder they worked. Their behind-the-scenes sixth member, co-founder and producer Ben Bram, wrote ever-more spectacular vocal arrangements. Pentatonix released three albums in 2014 alone, and toured for nine months every year.",
      "\"You never got to recharge and be at home, or see your friends or your loved ones,\" said Maldonado. \"It was, like, really, really brutal.\"",
      "So brutal that, in 2017, Avi Kaplan made a stunning announcement: he decided to take a step back from Pentatonix.",
      "\"He didn't really want to tour; he didn't love the tour life,\" said Hoying. \"And we were in our prime and, like, really wanting to tour a lot.\"",
      "After a nationwide search, Pentatonix found its new bass: a Pentatonix superfan from Maryland named Matt Sallee. \"To be able to come into the group and to be able to continue its legacy was something that I cherish very deeply, and I took very seriously,\" Sallee said.",
      "He was prepared: \"I knew everything,\" he said. \"I, like, learned every song, every bass part of every song.\"",
      "\"We were so excited and relieved and grateful that, like, oh, we can see the vision for the future, we can keep this going\" Hoying said.",
      "And they did keep going.",
      "To hear Pentatonix perform \"O Holy Night\" click on the video player below:",
      "I asked, \"You guys have been together\u2014living, traveling, working\u2014for years. You can't tell me there aren't things about each of you that drive others of you crazy?\"",
      "\"Do we have time?\" Sallee replied.",
      "\"There's a lot. There's a lot,\" said Maldonado.",
      "Hoying said, \"We kind of lucked out that none of us are super-reactive.\"",
      "\"I don't think we all have, like, crazy egos that are, like, getting in the way of being able to communicate clearly with each other,\" Maldonado said.",
      "But after 14 years in the spotlight, change was inevitable. Olusola said, \"Everybody's now starting to get married, have kids. So now, what do we want in this stage?\"",
      "What they wanted was to focus on Christmas. Five of their last six albums have all been Christmas music, and their tour is decidedly a holiday show.",
      "And recently, there's been an even bigger change. Their new album, \"Christmas in the City,\" is not a capella! \"I feel like it was time to evolve and do something new,\" said Hoying.",
      "\"Because if you put limits on your artistry, then you won't grow,\" Maldonado added.",
      "But they say they are not abandoning a cappella.",
      "Asked what they think Pentatonix's effect on a cappella has been, Hoying replied, \"I think we've made harmony and singing, I feel like we've been part of what made it cool. There's, like, over 1,200 a cappella groups in colleges now.\"",
      "\"Where before people would either say maybe it's nerdy or, like, not cool or whatever,\" Maldonado said.",

    "summary": "Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz looks back at the work of actor and director Rob Reiner, whose films became part of our shared cinematic language because of their humor, drama, and aching belief in humanity.",
    "story": [
      "In the aftermath of the deaths last weekend of filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz offers an appreciation of Reiner's unparalleled career and life in the movies:",
      "Rob Reiner entered America's collective consciousness in 1971, playing Mike Stivic, Archie Bunker's son-in-law, and politically liberal foil, on \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Mike: \"It's getting like politics in American is only for the rich.\" Archie: \"Who's been feeding you that commie crapola?\" Mike: \"President Eisenhower said that.\" Archie: \"He did not! Eisenhower was a great president who never said nothing.\"",
      "Even then, Reiner knew that, as good as he was in front of the camera, he wanted to direct. His feature debut as a director came in 1984 with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a parody of a documentary that delivered one of the funniest scenes in movie history:",
      "Nigel (Christopher Guest): \"This is very, very special. Because as you can see, the numbers all go to 11. Look, right across the board, 11, 11, 11, 11.\"  Marty: (Reiner): \"And most amps go up to 10?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. \u2026 What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?\"Marty: \"Put it up to 11?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. One louder.\"Marty: \"Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?\"Pause.Nigel: \"These go to 11!\"",
      "\"Spinal Tap\" began an extraordinary run that rivals the best directors in Hollywood history: Seven classic films in just 11 years, each standing the test of time, each possessing some piece of authentic humanity.",
      "In \"Stand By Me,\" an aching moment of friendship between two boys.",
      "In \"The Princess Bride,\" a combination of everlasting love \u2026 and revenge.",
      "Inigo (Mandy Patinkin): \"My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "Three of the movies Reiner made during that run of success contain scenes so perfectly shot, they've become part of our shared cinematic language. First came the diner scene in \"When Harry Met Sally.\" The scene required Meg Ryan to mimic a woman faking an orgasm. After one take, Reiner went to Ryan and explained what he wanted: louder, more hand movements, table pounding. The button on the scene came from Reiner's mother, Estelle: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "Next came Kathy Bates, giving an Oscar-winning performance in \"Misery.\" For the hobbling scene, Reiner gives us James Caan's perspective, tied to the bed, looking up at the benevolent mania of Bates' face.",
      "Finally, in \"A Few Good Men,\" Reiner did the seemingly impossible: directing Jack Nicholson to a performance as memorable as \"Chinatown,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" or \"The Shining.\" Reiner gave us a courtroom drama for the ages, and Nicholson an opportunity to shine in front of a new generation of movie lovers.",
      "Col. Jessup (Jack Nicholson): \"You want answers.\" Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise): \"I think I'm entitled.\" Jessup: \"You want answers?\" Kaffee: \"I want the truth.\" Jessup: \"You can't handle the truth.\"",
      "The truth about Rob Reiner is that, for many Americans, his politics were as well-known as his films, but not always as popular. A fierce critic of President Trump, there's no doubt millions of Americans disagreed (many strongly) with Reiner.",
      "But here's the thing we can all understand about him: Rob Reiner was a patriot, an American who believed deeply in humanity; who believed in trying to make his country work as well as possible for as many human beings as possible.",
      "You can see that aspirational political nature in the last movie of his remarkable run, \"The American President,\" in 1995:",
      "President Shepherd (Michael Douglas): \"You want to claim this land is the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country cannot just be a flag. The symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Now show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms.

    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel \u2014 especially under foot \u2014 and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen \u2014 a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled \u2014 a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-sourced sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",

Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "\"Cruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawaii and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,\" association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement.",

    "title": "We asked experts to rate the U.S. economy in 2025. Here's what they said.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economists-grade-us-economy-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:27:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy remained on track this year, defying the gloomiest predictions. That doesn't mean Americans are thrilled with how things are going.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy has been tested by a barrage of challenges in 2025, from sharply higher U.S. tariffs that drove up inflation and rattled consumer confidence, to rising unemployment amid a slowdown in hiring.",
      "Despite those headwinds, the economy has continued to chug along, defying early-year warnings from some economists that the nation could be headed for a recession or that the Trump administration's tariffs would reignite runaway inflation.",
      "The biggest surprise of the year has been the economy's durability, according to experts. Economic growth has surged\u00a0to its fastest pace in two years, inflation has risen less than feared and the stock market has climbed to\u00a0fresh highs.",
      "\"This has been another year of resilience for the economy,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"The economy has grown at a pretty steady pace.\"",
      "Yet Pearce hastens to add that the economy, although it has navigated some tricky waters, is \"not spectacular\" as the year comes to a close, assigning it a grade of a B or B-. Other experts who spoke with CBS News also graded the economy in the B range.",
      "That may strike many consumers as generous. Three-quarters of Americans surveyed by CBS News earlier this month said they would give the U.S. economy a C, D or F, while just 25% assigned it an A or a B. Recent consumer confidence surveys also indicate that many Americans are downbeat about the economy, mainly due to stubbornly high prices.",
      "The disconnect partly reflects the differences in how consumers and economists tend to judge the nation's economic performance. While financial pros tend to focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation and unemployment, consumers are more likely to assess the economy based on pocketbook issues like food prices and health care costs \u2014 both of which have risen in 2025.",
      "The White House said the economy has improved from last year under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Although much work remains, the American economy is leaps... better now than it was a year ago under Joe Biden: cooled inflation, private-sector job growth, cheaper essentials like gas, lower taxes, and trillions in investments flowing in to make and hire in America,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "He added, \"As President Trump's economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can rest assured that 2026 will be even better.\"",
      "A turbulent year",
      "The economy has been marked by pronounced volatility and uncertainty in 2025, ranging from the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs to an\u00a0alarming downturn in growth\u00a0in the first three months of the year.",
      "\"It's rare that we've seen a president come in and, with a unified Congress, have such immediate impacts on the economy,\" Pearce said. \"Not all of those are impacting the economy right away, but we've seen a lot of those policies generate a lot of uncertainty.\"",
      "For instance, the Republicans' \"big beautiful bill\" act, signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, will likely impact the economy in 2026, with consumers expected to receive juicier tax refunds.",
      "Other effects of the new law could work against some consumers. Perhaps most concerning is the expiration of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which experts warn will sharply drive up health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, it's been a banner year for investors as the boom in artificial intelligence pushed the stock market to a succession of record highs. At the same time, the bullish sentiment on Wall Street has fueled questions about whether a possible\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0could turn to bust if the enormous investment in the technology fails to deliver the promised gains in productivity and corporate profits.",
      "Life on the \"K\"",
      "Economic turmoil often impacts consumer sentiment, making people feel less confident about their finances, economists have long noted. That dynamic has led experts to describe the economy this year as \"K-shaped,\" in which higher-income consumers spend robustly \u2014 thanks in part to the\u00a0strong stock market\u00a0\u2014 even as lower- and middle-income consumers\u00a0pull back.",
      "And it's no wonder. Although inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, prices remain elevated, squeezing many Americans and making it hard for them to cover even basic expenses, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "It isn't just routine purchases that are straining consumers \u2014 it's also the barriers in the way today of reaching once ordinary financial goals, such as buying a first home, saving for retirement or even just paying off debt, added Chen Zhao, head of economic research at online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "When it comes to homeownership, evidence of that barrier is visible in the median age of first homebuyers today \u2014 that hit 40 this year, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. With home values near all-time highs and mortgage rates hovering around 6.3%, many younger Americans are feeling priced out, she said.",
      "\"This situation that we're in right now, where [housing] affordability has gotten to be the worst it's really ever been in recent memory \u2014 and significantly worse than before the pandemic \u2014 it's really unfortunate for the younger generation,\" Zhao said. \"It means delaying the American dream for a lot of folks.\"",
      "In 160 U.S. cities, at least one-fifth of middle-class residents can't afford to live in that area, after factoring in local income levels and price differences, according to Brookings, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Hiring slowdown",
      "Another pressure point is the labor market, where hiring has slowed throughout 2025. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, its highest level in four years.",
      "Layoffs also\u00a0jumped to 1.1 million this year through November, up 54% from a year earlier and the highest level since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "While job seekers are finding it tougher to get a foothold in today's labor market, it's proving particularly challenging for young people, who are facing a decline in job listings and competition from more experienced workers, experts said.",
      "Cooling job growth in the second half of the year is partially a reflection of persistent economic uncertainty, which has led many businesses to throttle hiring. Some businesses are also trimming jobs as they invest in AI, which can perform some tasks previously handled by employees.",
      "\"Any type of uncertainty is going to lead to slower business decisions, whether it's hiring or investment,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Labor market headwinds in 2025 have prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three straight times since September. By lowering borrowing costs, the Fed is aiming to encourage businesses to expand and hire.",
      "Slower hiring and rising layoffs could pose a risk to consumer spending, which drives nearly two-thirds of economic activity, economists note.",
      "\"A slower labor market leads to slower income growth, which eventually ends up pulling consumer spending lower,\" Daco said.",
      "Muted tariff impact",
      "One of the biggest economic surprises of 2025 came with President Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced in April on what he termed \"liberation day.\" The plan caused U.S. stocks to plunge\u00a0and stoked fears that the levies would reignite inflation.",
      "Yet despite such concerns, tariffs so far have had a more muted impact on inflation than initially feared. That's partly because U.S. companies, which pay the import duties to the federal government, stockpiled goods before the tariffs kicked in and absorbed some of the costs rather than passing them on to consumers.",
      "\"Generally speaking, the economy outperformed expectations in the face of several large supply shocks,\" Daco said.",
      "Still, inflation remains sticky. The Consumer Price Index, which stood at 3% in January, remains near the same level as of November. Oxford Economics' Pearce estimates that the stepped-up import duties added 0.5 percentage points to the nation's inflation rate this year.",

      "The average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association (NEADA). Those who use electricity for heating were projected to see an even steeper jump of 12.2%, with the average bill swelling from $1,090 to $1,233, the group found.",

Audits are performed by certified home energy auditors, according to energystar.gov. Look to local government agencies or your utility company for home energy assessment tips.",
      "Tackle obvious leaks. Justin Castronova, a lead inspector at First Choice Inspectors in Illinois, told CBS News consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi that the best place to start is with doors and windows. Castronova recommends using caulk to seal gaps, maintaining weather stripping for doors and windows, and using spray foam around electrical outlets (make sure to turn off your power first).",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security says it's replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with an approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\"The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which was challenged in court.",
      "At least one federal judge has upheld it, French news agency AFP reports. In a 56-page opinion Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote that the president has \"broad statutory authority\" to address \"a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security.\"",
      "At least two additional suits against the fee are ongoing.",
      "The president also rolled out a $1 million \"gold card\" visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \"in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\"",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",
      "The new system will \"implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\" foreign workers, according to Tuesday's press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master's degree or higher.",

    "summary": "A prominent California farmer was arrested in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, authorities said.",
    "story": [
      "A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, the Navajo County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro, Calif. and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona.",
      "Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family's tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.",
      "An attorney for Michael Abatti didn't immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment.",
      "Authorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "A Navajo County grand jury indicted Michael Tuesday and deputies got an arrest warrant for him, CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reported.",
      "El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the Mexican border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops.",
      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region's early settlers. His father, Ben, helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups.",
      "Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children.",
      "Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri's forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name.",
      "The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death.",
      "The Abattis were sparring over finances, with Kerri telling the court the couple had lived an upper-class lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said.",
      "After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn't maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple's three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney's fees, court filings show.",
      "\"I am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,\" she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles on it and sorely needed repairs.",
      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn't afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",
      "He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700 and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full.",
      "\"The income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,\" Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti's family law attorney, wrote in court papers.",
      "Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show.",
      "He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled \"The Morality of Deceit.\"",
      "In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday gave the green light to a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The FDA's approval handed drugmaker Novo Nordisk an edge over rival Eli Lilly in the race to market an obesity pill. Lilly's oral drug, orforglipron, is still under review.",
      "Both pills are GLP-1 drugs that work like widely used injectables to mimic a natural hormone that controls appetite and feelings of fullness.",
      "In recent years, Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound have revolutionized obesity treatment globally and in the U.S., where 100 million people have the chronic disease.",
      "The Wegovy pills are expected to be available within weeks, company officials said. Availability of oral pills to treat obesity could expand the booming market for obesity treatments by broadening access and reducing costs, experts said.",
      "\"I do think that having an oral option would be really helpful, one for improving access, but also as another tool that we can offer patients,\" Dr. Reshmi Srinath, director of the Mount Sinai Weight and Metabolism Management Program in New York, told CBS News.",
      "About 1 in 8 Americans have used injectable GLP-1 drugs, according to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. But many more have trouble affording the costly shots.",
      "\"There's an entire demographic that can benefit from the pills,\" said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert. \"For me, it's not just about who gets it across the finish line first. It's about having these options available to patients.\"",
      "The Novo Nordisk obesity pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide. That's the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic and in Rybelsus, a lower-dose pill approved to treat diabetes in 2019.",
      "How much weight did people lose?",
      "In a clinical trial, participants who took oral Wegovy lost 13.6% of their total body weight on average over about 15 months, compared with a 2.2% loss if they took a placebo, or dummy pill. That's nearly the same as injectable Wegovy, with an average weight loss of about 15%.",
      "Chris Mertens, 35, a pediatric lung doctor in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, joined the Novo Nordisk trial in 2022 and lost about 40 pounds using the Wegovy pill.",
      "\"It was a great option, especially when I know I had tried to do things [in] what people may term 'the right way,' with diet and exercise alone,\" Mertens told CBS News.",
      "The daily medication worked to decrease his appetite and invasive thoughts of food, he said. \"If there were days where I missed a meal, I almost didn't realize it.\"",
      "Before he lost weight, Mertens said, \"I was also seeing effects with things like my blood pressure, with one of my doctors telling me I might need to start medicine for my blood pressure because it was getting high enough, as well as cholesterol being elevated.\"",
      "Participants in the\u00a0clinical trial who took the highest dose of Lilly's orforglipron lost 11.2% of their total body weight on average over nearly 17 months, compared with a 2.1% loss in those who took a placebo.",
      "Both pills resulted in less weight loss than the average achieved with Lilly's Zepbound, or tirzepatide, which targets two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, and led to a 21% average weight loss.",
      "All the GLP-1 drugs, oral or injectable, have similar side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.",
      "Both daily pills promise convenience, but the Wegovy pill must be taken with a sip of water in the morning on an empty stomach, with a 30-minute break before eating or drinking.",
      "That's because Novo Nordisk had to design the pill in a way that prevented the drug from being broken down in the stomach before it could be absorbed by the bloodstream. The drugmaker added an ingredient that protects the medication for about 30 minutes in the gut and makes it easier to take effect.",
      "By contrast, Lilly's orforglipron has no dosing restrictions. That drug is being considered under the FDA's new priority voucher program aimed at cutting drug approval times. A decision is expected by spring.",
      "How much will the Wegovy pills cost?",
      "Producing pills is generally cheaper than making drugs delivered via injections, so the cost for the new oral medications could be lower. The Trump administration earlier this year said officials had worked with drugmakers to negotiate lower prices for the GLP-1 drugs, which can cost upwards of $1,000 a month.",
      "The company said the starting dose would be available for $149 per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be available in January.",
      "It's not clear whether daily pills or weekly injections will be preferred by patients. Although some patients dislike needles, others don't seem to mind the weekly injections, obesity experts said. Mertens turned to injectable Zepbound when he regained weight after the end of the Wegovy pill clinical trial.",
      "He said he liked the discipline of the daily pill.",
      "\"It was a little bit of an intentional routine and a reminder of today I'm taking this so that I know my choices are going to be affected for the day,\" he said.Dr. Angela Fitch, an obesity expert and chief medical officer of knownwell, a health care company, said whatever the format, the biggest benefit will be in making weight-loss medications more widely accessible and affordable.",
      "\"It's all about the price,\" she said. \"Just give me a drug at $100 a month that is relatively effective.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",

    "summary": "Job listings for store Santas have plunged in recent years as more families shop online and retailers look to contain costs, a new analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "As if donning an itchy red suit and entertaining kids all day weren't a tough enough gig, the nation's professional Santa Clauses face another cheer-sapping challenge this holiday season: getting a job.",
      "Job listings for store Santas are down 35% this year, compared with 2024, according to Revelio Labs. Indeed, the number of postings at malls, stores and other outlets has fallen sharply since 2022, the workforce research firm found.",
      "The reasons: Employers are cutting budgets, more malls are closing their doors, and many parents these days choose to avoid the crowds \u2014 and the experience of plopping an unsuspecting toddler on a store Santa's lap \u2014 in favor of online shopping.",
      "The drop in Santa job postings comes amid generally soft holiday-season hiring this year as retailers look to contain costs. The nation's unemployment rate surged to 4.6% in November, the highest in more than four years.",
      "The news isn't all bad for Santa wannabes. Although fewer places are hiring, pay is improving \u2014 the median hourly wage for Santa jobs is now $25, up from $21.89 in 2022, Revelio found.",
      "Then again, employers want only the most qualified candidates. Roughly 70% of listings for store Santas this year require a real beard, according to the firm, up from only 14% three years ago.",
      "\"Economists call this a composition effect: The average salary is changing, not because the actual pay is rising, but because of who's left in the hiring pool,\" Revelio said. \"As employers require real beards for most positions, they're hiring only from the higher-paid tier. Average wages climb, but it's not a story of rising pay. It's a shrinking labor market dressed up as good news.\"",

      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Instacart shelving its AI pricing technology.",

    "story": [
      "American consumers in December remained downbeat about the state of the economy, a new survey shows.",
      "The Conference Board, a nonprofit group representing businesses, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December, from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9. The latest figures are close to the group's reading in April, when President Trump announced tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year's January peak. Four of five components of the overall index fell, while one was at a level signaling notable weakness,\" Dana Peterson, chief Economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "A measure of Americans' short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market remained stable at 70.7, but still well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. It was the 11th consecutive month that reading has come in under 80.",
      "Consumers' assessments of their current economic situation tumbled 9.5 points to 116.8. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers' biggest concern, along with tariffs.",
      "Perceptions of the job market also declined this month. The conference board's survey reported that 26.7% of consumers said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 28.2% in November. Also, 20.8% of consumers said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up from 20.1% last month.",
      "\"Consumers' write-in responses on factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade and politics,\" Peterson said. \"However, December saw increases in mentions of immigration, war and topics related to personal finances \u2014 including interest rates, taxes and income, banks, and insurance.",
      "Americans remain generally sour about the economy, with most grading the nation's economic performance this year as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse, according to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll.",
      "\"Consumer confidence continued to tumble at the end of the year, as higher prices, a weaker labor market and the waning impact of the government shutdown weighed on household perceptions of the economy,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at investment adviser Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Consumers' perceptions of the current state of the economy are at their lowest point in five years,\" he added.",
      "Consumers still spending",
      "Consumer sentiment continued to ebb last month even as the economy accelerated. Federal data released on Tuesday showed the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a blistering 4.3% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter and the strongest rate of growth in two years.",
      "\"The latest GDP data confirm that even though consumer confidence is slipping, consumers are still spending,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a report. \"The disconnect must mean that incomes are rising briskly. \u00a0But the payroll report says incomes are slowing. So the data are not sending a clear message right now.\"",
      "Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy gained a healthy 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March.",

      "An acceleration in consumer spending, along with an upswing in exports and government outlays, helped propel economic growth in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Despite widespread public concerns about the economy, consumers are continuing to open their wallets, government data shows.",

      "Exports grew at an 8.8% rate, while imports, which subtract from GDP, fell another 4.7%.",
      "Inflation ticks higher",
      "Although GDP growth was surprisingly strong, inflation ticked higher from the previous quarter. Tuesday's data shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key barometer of inflation and consumer spending, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, compared with 2.1% between April and June.",
      "Core PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the previous quarter. Both are above the Federal Reserve's annual inflation target of 2%.",
      "The economy has shown resilience this year. While inflation remains higher than the Fed would like, consumer prices have not risen as much as many economists initially feared after President Trump unveiled tariffs earlier this year. Some retailers have cushioned the blow for shoppers by absorbing the added costs, while others have passed them on through higher prices.",
      "The labor market remains a weak spot, with employment numbers showing a slowdown in hiring during the second half of 2025. In November, the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021.",

    "summary": "Analysts point to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as driving the year-end surge.",
    "story": [
      "Gold prices soared above $4,400 on Monday to reach a new all-time high, as analysts pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as key drivers of the surge.",
      "The price of the precious metal traded at\u00a0 $4,475 per ounce at 4 p.m. EDT after hitting a high of $4,477 per ounce earlier in the day. The asset has risen more than 70% since the start of this year. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation.",
      "\"The metals trade has been strong all year, and particularly for gold,\" Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, told CBS News. \"As its fundamentals remain intact, gold digested its recent rally to all-time highs quite well.\"",
      "Silver prices were also rallying on Monday, reaching $69 by 4 p.m. EDT. The metal is up 130% since the start of the year.",
      "Both gold and silver are on pace to reach all-time closing highs today, according to analysts. The rally comes amid expectations for a strong finish in the\u00a0stock market, where tech gains have helped boost performance.",
      "What's driving the surge in gold prices?",
      "Investors are moving money into gold due to a swirl of geopolitical factors, analysts note.",
      "Bond yields around the world floated higher at the same time major global currencies like the yen weakened, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at online brokerage platform FxPro, said in a statement. The combination is reviving interest in the so-called \"debasement trade\" \u2014 a strategy of moving money out of fiat currencies in favor of hard assets like gold, he noted.",
      "Other geopolitical risks, including the U.S. blockade of oil supplies from Venezuela and Ukraine's attack on a Russian shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, were also pushing investors toward gold on Monday, Kuptsikevich added.",
      "Softer monetary policy may also be driving the upswing in gold prices this year, with investors more bullish after three consecutive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many on Wall Street expect the central bank to continue to ease monetary policy in 2026, while President Trump is set to nominate a new central bank chief before Fed chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"The latest leg of the rally has been driven by the market pricing in an increasingly gold-friendly 2026 outlook, with lower rates and a potentially softer dollar acting as tailwinds for the bullion,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs, a New York-based investment company.",
      "Central banks in multiple countries are also buying more gold, Yates added, helping drive up the asset's price.",
      "Demand for the precious metal from monetary authorities like the National Bank of Poland has risen in recent months, according to the World Gold Council, a trade association for the gold industry. Central bank gold purchases through October totaled 254 tonnes, a slower pace than the previous three years, the World Gold Council said earlier this month.",
      "Yates said central bank holdings are still far below their historical levels.",
      "What's the forecast for gold in 2026?",
      "Despite investor exuberance this year, the gold rally may not continue its run in 2026, according to Capital Economics. The investment advisory firm predicted in a Monday research note that the price of the precious metal could fall to $3,500 by the end of next year \u2014 and that the drop will act as a drag on silver prices.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-ban-new-foreign-made-drones-china-balks/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Communications Commission says it's banning new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones out of the U.S. market.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \"crazy\" and \"unexpected\" that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \"The way it's written is a blanket statement,\" Erickson said. \"There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.",
      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",
      "The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn't reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as \"environmentally friendly\" and compliant with emissions standards.",
      "The agreement is still subject to court approval.",
      "Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz USA already agreed in 2020 to pay $1.5 billion to the U.S. government and California state regulators to resolve the emissions cheating allegations.",
      "Mercedes-Benz issued a statement saying the deal announced Monday will resolve all remaining legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions in the United States, but the company still considers the accusations unfounded and denies any liability. The automaker has made \"sufficient provisions\" for the cost of the settlement, the statement said.",
      "Fifty attorneys general, including the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, made up the coalition announced Monday. California was not part of the group.",
      "The settlement calls for the automaker to pay the attorneys general $120 million with another $29 million payment suspended and potentially waived pending completion of a consumer relief program.",
      "That effort will extend to the roughly 40,000 vehicles with the devices that hadn't been repaired or permanently removed from the road by Aug. 1, 2023. The owners of those vehicles would get $2,000 per vehicle if they install approved emissions modification software and an extended warranty.",
      "The settlement also calls for Mercedes to comply with reporting requirements and refrain from any further unfair or deceptive marketing or sale of diesel vehicles.",
      "Volkswagen also ended up paying $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case due to emissions cheating.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:21:16 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has approved a preliminary agreement for a class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples as they do with heterosexual couples.",
    "story": [
      "Like many young girls, Mara Berton and June Higginbotham both knew from an early age they wanted families and to become mothers. But as lesbians, they were excluded from accessing the same fertility treatment insurance benefits offered to heterosexual peers.",
      "Instead, like many other same-sex couples, Berton and Higginbotham, who live in California, had to pay $45,000 out of pocket to conceive while heterosexual colleagues with the same insurance plan had many of those costs covered.",
      "\"We knew it wasn't right,\" Berton said in an exclusive interview with CalMatters. She joined a class action lawsuit challenging the policy. \"What we're fighting for is about family building and having kids ... It was really important to both of us, I think, that other couples not have to do this.\"",
      "Last week, in a landmark settlement, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California Haywood Gilliam Jr. approved a preliminary agreement for the class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples \u2014 like artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization \u2014 as they do with heterosexual couples. It is the first case requiring a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees. An estimated 2.8 million LGBTQ members will benefit, including 91,000 Californians.",
      "Under the settlement, Aetna will also pay at least $2 million in damages to California-based members who qualify. Those who may be eligible must submit a claim by June 29, 2026.",
      "\"I truly hope that this is the first of many insurers to change their policy,\" said Alison Tanner, senior litigation counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center. \"We were looking at that as an issue of inequality \u2014 that folks who were in same-sex relationships were being treated differently.\"",
      "Roughly 9 million additional Californians will soon have access to mandated fertility benefits under a new law taking effect in January. The law applies to state-regulated plans \u2014 which Aetna is not in this case \u2014 and amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people.",
      "Previously, Aetna's policy required enrollees to engage in six to 12 months of \"unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse\" without conceiving before qualifying for fertility benefits, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women \"without a male partner\" to access benefits only after undergoing six to 12 cycles of artificial insemination unsuccessfully depending on age.",
      "Lawyers argued that the policy fundamentally treated LGBTQ members differently and effectively denied them access to the benefit, which can be prohibitively expensive for many people.",
      "In an email, Aetna spokesperson Phillip Blando said the plan provides infertility benefits in accordance with each member's plan, coverage rules and applicable law.",
      "\"Aetna is committed to equal access to infertility coverage and reproductive health coverage for all its members, and we will continue to strive toward improving access to services for our entire membership,\" Blando said.",
      "Berton, who was the lead plaintiff in the case, said she was blindsided by the policy. She had consulted with a fertility clinic and decided to move forward with donor sperm and artificial insemination, when a representative from Aetna called and said she did not meet the definition of infertility.",
      "She appealed the decision multiple times; she was rejected. The experience felt \"dehumanizing,\" her wife Higginbotham said.",
      "Insurance had dictated Berton attempt 12 rounds of artificial insemination before she would be eligible for benefits. Her doctors recommended no more than four rounds.",
      "Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a policy like that could only be designed to dissuade people from accessing their health benefits. Doctors typically recommend three to four cycles of artificial insemination before IVF, but Tipton said there have also been studies showing it is more efficient and cost effective to go straight to IVF.",
      "In 2023, the society updated its medical definition of infertility to include LGBTQ folks and individuals who don't have partners. They did so in part to stop insurers from denying claims like Berton and Higginbotham's.",
      "\"The driving force was a realization that it takes two kinds of gametes to have kids,\" Tipton said. \"Regardless of the cause of that absence, you have to have access in order to be treated for a fertility issue.\"",
      "Since the definition changed, Tipton said more employers and insurers are covering benefits for LGBTQ folks or single people. They have also leveraged the definition to enact statewide benefits expansions, including California's upcoming fertility benefits mandate.",
      "Berton and Higginbotham said they also worried about running out of donor sperm that matched Higginbotham's Jewish and Native American heritage \u2014 and was limited in supply.",
      "\"I don't feel like your insurance should be involved in those types of decisions and kind of determine your journey,\" Berton said.",
      "The couple pulled together money from family members and decided to proceed even without coverage. After four unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, they moved on to IVF, partially to give themselves the best chance of conceiving with the donor they chose.",
      "The experience was \"all consuming\" and emotionally difficult as Berton endured hormone injections, egg retrievals and a miscarriage. But today, she and Higginbotham have two healthy twin girls whose favorite thing is to play on the swings and \"take every book off of their shelf\" for their mothers to read.",
      "The couple achieved their family dreams before the lawsuit concluded. Even so, Higginbotham said she hopes the settlement will help other LGBTQ couples across the country.",
      "\"I know people that don't have children, that wanted children, because the stuff isn't covered. I know people that their timeline was delayed and maybe they have fewer kids than they wanted,\" Higginbotham said. \"The settlement is such a huge step forward that is really righting a huge wrong.\"",

      "Jim Beam will continue to distill at its Fred B. Noe craft distillery in Clermont and Booker Noe distillery in Boston, Kentucky.",
      "The pause comes amid several challenges in the wine and spirits industry. Americans overall are drinking less, with Gallup finding that the share of U.S. adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, near a 90-year low.",
      "Exports of U.S.-produced spirits fell 9% in the second quarter, partly due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, according to an October report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. Exports to Canada were particularly hard hit, declining by 85% during the period, after Canadian retailers pulled U.S. spirits from shelves in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs, the group noted.",
      "Through August, whiskey distillers had produced 55 million fewer proof gallons this year than a year ago, a decline of 28%, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A proof gallon is one U.S. gallon of liquid that is 50% proof alcohol.",
      "Whiskey connoisseurs may not have to worry about supplies running low. Kentucky warehouses now hold a record 16.1 million barrels of aging bourbon, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. The total \u2014 reported in October \u2014 marks the highest level since the repeal of Prohibition and reflects a 27% increase from 2024, the group said.",
      "The surge in bourbon supplies is partly due to an increase in the number of distillers located in Kentucky, the group said. But the industry is also witnessing a dip in demand due to uncertainty over tariffs, declining exports and shifts in drinking habits, it added.",
      "Bourbon, a type of whiskey, must adhere to U.S. distilling laws to be labeled as such. For instance, the liquor must be aged in new, charred oak containers and the grain recipe must be at least 51% corn, according to whiskey tourism site Bourbon Country.",

    "story": [
      "In a TikTok video, then-17-year-old actor Symonne Harrison unveils a bathroom counter full of products from the skincare brand Drunk Elephant that would retail for at least $700 total.",
      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "ALSO READ:\u00a0California bill targeting anti-aging skincare sales to minors dies without vote | \"Sephora kids\" investigation",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted.

    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",
      "\"Medicaid has prices that are much higher than what other European nations pay,\" a senior administration official said. \"Americans should not pay more than other developed nations.\"",
      "But injectable drugs and infusion medications will not be available on TrumpRx because the White House has concluded these drugs must be administered by health care providers and should not be on a direct-to-consumer platform.",

    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",

      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",
      "DraftKings said its app, which is expected to be available in major app stores within days, will connect with multiple exchanges, starting with the derivatives marketplace CME Group.",
      "Once they have a DraftKings account, users can enter the DraftKings Predictions app and start trading by clicking on the yes/no questions associated with an event, such as an NFL game, and deciding how much money they want to wager.",

    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "The center's president, Richard Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

      "President Trump spent part of Christmas Eve bantering with kids about their Christmas lists, updating families about Santa Claus' whereabouts and reminding one child who wavered on leaving out cookies that the big guy has a \"serious appetite.\"",
      "The president and first lady Melania Trump, who are at Mar-a-Lago for the holidays, fielded calls that were routed through the North American Aerospace Defense Command, whose annual Santa-tracking hotline\u00a0received nearly 400,000 calls last year. NORAD also runs an online service that logs Santa's route across the globe.",
      "Asked by one 10-year-old from Oklahoma how NORAD keeps track of St. Nick, the president said, \"We track Santa all over the world. We want to make sure that Santa is being good.\"",
      "Mr. Trump continued: \"We want to make sure that he's not infiltrated, that we're not infiltrating into our country a bad Santa. So we found out that Santa is good.\"",
      "That child's 4-year-old sister told the president that she wants a dollhouse for Christmas. Mr. Trump predicted that she'll get what she's looking for, telling her mother, \"I think we can work that out.\"",
      "\"We owe a lot to Santa, so I think Santa will fulfill your wish,\" he said.",
      "Later on, as NORAD showed Santa passing somewhere over Sweden, the president told an 8-year-old from Kansas wondering when St. Nick would arrive at her home that he should \"make it in record time, probably in about 5 hours.\"",
      "The Kansan told the president she didn't want to end up with coal under the Christmas tree. Mr. Trump responded with one of his oft-repeated slogans: \"You mean clean, beautiful coal?\"",
      "A 10-year-old and a 6-year-old told the president they want a Kindle reader and a pinball machine, respectively. The president was impressed by both gifts.",
      "\"You know Elton John? He did 'Pinball Wizard,'\" Mr. Trump said, referencing a tune that was originally performed by The Who, but covered by John\u00a0for the film adaptation of their album \"Tommy.\" \"We'll have to send you a copy of 'Pinball Wizard.'\"",
      "To the reader, Mr. Trump said: \"Oh wow, that's pretty good. You must be a high-IQ person. We need more high-IQ people in the country.\"",
      "Tempting fate, one 8-year-old from North Carolina asked Mr. Trump if Santa will get upset if she doesn't leave out milk and cookies the night before Christmas.",
      "The president's advice?",
      "\"I would leave them. I think Santa has a serious appetite.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier in the call: \"He won't get mad, but I think he'll be very disappointed. Santa's \u2014 he tends to be a little bit on the cherubic side. You know what cherubic means? A little on the heavy side. I think Santa would like some cookies.\"",
      "NORAD has tracked Santa's progress every Christmas Eve since 1955 \u2014 and the past few presidents have taken a handful of the Colorado-based military command's calls.",
      "In 2018, Mr. Trump asked one 7-year-old if she still believes in Santa. When she answered in the affirmative, he joked: \"Because at 7, that's marginal, right?\"",
      "And three years later, a father ended his call with former President Joe Biden by saying \"let's go Brandon,\" using a coded insult for the then-president. Biden responded: \"Let's go Brandon, I agree.\"",
      "During this year's event, the president spent about 20 minutes taking calls from families, followed by a series of calls to U.S. military service members who are on duty over the holiday.",
      "Mr. Trump later penned a Christmas Eve message on Truth Social that struck a less conciliatory tone, with attacks on the \"Radical  Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country\" and references to this week's stronger-than-expected\u00a0GDP numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump also briefly touted the GDP report at one point between Santa-tracking calls, but he conceded: \"I don't think the kids are too interested in that.\"",

      "Trump-backed candidate Nasry Asfura won Honduras' presidential election, the country's electoral authorities said Wednesday afternoon, ending a weeks-long count.",
      "The election result has continued a swing to the right in parts of Latin America, just a week after Chile chose the far-right politician Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast as its next president.",
      "Asfura, of the conservative National Party, received 40.27% of the vote in the Nov. 30, edging out four-time candidate Salvador Nasralla of the conservative Liberal Party, who finished with 39.39% of the vote.",
      "Asfura won in his second bid for the presidency, after he and Nasralla were neck-and-neck during a long vote count that fueled international concern over the Central American nation's fragile electoral system.",
      "On Tuesday night, a number of electoral officials and candidates were already fighting and contesting the results of the election. Meanwhile, followers in Asfura's campaign headquarters erupted into cheers.",
      "\"Honduras: I am prepared to govern,\" wrote Asfura, the former mayor of Honduras' capital Tegucigalpa, in a post on X shortly after the results were released. \"I will not let you down.\"",
      "The results were a rebuke of the current leftist leader and her governing democratic socialist Liberty and Re-foundation Party, known as LIBRE, whose candidate finished in a distant third place with 19.19% of the vote.",
      "Asfura ran as a pragmatic politician, pointing to his popular infrastructure projects in the capital. President Trump endorsed the 67-year-old conservative just days before the vote, saying he was the only Honduran candidate the U.S. administration would work with.",
      "\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Late last month, Mr. Trump also\u00a0pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez \u2014 a National Party member \u2014 on drug trafficking and weapons charges, allowing him to leave a U.S. federal prison. The U.S. president claimed Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly,\" but his decision drew criticism from some members of both parties.",
      "Nasralla has alleged that the election was fraudulent and called for a recount of all the votes just hours before the official results were announced.",
      "On Tuesday night, he addressed Mr. Trump in a post on X, writing: \"Mr. President, your endorsed candidate in Honduras is complicit in silencing the votes of our citizens. If he is truly worthy of your backing, if his hands are clean, if he has nothing to fear, then why doesn't he allow for every vote to be counted?\"",
      "He and others opponents of Asfura have maintained that Mr. Trump's last-minute endorsement was an act of electoral interference that ultimately swung the results of the vote.",
      "The unexpectedly tumultuous election was also marred by a sluggish vote count, which fueled even more accusations.",
      "The Central American nation was stuck in limbo for more than three weeks as vote-counting by electoral authorities lagged, and at one point was paralyzed after a special count of final vote tallies was called, fueling warnings by international leaders.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Organization of American States Secretary General Albert Rambin on Monday made an \"urgent call\" to Honduran authorities to wrap up a special count of the final votes before a deadline of Dec. 30. The Trump administration warned that any attempts to obstruct or delay the electoral count would be met with \"consequences.\"",
      "For the incumbent, progressive President Xiomara Castro, the election marked a political reckoning. She was elected in 2021 on a promise to reduce violence and root out corruption.",
      "She was among a group of progressive leaders in Latin American who were elected on a hopeful message of change around five years ago, but are now being cast out after failing to deliver on their vision. Castro said last week that she would accept the results of the elections even after she claimed that Mr. Trump's actions in the election amounted to an \"electoral coup.\"",
      "But Eric Olson, an independent international observer during the Honduran election with the Seattle International Foundation, and other observers said that the rejection of Castro and her party was so definitive that they had little room to contest the results.",
      "\"Very few people, even within LIBRE, believe they won the election. What they will say is there's been fraud, that there has been intervention by Donald Trump, that we we should tear up the elections and vote again,\" Olson said. \"But they're not saying 'we won the elections.'

      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled Tuesday night that \"the government's retribution\" against Zaid was \"carried out by summarily canceling the attorney's security clearance without any of the process that is afforded to others.\" Ali said the administration had not conducted an individualized national security assessment of Zaid's clearance before stripping him of it.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sometimes wrecking balls and bulldozers move faster than the legal system.",
      "That's the dilemma facing the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which lost its bid to temporarily halt construction of the White House ballroom last week. A judge sided with President Trump, allowing work to continue on the East Wing site while imposing limited requirements on the administration.",
      "\"The American people own these places. And we, the American people, have a right to weigh in when significant changes to them are proposed,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the Trust, said in an interview with CBS News. \"This project needs to follow the already legally mandated processes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overhauled parts of the White House at a sprinter's pace and with virtually no oversight. The East Wing and the corridor connecting it to the main residence were dismantled in a matter of days in October.",
      "Mr. Trump's next architectural adventure is anyone's guess, but it appears there's little standing in his way.",
      "Quillen said she has \"deep concern\" about future projects. The Trust's lawsuit seeks a judicial declaration that would impose pre-demolition requirements on White House construction so that more pieces of the building are not disappeared before experts and the public have a chance to weigh in.",
      "The White House argues the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project is not yet far enough along to require approval from entities that typically have oversight of federal construction in Washington, D.C. Construction plans, government lawyers told the court, have not been finalized.",
      "As for future projects at the executive mansion, a White House official said, \"There are no plans for any demolition of any structures at this time.\"",
      "Quillen said there was a silver lining in Judge Richard Leon's ruling against the Trust.",
      "\"We view the judge's order as really helpful. And we learned a lot and it actually facilitates our aims in the suit,\" Quillen said.",
      "While ruling against the Trust, Leon ordered the government to file construction plans with the National Capital Planning Commission and Commission of Fine Arts by the end of the month \u2014 something the White House had already signaled it intended to do.",
      "The administration has argued that it has no obligation to file construction plans with the NCPC prior to demolition because the commission's authority, it says, only applies to vertical construction \u2014 not demolition.",
      "The government also produced a previously unpublished environmental assessment of the ballroom. That document provided some details about the project's scope, timeline and the steps taken to preserve and prepare White House grounds for the 90,000-square-foot addition. The National Park Service completed the assessment in August, but it was not released until last week in a court filing.",
      "The Trust is also asking the court to enforce a law that would require ballroom construction to obtain congressional approval. The law holds that, \"A building or structure shall not be erected on any reservation, park, or public grounds of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia without express authority of Congress.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans, who hold a majority in both houses, have yet to take a formal interest in the ballroom. The $400 million project is privately financed, and thus far no congressional appropriation or approval resolution is under consideration.",
      "The White House maintains the president has the unilateral authority to build on White House grounds.",
      "Quillen argues that because the White House has so far operated outside the process typically required for other federal construction in Washington, experts and the public have been excluded from providing pre-demolition input, and history could be lost.",
      "\"When projects like this go through these processes, the outcome ends up being better. The people have a voice. You build more support for the project. It becomes a more lasting legacy and improvements can be made to it along the way,\" Quillen said.",
      "The National Capital Planning Commission is slated to hear a presentation on the ballroom on Jan. 8. Another court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 15.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security says it's replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with an approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\"The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which was challenged in court.",
      "At least one federal judge has upheld it, French news agency AFP reports. In a 56-page opinion Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote that the president has \"broad statutory authority\" to address \"a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security.\"",
      "At least two additional suits against the fee are ongoing.",
      "The president also rolled out a $1 million \"gold card\" visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \"in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\"",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",
      "The new system will \"implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\" foreign workers, according to Tuesday's press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master's degree or higher.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The declaration issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone's gender expression doesn't match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited. After taking office in January, President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to cut federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors' offices,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS's declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",
      "Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.",
      "The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers \u2014 and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules \u2014 one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.",
      "The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.",
      "Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Mr. Trump returned to office \u2014 even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first time the Supreme Court had waded into the issue of health care for transgender youth.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18.",
      "The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.",
      "Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania's Democratic governor also joined.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",

    "summary": "President Trump invoked a law called Title 10 to bring members of the Illinois National Guard under federal service over the objections of state and local leaders.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by the Trump administration to deploy National Guard members to the Chicago area while a legal challenge moves forward, delivering a setback to President Trump in his effort to use federalized troops in Illinois to ensure enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "The high court left untouched a judge's decision blocking the government from putting National Guard members on the streets of Chicago and surrounding areas. The Trump administration had urged the Supreme Court to allow the extraordinary move to deploy the troops over the objection of Illinois' Democratic governor, arguing that federal courts cannot second-guess the president's decision to call the National Guard into federal service.",
      "But the Supreme Court declined the administration's request to freeze that order in a decision that appears to be 6-3. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented.",
      "In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court found that \"at least in this posture\" the Trump administration has not met its burden to show that Title 10, the law Mr. Trump invoked, permits him to federalize the National Guard \"in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement calling the ruling \"a big win for Illinois and American democracy.\"\u00a0Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson praised the Supreme Court for \"rebuking President Trump's attempts to militarize and demonize our city.\"",
      "The White House said nothing in the high court's ruling detracts from the president's agenda.",
      "\"The president promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. \"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property. Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has brought state-run National Guards under federal control in several U.S. cities as his administration has ramped up immigration enforcement operations. Mr. Trump has so far moved to deploy National Guard units in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago to protect federal property and personnel, and he has threatened to send troops to other major cities, including Baltimore and San Francisco.",
      "Two West Virginia National Guard members who were sent to Washington, D.C., were shot in an ambush-style attack near the White House last month. One of the victims died and the other was severely wounded.",
      "As for Illinois, the president issued a memo in early October claiming that federal facilities in the state \"have come under coordinated assault by violent groups intent on obstructing federal law enforcement activities,\" which he said hindered the execution of U.S. immigration laws.",
      "The directive came after the processing center for immigrant detainees in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, saw a rise in protests following the launch of an immigration enforcement campaign called Operation Midway Blitz in early September.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump authorized the federalization of the Illinois National Guard under\u00a0Title 10. The law allows the president to call into federal service members of a state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the \"regular forces\" or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "Roughly 300 troops from the Illinois National Guard prepared to mobilize. Federalized members of the Texas and California National Guards also arrived in Illinois in early October but have since left the state.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker objected to the president's move, arguing that there was no public safety need that required the deployment of National Guard troops. The state of Illinois and city of Chicago then sued the Trump administration, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization of the National Guard is illegal. They sought a temporary order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area.",
      "U.S. District Judge April Perry sided with Illinois officials and issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from ordering the federalization and deployment of the National Guard within Illinois. In her October decision, she called information from Department of Homeland Security officials about events in Illinois \"unreliable.\"",
      "\"There has been no showing that the civil power has failed,\" Perry wrote. \"The agitators who have violated the law by attacking federal authorities have been arrested. The courts are open, and the marshals are ready to see that any sentences of imprisonment are carried out. Resort to the military to execute the laws is not called for.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit then allowed the Guard members to remain under federal service, but upheld the portion of Perry's order forbidding them from being sent out to the Chicago area.",
      "In their decision, the 7th Circuit judges found that the Trump administration failed to satisfy the conditions for invoking Title 10 to call the National Guard into federal service in Illinois.",
      "\"Political opposition is not rebellion,\" the 7th Circuit judges wrote. \"A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protestors advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows.\"",
      "The 7th Circuit also found there is \"insufficient evidence\" that the demonstrations in Illinois have hampered the ability of federal officers to enforce immigration laws.",
      "\"Federal facilities, including the processing facility in Broadview, have remained open despite regular demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies,\" the judges said. \"And though federal officers have encountered sporadic disruptions, they have been quickly contained by local, state, and federal authorities.\"",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration argued that courts cannot review the president's decision to call up the National Guard.",
      "\"A federal district court lacks not only the authority but also the competence to wrest control of the military chain of command from the Commander in Chief and to adjudicate whether the Governor of Illinois, rather than the President, should be in ultimate command of particular Guardsmen after the President has called them into federal service,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "Sauer also argued violence and threats of violence have impeded immigration enforcement operations and forced the Department of Homeland Security to divert resources away from law enforcement activities to protect federal buildings and officers.",
      "\"The National Guard's deployment would protect lives and federal property, deter acts of violence, free up resources for actual law enforcement, and assist federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties effectively,\" he said.",
      "Illinois officials, meanwhile, argued that state and local law enforcement have effectively handled the protests outside the Broadview facility. They warned that allowing National Guard troops onto the streets in the Chicago area could spark confrontations.",
      "\"[T]he unnecessary deployment of military troops, untrained for local policing, will escalate tensions and undermine the ordinary law enforcement activities of state and local entities, which would need to divert resources to maintain safety and order,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in mid-October, but the high court sought additional information from government lawyers and Illinois officials about whether the term \"regular forces\" refers to the U.S. military.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority concluded that the phrase \"regular forces\" likely means the military, so Title 10 likely applies only where the military can legally execute the laws. Those circumstances are \"exceptional,\" the high court said in its order, since the military is forbidden under a law called the Posse Comitatus Act from engaging in domestic law enforcement, except when authorized by Congress or the Constitution.",
      "\"So before the President can federalize the Guard under [Title 10], he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be 'unable' with those forces to perform that function,\" the court said. \"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois.\"",
      "Beyond Illinois, Mr. Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland has set off legal challenges brought by officials in those states. Two trial court judges in California and Oregon initially blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard units to areas of those states. But separate three-judge panels on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit issued decisions allowing the Trump administration to deploy members of the California National Guard within Los Angeles and the Oregon National Guard in Portland while the legal proceedings continued.",
      "The full 9th Circuit declined to reconsider the panel's decision as to the California National Guard. A district judge in December then again blocked the Trump administration's deployment, and that order has been appealed.",
      "But as to Oregon, a federal judge held a three-day trial and issued a ruling last month finding that the president did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard. She permanently blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland. The Justice Department appealed the decision to the 9th Circuit, and the chief judge for the appeals court allowed the Oregon Guard troops to remain under federal control while proceedings move forward.",
      "While the 9th and 7th Circuits have split on whether Mr. Trump can send National Guard troops into cities, they agree that courts can review the president's use of Title 10 to call the units into federal service.",
      "In Washington, D.C., a federal judge ruled last month that his National Guard deployment there violates federal law. The judge paused her decision for 21 days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.",

    "summary": "A federal judge gave the Trump administration two weeks to submit a plan to either return a group of men previously held at a notorious Salvadoran prison to the U.S., or give them a hearing to contest allegations of gang membership.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday gave the Trump administration two weeks to submit a plan to either return a group of Venezuelan men previously held at a notorious Salvadoran prison to the U.S., or give them a hearing to contest allegations of gang membership.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg issued the order after finding that 137 Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and held at the infamous CECOT megaprison had been denied their due process rights. Boasberg determined that the men were in the legal custody of the U.S. during the months they spent detained at CECOT, and that they should've been given a chance to challenge the Trump administration's allegations that they were gang members.",
      "\"On the merits, the Court concludes that this class was denied their due-process rights and will thus require the Government to facilitate their ability to obtain such hearing. Our law requires no less,\" Boasberg wrote in his opinion Monday.",
      "The group of 137 men who could benefit from the ruling is a subset of more than 200 Venezuelan deportees sent to CECOT in March, some of whom were deported to El Salvador under traditional immigration procedures. All of the Venezuelan men held at CECOT were released this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap.",
      "Boasberg said the U.S. government could comply with his order by allowing the men to return to the U.S. or otherwise offering them a hearing. The administration, he wrote, could \"theoretically offer Plaintiffs a hearing without returning them to the United States so long as such hearing satisfied the requirements of due process.\"",
      "Boasberg gave the government until Jan. 5 to file a plan to comply with his order.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said \"Judge Boasberg is way over his skis.\"",
      "\"He has been shut down by appellate courts again and again on this case,\" she added. \"We look forward to continuing to defend our actions in court.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the men ceased to be in U.S. custody after they were sent to El Salvador, so U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction to hear legal claims challenging their detention. But Boasberg wrote that the U.S. effectively maintained control over the men because El Salvador held them in prison at the U.S.'s behest, and the administration paid for them to be detained at CECOT.",
      "The first group of Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were deported on March 15, soon after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act and declared alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang enemies of the state who could be detained and deported with little to no due process.",
      "At the time, Trump administration officials called the deportees dangerous criminals, terrorists and gangsters.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT on March 15. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",
      "A report released last month by human rights groups determined that the treatment of the Venezuelan deportees imprisoned at CECOT amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse.",
      "Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the former CECOT prisoners in court, lauded Monday's order.",
      "\"After enduring months of torture, these men will finally get the due process they deserve, notwithstanding the Trump administration's underhanded attempts to deny them any opportunity to content the accusations that they are gang members,\" he said.",

    "summary": "ICE has filed more than 8,000 requests to toss out asylum claims in immigration court, asking judges to send immigrants to third-party countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has mounted a nationwide campaign to void the asylum claims of thousands of immigrants with active cases in immigration court by arguing that they can be deported to countries that are not their own, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "The effort appears to have intensified in recent weeks, targeting asylum-seekers with pending cases in immigration courts in Atlanta, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas and elsewhere across the U.S., multiple immigration lawyers and certified legal representatives told CBS News.",
      "Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch. Instead, they are administrative entities run by the Justice Department, which employs and oversees the judges that adjudicate the cases of people facing deportation. Lawyers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement represent the government in the proceedings.",
      "The administration's new tactic involves ICE attorneys asking the immigration judges to toss out asylum claims without hearing them on the merits. In these requests, known as \"pretermit\" motions, ICE argues that asylum-seekers fearing persecution in their home countries can instead be deported to one of several nations the Trump administration has persuaded to accept deportees who are not their citizens.",
      "As part of the effort, ICE attorneys have asked immigration judges to order asylum-seekers deported to third countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News and interviews with immigration lawyers. If granted, those petitions nullify asylum-seekers' claims and clear the way for them to be deported to third countries, absent any appeals.",
      "Previously undisclosed internal government data obtained by CBS News indicates that, as of early December, ICE attorneys had filed more than 8,000 motions in immigration court to toss out asylum claims by citing deportation agreements with third countries.",
      "The campaign is the latest move by President Trump to sharply curtail access to the American asylum system, which his administration has argued is being systematically abused by migrants who came to the U.S. for economic reasons, especially those who entered illegally along the southern border under the Biden administration.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration is \"working to get illegal aliens out of our country as quickly as possible while ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,\" the department added, citing \"lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strategy rests on a section of immigration law that disqualifies migrants from asylum if the applicant is eligible to request legal protection in another nation that has agreed to a \"safe third country\" arrangement with the U.S.",
      "In late October, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which reviews decisions by immigration courts, issued a ruling that lawyers believe will turbocharge efforts by the government to use \"safe third country\" agreements to cancel asylum cases. That order directed immigration judges to decide the motions by ICE to send immigrants to third-party countries before reviewing their asylum applications. It also placed the burden on asylum-seekers to prove they should not be sent to a third country because of fears of being persecuted there.",
      "\"You just have to give up\"",
      "While the Trump administration has argued its latest effort is meant to curb asylum fraud, multiple immigration lawyers told CBS News the campaign has affected clients with strong asylum claims who fled persecution in countries like Iran, Nicaragua and Russia.",
      "The attorneys argued the government's campaign is designed to eliminate the path to asylum in the U.S. Some said it is meant to coerce asylum-seekers into withdrawing their claims, by scaring them with the prospect of being deported to a country that is not their own.",
      "\"They see the asylum system as a whole as a problem, because it impedes them from deporting people in a quick manner,\" said Pa\u00fal Pirela, an immigration lawyer in Houston.",
      "\"If you want to apply for asylum, we're forcing you to apply in a country that you've never been to,\" Pirela continued. \"You just have to give up and go back to your country or go somewhere else,\" he added later.",
      "Pirela said one of his clients, a Nicaraguan asylum-seeker and political dissident, was ordered deported to Honduras after the government filed a pretermit motion in his case. ICE, he added, is also trying to get another client, an asylum applicant from Guatemala, ordered deported to Honduras.",
      "Atlanta immigration attorney Adriana Heffley got notice that DHS had motioned to pretermit her client's case and deport him to Uganda four days before a hearing, she told CBS News. Her client is from Iran, and was apprehended at the border when he entered the U.S. illegally last December, she said. He has been detained ever since.",
      "Heffley and her client had prepared a case arguing that he would face persecution and danger in Iran as someone who had previously been in same-sex relationships. But they had to switch gears and quickly prove he would also suffer in Uganda. The judge agreed and denied the DHS motion to preempt the case.",
      "\"Immigrants who are coming up on a hearing that will determine the course of the rest of their lives and their fate and their safety are being hit with this left-field motion just a day or two before that final hearing,\" Heffley said.",
      "New York immigration attorney David Treyster is not confident his case will see the same outcome. DHS moved to deport his client, a Russian national, and her 4-year-old child, to Uganda, he told CBS News. The judge initially planned to give Treyster 30 minutes to confer with her before hearing opposing arguments and ruling on the motion. After pleading with the judge, Treyster was able to schedule the hearing for Tuesday.",
      "The judge \"seemed to imply that her hands are being tied,\" he said, given the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling that the third-country deportations must be considered first. \"We haven't even had our hearing, [but] the judge kept saying, 'you're going to have to appeal this.'\"",
      "\"The person timely and properly applied for asylum and is in line waiting their turn, doing everything that the administration wants people to do, reporting to their court hearings, filing all their papers on time, and here we are just taking that due process away from them,\" Treyster added.",
      "Some immigration attorneys are challenging the tactic in court, including the 2019 regulation that ICE attorneys have been citing in their motions arguing that asylum-seekers can be deported to third countries.",
      "\"I think that this is in line with this administration's attempt to completely eviscerate the availability of asylum and other forms of protection in this country,\" said Blaine Bookey, legal director for San Francisco's Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, one of the groups litigating the case. \"This is, in their view, an easy way to cut off a case at the knees.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department has disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department began disclosing\u00a0thousands of files and photos\u00a0related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, Dec. 19, with additional batches released in subsequent days, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors for more transparency into the government's investigations into the disgraced financier.",
      "The records were released in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed last month and required the government to release virtually all Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said more files will be released \"over the next couple of weeks,\" even though the law required the documents to be disclosed by Friday. He later told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed more time to pore through the records and redact victims' names.",
      "Congressional Democrats have accused the Justice Department of failing to comply with the law, arguing that the documents are too heavily redacted and should have been released in full on Friday.",
      "Where to find the Epstein files",
      "The files that have been disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act are available on the Justice Department's website, broken into different data sets. Many of the files are photos, not text documents.",
      "CBS News is also uploading the records to a searchable database, which is available here.",
      "Here are the Justice Department's records:",

      "What's in the new Epstein files?",
      "Thousands of the files are images, including photos that were seemingly taken in Epstein's mansion in Manhattan or his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those include photos of his bedroom in New York, his risque wall art and a taxidermied tiger.",
      "Many photos show Epstein socializing with his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also appears in several of the images \u2014 in some cases, the former president is posing with celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Clinton traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but says he was not aware of Epstein's crimes, and accused the Justice Department of trying to scapegoat Clinton on Friday.",
      "Some of the photos are redacted \u2014 in certain cases, they show Epstein posing with people whose faces are obscured.",
      "There are also a number of investigative documents, some of which have heavy redactions. In a few cases, documents are almost entirely redacted.",
      "Why were some of the Epstein files redacted?",
      "The law that requires the Justice Department to release the files only allows redactions under narrow circumstances, including to take out Epstein survivors' personal information, violent images or child sexual abuse material. The government is also allowed to temporarily withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Records cannot be withheld solely because they would cause \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"",
      "Some redactions in the documents released Friday appeared to omit victims' names, but the exact reasons for every redaction are unclear. The law also requires the department to give Congress a list of its redactions within 15 days.",
      "What was Epstein investigated for and charged with?",
      "The files that were released Friday are expected to stem from the litany of investigations surrounding Epstein and Maxwell, stretching back at least 20 years.",
      "Allegations about Epstein's conduct appeared to emerge on the government's radar as early as the 1990s, when survivor Maria Farmer says she reported to the FBI that Epstein had abused her. In a lawsuit, she has accused the government of failing to look into her allegations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by local police in Florida and federal prosecutors starting in the mid-2000s. That probe ended with a controversial 2007 deal in which federal prosecutors in Miami agreed not to charge him, in exchange for a guilty plea on prostitution charges in state court.",
      "More than a decade later, Epstein was charged in New York federal court with abusing and trafficking dozens of underage girls. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking conspiracy the following year, and was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "Files from several other probes could be made public. The government has investigated the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019, officially ruled a suicide. And it has investigated Miami prosecutors' decision to cut a non-prosecution deal.",
      "Why the Epstein files are being released now",
      "The files are being released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in November. The legislation gave the attorney general 30 days to publicly release documents related to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the government's investigations into both and internal records about the cases.",
      "The legislation was the result of years of pressure from Epstein and Maxwell's survivors, who pushed lawmakers for more transparency about how the government handled both of their cases. Epstein's death fueled conspiracy theories about his connections to high-powered figures in government and the business world.",
      "The calls for transparency reached new heights over the summer. The Justice Department conducted a review of the Epstein files in the government's possession, and concluded that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he had blackmailed prominent figures. The findings infuriated many of the president's supporters who had been calling for the release of the Epstein files for years, and opened the door for a bipartisan push to unveil the records.",
      "California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, was the lead sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He introduced the bill in July, and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky filed a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on the measure. The push was delayed by opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the government shutdown in the fall. But in November, the petition received the final signature required to bring the bill up for a vote.",
      "It passed the House by a vote of 427 to 1 and the Senate unanimously approved it. President Trump signed it into law on Nov. 19, despite spending months pressuring Republicans to oppose it, starting the clock on the 30-day deadline.",
      "In the wake of Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, three separate judges approved Justice Department requests to unseal grand jury transcripts from investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. One of those rulings stemmed from grand jury proceedings in South Florida in 2005 and 2007. Epstein ultimately escaped federal charges there and instead agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.",
      "The other two court orders came from judges in New York, where Epstein and Maxwell were charged in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
      "When will the next group of Epstein files be released?",
      "It's unclear. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News earlier Friday that the department would release more files \"over the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "\"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected \u2014 is completely protected,\" Blanche said.",
      "That timeline does not comply with the law, which required the release of all eligible files by Dec. 19. The department's office of public affairs said before Friday's release that the \"initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"",
      "Blanche's comments, and the department's failure to release all of the files, angered many Democrats who have harshly criticized the administration for its handling of the documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of violating the law and suggested they could take legal action.",
      "\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin and Garcia said in a joint statement. \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena. The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\"",
      "Raskin and Garcia said they are \"examining all legal options\" given Blanche's earlier admission.",
      "\"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department is facing continued backlash over its partial releases of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with lawmakers and survivors denouncing the limited scope of the disclosures.",
      "The Trump administration faced a Dec. 19 deadline to release most of the government's records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law last month. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the files will be released on a rolling basis over the coming weeks due to the volume of the materials and the need to shield the personal information of survivors.",
      "A first tranche of records was made public Friday, followed by a second batch Saturday. Many of the documents contained significant redactions, including whole pages of records that were blacked out.",
      "Early Tuesday, the department released tens of thousands of additional documents from the files. It wasn't immediately clear what impact that release would have on the criticism of the earlier releases.",
      "The Justice Department also removed more than a dozen of the earlier files without an initial explanation. The department said on X on Saturday that files would continue to be \"reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the removed files was an image of a group of framed photos, including two that appeared to show Mr. Trump. The department said on Sunday that the file was \"temporarily removed\" out of an abundance of caution after federal prosecutors in New York flagged it \"for potential further action to protect victims.\" The department reposted the photo after it said a review determined that \"there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph.\" Mr. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein.",
      "A group of survivors of abuse by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate who was convicted of sex trafficking, called on Congress to hold hearings and take legal action to demand compliance with the law. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "\"It is alarming that the United States Department of Justice, the very agency tasked with upholding the law, has violated the law, both by withholding massive quantities of documents, and by failing to redact survivor identities,\" they said in a statement Monday.",
      "The survivors said the government released \"a fraction of the files,\" and said the material that was disclosed was \"riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution Monday that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes in the new year.",
      "Schumer called the Justice Department's rollout a \"blatant cover-up,\" claiming Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche \"are shielding Donald Trump from accountability, and the Senate has a duty to act.\"",
      "\"The law Congress passed is crystal clear: release the Epstein files in full so Americans can see the truth,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "Bondi said in a post on X on Sunday\u00a0that the Justice Department \"will bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims,\" and urged any survivors with information to come forward.",
      "But in July, the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that a review of the government's files related to Epstein \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna expressed dissatisfaction with the release on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday. Khanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, authored the Epstein legislation and worked together on the discharge petition to force a vote on the measure.",
      "Massie said he and Khanna are \"talking about and drafting\" a resolution to hold Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress, which he called \"the quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims.\"",
      "Inherent contempt is a rarely used tool that Congress can use to enforce compliance with its directives. A 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service called it a \"long dormant\" power that allows lawmakers \"to detain and imprison a contemnor until the individual complies with congressional demands.\" The report noted that while there \"may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines\" as an alternative, there's no precedent for Congress imposing a fine for contempt.",
      "Last year, a push by GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida to hold then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in inherent contempt fell short in the House. Though she had initially signaled that she was pursuing a resolution to hold Garland in custody, the final measure would have imposed a fine of $10,000 per day on Garland for defying a congressional subpoena.",
      "Khanna said he and Massie are \"building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.\" To force a vote on the House floor upon the chamber's return next month, the resolution would likely be offered as a privileged motion, which would require leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general had 30 days from its enactment to make public \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" in the Justice Department's possession that related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The law prohibited the government from withholding, delaying or redacting records \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" But it did allow the attorney general to redact certain portions of documents, including personally identifiable information of survivors or depictions of child sexual abuse.",
      "The law also requires the Justice Department to provide written justification for any redactions to Congress.",
      "The president, asked about the Epstein documents at an event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Monday, voiced frustration that there is still so much attention focused on them.",
      "\"I believe they gave over 100,000 pages of documents,\" he said. \"And there is tremendous backlash, it's an interesting question, because a lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they're in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin a reputation of somebody. So a lot of people are very angry that this continues.\"",
      "Epstein was under investigation in South Florida in the early 2000s, but ultimately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Miami to escape federal charges. He agreed to instead plead guilty to state prostitution charges and serve 18 months in prison.",
      "He was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019 and died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility weeks later.",

      "The U.S. military says it struck a vessel that was allegedly carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific on Monday, killing one person \u2014 part of a months-long campaign of boat strikes near Latin America.",
      "The military has hit at least 29 alleged drug vessels since early September, killing 105 people. President Trump has argued that boat strikes have been effective at quelling drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, but critics have questioned the president's legal authority to carry out the strikes.",
      "Monday's strike targeted a vessel in international waters that was \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes,\" the U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X. The military said the boat was operated by a designated terrorist organization \u2014 it did not specify the organization, but the Trump administration has categorized several Latin American drug cartels as terror groups.",
      "The military called the target of Monday's operation a \"low-profile vessel.\" Narcotics trafficking groups have\u00a0long been accused of using submarines and semi-submersible \"low-profile\" boats to transport drugs in certain cases. In October, Mr. Trump announced a strike against an alleged drug-trafficking submarine in the Caribbean, killing two people and leaving two survivors who were repatriated to their home countries.",
      "On Dec. 22, at the direction of @SecWar Pete Hegseth, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a low-profile vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations in international waters.

      "The strikes have drawn pushback from congressional Democrats and a handful of Republicans who argue the operations haven't been authorized by Congress and the administration hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the vessels were carrying drugs.

      "President Trump said Monday that the release of thousands of photos from the government's files on Jeffrey Epstein risked ensnaring \"highly respected\" people with no connection to the late sex offender's crimes, in the president's first public remarks since the files were released last week.",
      "The congressionally mandated releases brought to light images of former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, among others. Epstein was known for cultivating relationships with the rich and powerful, and he socialized with both Clinton and Mr. Trump at various points \u2014 though neither man has been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "Asked Monday what he thought about the emergence of photos of Clinton, Mr. Trump called it \"terrible\" and said he's \"always gotten along\" with the former president \u2014 and argued other people who appear in the photos could be unfairly tarred.",
      "\"I don't like the pictures of Bill Clinton being shown. I don't like the pictures of other people being shown.

      "The Justice Department began releasing records on Epstein on Friday, a deadline set by Congress last month in the bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act that was signed by Mr. Trump. The department has said it plans to release more files \"on a rolling basis\" over the next few weeks, despite the law's Dec. 19 deadline, citing the need to redact victims' names and other information from documents.",
      "The files include decades' worth of material from the federal government's investigations into Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, but died by suicide in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted of trafficking. Epstein was also investigated by federal prosecutors in the 2000s, but in a controversial move, he avoided federal charges in exchange for a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in Florida.",
      "Mr. Trump encouraged GOP members to vote for the law after deriding Republicans who pushed for more information on the government's Epstein investigations, calling Democrats' fixation on the issue a \"hoax\" and arguing Democrats were using it as a distraction.",
      "The president's reservations about the issue appeared to still linger on Monday.",
      "\"I hate to see photos come out of [Clinton], but this is what the Democrats, mostly Democrats, and a couple of bad Republicans are asking for,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to the four House Republicans who joined with Democrats in forcing a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.",
      "Mr. Trump ran in some of the same social circles as Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, but the two had a falling out. The White House has said in the past\u00a0that the president kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago for acting like a \"creep.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled with Epstein on multiple occasions, but added he never went to Epstein's island. Clinton has said he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes. On Monday, Clinton spokesperson Angel Ure\u00f1a called on the government to release all additional photographs or records that include the former president, arguing he has nothing to hide.",
      "\"[W]hat the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why,\" Ure\u00f1a said in a statement. \"But we do know this: We need no such protection.\"",

    "summary": "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S. this month.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is still pursuing a sanctioned oil tanker in international waters, a U.S. official told CBS News on Monday, as the Trump administration appeared to intensify its targeting of oil vessels amid a pressure campaign directed at the Venezuelan government.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker, called the Bella 1, over the weekend, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official said.",
      "But the ship \u2014 which had not yet entered Venezuelan waters \u2014 refused to be boarded and sailed away, fleeing toward the Caribbean. An active pursuit began, with the vessel sending distress signals to nearby ships. That pursuit remained underway as of Monday afternoon, according to the official.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Sunday the pursuit involved \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion.\"",
      "\"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said.",
      "The Coast Guard's pursuit of the tanker was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters did not give a specific location for the operation or the name of the vessel being pursued.",
      "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S.\u00a0this month.",
      "In a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries. A U.S. official told CBS News that the interdiction of the vessel followed a similar playbook to an earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
      "And earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0called The Skipper that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the tanker seized on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",
      "\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" he added. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"",
      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is pushing for more information on a White House ballroom project championed by President Trump, sending a series of letters Monday to the project's architect and some attendees of a fundraising dinner.",
      "The White House disclosed a partial list of those who attended the October 15 dinner, which was held to recognize financial contributors to the $400 million ballroom project. CBS News obtained a more complete list of invitees through sources.",
      "Blumenthal\u00a0asked several reported attendees who weren't on the official list\u00a0how they decided whether to donate and how much to give. He also asks if they were given the option to stay off the White House-released list, and if so, why they chose to remain anonymous.",
      "David Baszucki, the CEO of game company Roblox, did not appear on the White House list, but did attend the dinner. Blumenthal asks Baszucki to confirm in writing that he donated $5 million to back the ballroom, an amount not previously reported. The senator writes that Baszucki told him about the donation during a meeting.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson said Baszucki donated to the non-profit organization supporting the ballroom project in his personal capacity \u2014 but declined to specify the amount.",
      "Blumenthal also sent letters to Trish Duggan, a wealthy Republican donor; Robert Goldstein, CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp.; Carey Smith, Parsons Corp. CEO; Dan Gilbert, Rocket Companies Chairman; Steve Rudder; Cliff Sims, a former White House official; John Solomon, Just The News editor-in-chief; TV personality Greta Van Susteren and her husband; and Geoff Verhoff, a lobbyist.",
      "Not all of the fundraising dinner's attendees have confirmed that they donated.",
      "\"Many of the donors have deep financial, business, or other personal interests before the Administration,\" Blumenthal wrote, arguing that Americans are entitled to \"all the relevant facts about who is funding the most substantial construction project at the White House in recent history.\"",
      "Roblox has faced criticism for insufficient child protections on its platform, and members of Congress have taken note. It also faces a wave of state lawsuits accusing the company of exposing minors to potentially harmful content. Tennessee sued Roblox as recently as last week.",
      "Since the October dinner, the company announced new child safety measures. Roblox has said it dedicates \"substantial resources\" to finding and taking down inappropriate content.",
      "Democrats lack subpoena power in Congress, so Blumenthal's asks amount to a request rather than a binding demand.",
      "Blumenthal also wrote to the architect who took over the ballroom project after tensions between Mr. Trump and the original architect became public.",
      "Shalom Baranes, a D.C.-based architect, was hired in early December. So far the White House has declined to share details about its financial arrangement with the firm.",
      "Blumenthal's letter asks for Baranes to provide details about how he became involved in the project, whether there is a contract between Baranes and the government and if he has shared design plans.",

      "The Interior Department didn't disclose the specific security issues raised by the Defense Department, instead pointing to unclassified federal reports that have found wind projects can create risks because the movement of turbine blades, combined with their reflective towers, can create radar interference.",
      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",
      "Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged\u00a0Trump's Day One order\u00a0that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.",
      "Halted projects",
      "Vineyard Wind 1, located about 15 miles south of the Massachusetts islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, is slated to include 62 wind turbines, each spaced by one nautical mile apart, according to the project's website. About half of those turbines were operational in October, the Vineyard Times reported that month.",
      "Once fully developed, the project is projected to generate renewable energy for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Revolution Wind, a project located off the coast of Rhode Island, is 80% completed, according to its website. It's operated by renewable energy company Orsted, which didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Dominion Energy's CVOW, which stands for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, is the largest offshore wind project in the U.S., with 176 turbines. The project was projected to be up and running by the end of 2026, according to its website.",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:10:22 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA is gearing up to send four Artemis astronauts on looping test flight around the moon in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Four astronauts in training to fly around the moon early next year strapped into their Orion spacecraft this weekend for a dress rehearsal countdown in a major milestone toward launch.",
      "Based on repeated stops and starts seen on NASA's countdown clock, the complex test originally planned for late November, ran into problems at various points on Saturday. NASA provided no details, but Artemis 2 commander Reid Wiseman said that overall, the test went well.",
      "\"Extremely successful day in our spacecraft #Integrity,\" Wiseman said in a post on X. \"Did everything go perfectly? Absolutely not. But this vehicle and our team showed us they're up to the challenge. Launch is getting very close.\"",
      "Launch is tentatively targeted for early February, but the schedule is extremely tight and the flight may slip to early March. No decisions are expected until after the first of next year.",
      "In any case, Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, wearing bright orange pressure suits, strapped into their Orion capsule using the same procedures they'll follow on launch day.",
      "Such \"countdown demonstration tests\" have traditionally taken place shortly before launch with the rocket and crew ship already on the launch pad. But for Saturday's test, the astronauts boarded their spacecraft atop NASA's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Over the course of the exercise, the astronauts and the launch control team worked through the same countdown procedures they will follow on launch day, ending less than a minute before the clocks would normally hit zero.",
      "Five launch opportunities are available in February when the moon and Earth are in the proper relative positions. The first such opportunity comes on Feb. 6. To make that date, the SLS rocket and Orion would have to be rolled from the assembly building to pad 39B in mid January, setting the stage for a critical fueling test that must go well before NASA can proceed to launch.",
      "Given the amount of work remaining to complete preparations, sources say NASA may opt to delay the flight to early March.",
      "Whenever it takes off, the flight plan calls for the Orion and its crew to spend 25 hours in an elliptical orbit around Earth to test spacecraft life support, propulsion and navigation systems.",
      "The crew plans to fly in close proximity to the SLS rocket's upper stage to test the Orion's maneuvering systems and rendezvous procedures that will be needed for eventual moon landing missions.",
      "An uncrewed Orion carried out a similar loop around the moon during the Artemis 1 mission in November 2022. But the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft was not equipped with a full life support system and it did not carry out thruster firings like those needed for a rendezvous.",
      "Once the testing is complete, the Artemis 2 Orion will leave Earth orbit on a \"free return\" trajectory that will carry the crew around the moon and back to a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The ship will not go into orbit around the moon.",
      "But Artemis 2 will still be the first piloted trip back to the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, carrying Wiseman and his crewmates farther from Earth than any other humans have ever traveled.",
      "The flight will set the stage for Artemis 3, carrying yet-to-be-named astronauts to the surface of the moon near the lunar south pole, NASA hopes, in 2028.",
      "The Artemis 3 flight originally was planned for 2024, a target set during the first Trump administration. But the mission has been repeatedly delayed by processing problems, slowdowns during the COVID pandemic, Super Heavy-Starship testing and work to develop the lunar lander, known by NASA as the Human Landing System, or HLS.",
      "The current 2028 target was set in the past few weeks when it became apparent the space agency would not be ready in time for the most recent previous target of 2027.",
      "China also plans to land its own \"taikonauts\" on the moon by 2030, creating a new space race of sorts, one that NASA vows to win.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:21:27 -0500",
    "summary": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus is the first person with a significant physical handicap to reach space.",
    "story": [
      "In a space-age milestone, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a wheelchair-using engineer and handicap advocate to the edge of space Saturday, a 10-minute trip that allowed her to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness more than 65 miles above Earth.",
      "Michaela Benthaus, a German aerospace engineer who suffered a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident, joined a retired SpaceX manager and four entrepreneurs for the up-and-down flight to a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space.",
      "\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing, joking about turning upside down in weightlessness. \"I didn't only like the view and the microgravity, but I also liked the going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"",
      "Benthaus was assisted during training and inside the Blue Origin capsule by Hans Koenigsmann, a former SpaceX manager and engineer who was instrumental in the development of that company's workhorse Falcon family of rockets.",
      "A fellow German by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen, Koenigsmann helped arrange Benthaus' flight after meeting her last year.",
      "\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Benthaus said in a Blue Origin interview. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?",
      "\"Then he reached out to Blue Origin and told me oh, Blue actually is very excited about it. Okay, I have my doubts on it, but let's see. Thankfully it turned out we can do it. So Hans and me (ended) up flying as a team,\" Benthaus continued.",
      "Koenigsmann said Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time.\"",
      "Benthaus was able to make her own way from her wheelchair into the New Shepard capsule before launch, scooting along a bench extending from the hatch that was provided by Blue Origin. Koenigsmann was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.",
      "Running two days late because of last-minute technical issues, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero Saturday and the New Shepard blasted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch pad at 9:15 a.m. EST.",
      "Accelerating straight up into a mostly clear sky, the capsule's single-stage booster reached a velocity of nearly three times the speed of sound before its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "At that point, the New Shepard capsule was released to continue coasting upward on its own, and the crew, now weightless, was free to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin.",
      "Benthaus' legs were strapped together to keep them in place, but she, too, was free to enjoy the thrill of weightlessness as the New Shepard coasted up to a peak altitude of slightly more than 65 miles, well above the 62-mile-high point where aerodynamic forces no longer have any effect.",
      "At that altitude, the \"sky\" is deep black and Earth's horizon is sharply curved. Passengers are able to take in the view through the largest windows ever flown in space.",
      "\"Oh, my God,\" one passenger could be heard exclaiming over the capsule's radio.",
      "\"Incredible,\" another said.",
      "Falling back into the lower atmosphere, the crew was warned to get back in their seats to strap in before the onset of atmospheric deceleration. Maximum deceleration subjects New Shepard crews to about five times the normal pull of gravity.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, followed a similar trajectory, falling tail first back toward the launch site. Nearing the ground, the BE-3 engine re-ignited, landing legs deployed and the rocket settled to an on-target touchdown on a concrete pad near the launch gantry.",
      "The New Shepard came down under three large parachutes, landing in a cloud of dust near the booster and its launch pad. Blue Origin support personnel quickly reached the spacecraft to help the crew exit.",
      "Joining Benthaus and Koenigsmann aboard the New Shepard were physicist-investor Joey Hyde, entrepreneur Neal Milch, adventurer Jason Stansell and Adonis Pouroulis, a South African entrepreneur and mining engineer.",
      "All six waved, smiling broadly as they climbed out of the capsule one at a time. Benthaus was last out, carried from the spacecraft by Koenigsmann and a member of Blue Origin's recovery team to a nearby wheelchair.",
      "\"You should never give up on your dreams, right?,\" she said after landing. \"I just feel very lucky, and I'm very grateful to Blue and Hans and everyone who said yes to this journey.\"",
      "Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of a New Shepard seat, but the price is thought to be upwards of $500,000 each. How Benthaus' seat was financed was not revealed.",
      "Saturday's launch marked Blue Origin's 16th New Shepard flight with passengers aboard since Bezos, his brother and two others blasted off on the first such flight in July 2021. Including Saturday's flight, Blue Origin has now launched 92 men and women to space, including six who have flown twice.",
      "While Benthaus was the first person with a significant physical handicap to fly in space, European Space Agency astronaut John McFall, who has a prosthetic leg, has been cleared for selection to a future flight to the International Space Station.",
      "Benthaus said before launch the reaction to her flight aboard the New Shepard was mostly positive, saying she hopes more handicapped people might make their way to space.",
      "The big question for NASA and other space agencies and private companies is not so much whether handicapped astronauts can carry out their duties in the weightless environment of space. It's more about how they can handle an emergency that might require a speedy exit from their spacecraft, either on the ground or in space.",
      "In an interview with CNN, Benthaus said \"we're thinking more and more about long-duration space missions; some of us want to go to the Mars in the future.\"",
      "\"That's a very long journey. And, yes, people can get a disability on the way. People can have a stroke or break their leg or get a spinal cord injury.\"",
      "In the end, she said, \"people with disabilities actually bring value to a crew. ... You develop a very special resilience.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/instacart-ends-ai-price-testing-tool-eversight/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:07:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Instacart had drawn criticism for testing an AI-based system that enabled retailers to charge different prices for the same grocery items.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart said Monday that it would halt the use of an AI-powered tool that allowed retailers to charge customers different prices for identical items on the grocery delivery platform.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Instacart shelving its AI pricing technology.",
      "In a separate case last week, Instacart agreed to pay $60 million in customer refunds to settle federal allegations of deceptive practices after the FTC accused Instacart of falsely advertising free deliveries and not clearly disclosing service fees.",

    "story": [
      "Workers with an aptitude for explaining how artificial intelligence tools function in simple terms are more likely to find success in the job market, according to an economist who focuses on the economic impact of AI.",
      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of new job that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",
      "\"AI will change the vast majority of the work we do, but it will affect each occupation in different ways,\" he said. \"A good analogy is to think about computers and the internet and how that changed jobs and the way we work.\"",
      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",
      "Seamans also expects employers to step up their hiring of instructors who can train workers on how to use a company's AI apps. His advice for workers, students and early-career employees?",
      "\"My encouragement would be for everyone to play around with AI and not assume there is one specific way you should be interacting with [AI],\" he said. \"Interact in a variety of ways because you'll get different answers.\"",

    "summary": "Forecasters said Southern California could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned about flash flooding and mudslides, especially in areas scorched by wildfires.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful winter storm swept across California on Wednesday, with heavy rains and gusty winds bringing debris flows that have led to some water rescues and evacuation orders.",
      "Forecasters said Southern California could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned about flash flooding and mudslides. Some areas scorched by January's wildfires were under evacuation orders, and Los Angeles County officials said Tuesday they delivered about 380 evacuation orders to especially vulnerable homes.",
      "Early Wednesday, the L.A. Fire Department said firefighters rescued a man trapped in a drainage tunnel in northwest LA that led down to a river. No injuries were reported, but the man is being evaluated.",
      "Several roadways across the regions were closed due to flooding.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Wednesday for L.A., Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Shasta counties, saying this would enable them to activate emergency authorities and pre-position resources.",
      "Storms began to move in late Tuesday evening and intensified on Christmas Eve. Authorities said the millions of people expected to travel across the state would likely meet hazardous, if not impossible, conditions as several atmospheric rivers were forecast to make their way through the state, the National Weather Service warned.",
      "Conditions could worsen as multiple atmospheric rivers move across the state during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, according to forecasters. The storm in L.A. strengthened throughout the day Wednesday, but was forecast to taper off later in the evening.",
      "An\u00a0atmospheric river\u00a0is a long, narrow band of water vapor that typically forms over an ocean in the tropics. Strong winds create a funnel for the vapor that transports it north or southward, often targeting the California coast, where it is released as rain or snow on land,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Wind gusts exceeded 60 mph in Los Angeles County, knocking down trees and power lines, Ariel Cohen, National Weather Service meteorologist in charge, said, according to CBS Los Angeles. She urged \"everyone to take these warnings and messages seriously as the accumulative effects of the rain will result in increasingly dangerous and life-threatening conditions as we head through the holiday time period.\"",
      "Malibu resident Claire Hamano told CBS Los Angeles on Monday that she was concerned the storm could potentially cause landslides near her home. She was filling her car with sandbags at one of the county's distribution sites in preparation.",
      "\"If there are landslides, let's say on the PCH, we won't be able to get out ... that's kind of my biggest fear,\" said Hamano. \"I'm trying to prevent mud from flowing onto the street on my property.\"",
      "Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said. It could be even more in the mountains. Gusts could reach 60 to 80 mph in parts of the central coast.",
      "In addition to power outages and downed trees, officials also said the storms are expected to cause multiple road closures and airport delays.",
      "Evacuation orders across Southern California",
      "Parts of L.A. and Orange counties in burn scar areas affected by recent wildfires were under evacuation orders,\u00a0CBS Los Angeles reports.",
      "Many people in burn scar areas decided not to leave after receiving an evacuation notice, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell said. He urged them to reconsider.",
      "\"The threat posed by this storm is real and imminent,\" McDonnell said, a warning echoed by L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna.",
      "\"If you decide to stay in your home in an evacuated area...it could be difficult to leave once the storm begins,\" Luna said Tuesday.",
      "Los Angeles County put up K-rails, a type of barrier, around a burn scar to help catch sliding debris during rainstorms. Residents could also pick up free sandbags to protect their homes, said Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles County supervisor representing Altadena, much of which was torched by the devastating Eaton Fire last January.",
      "Brinda Kimpton, whose home survived the Eaton Fire, told CBS News she was growing nervous about the rains, but despite calls to evacuate, had decided to ride out the storm for the time being.",
      "\"The mud debris came down, and it's breached the K-rails,\" she said Wednesday, later adding that \"it's been a hell of a year.\"",
      "Local and state officials are gearing up to respond to emergencies through the week. The state has deployed resources and first responders to a number of counties along the coast and in Southern California. The California National Guard is also on standby to assist.",
      "L.A. County mountain community hard-hit by storm",
      "San Bernardino County firefighters said Wednesday they rescued people trapped in their cars when mud and debris rushed down a road leading into Wrightwood, a mountain resort town in the San Gabriel Mountains about 80 miles northeast of Los Angeles. It's not immediately clear how many were rescued.",
      "Debris and mud were seen cascading down a local road in a video posted by county fire officials. Another video showed fast-moving water rushing through the front porch of several homes.",
      "The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department\u00a0issued a shelter in place order for Wrightwood on Wednesday afternoon. Highway 2 leading into Wrightwood was washed out due to flooding, the San Bernardino Fire County Fire Department reported.",
      "The storm stranded Dillan Brown with his wife and 14-month-old daughter at a rented cabin in Wrightwood on Wednesday with almost no food and only enough diapers for about another day. By the morning, the roads leading off the mountain \u2014 and to a grocery store \u2014 were already blocked by rocks and debris, Brown said.",
      "\"I came across (a road) where there was a car sucked away by the water and realized we were trapped here,\" Brown said.",
      "A local resident learned of his situation and posted a call for help in a Facebook group. In less than an hour, neighbors showed up with more than enough supplies to ride out the storm \u2014 bread, vegetables, milk, diapers and wipes, he said.",
      "\"I think we're a little sad and upset that we're not going to be home with our families,\" Brown said, but the \"kindness shown is definitely an overwhelming feeling.\"",
      "A 2024 wildfire left the region with a lot of ground without tree coverage, said Janice Quick, president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce who has lived in the mountain town for 45 years.",
      "\"All this rain is bringing down a lot of debris and a lot of mud from the mountain area,\" she said.",
      "Residents around the burn scar zones from the Airport Fire in Orange County were also ordered to evacuate Wednesday morning.",
      "Northern California flood watch",
      "The storm has already caused damage in Northern California, where flash flooding led to water rescues and\u00a0at least one death, authorities said.",
      "Much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area were under a flood watch and a high wind warning through Friday. Forecasters warned of heavy snow and said gusts were expected to create \"near white-out conditions\" Wednesday in parts of the Sierra Nevada and make it \"nearly impossible\" to travel through the mountain passes.",
      "The National Weather Service said a winter storm warning would be in effect for the Greater Tahoe Region until Friday morning.",
      "More than 125,000 people lost power as of Wednesday morning due to a damaged power pole, according to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.",
      "There's also a risk of severe thunderstorms and a small chance of tornadoes along the northern coast.",
      "Shasta County Sheriff Michael L. Johnson on Monday declared a state of emergency to prepare for more rain and allow the state to help with hazard mitigation and search and rescue operations.",

    "summary": "NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, tracks Santa's Christmas Eve flight around the world each year. Follow a live map of the tracker here.",
    "story": [
      "It's a Christmas Eve tradition that has delighted parents and children across the U.S. for 70 years now: tracking Santa Claus as he circles the globe, with the help of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD. Follow a live updating map below as NORAD once again\u00a0tracks Santa's journey from the North Pole to deliver gifts to children around the world.",
      "Where is Santa right now?",
      "NORAD updates its map in real time to show Santa's locations on his trip around the world. The journey begins from the North Pole, and NORAD uses its expertise in satellite technology to track the route of Santa's sleigh as it glides through the sky.",
      "In addition to the live map on\u00a0NORAD's website, updates are being posted on the agency's Facebook, X, Instagram\u00a0and YouTube pages.",
      "Santa's route began by taking him down the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean. He moved westward from there, with his first stops being in the South Pacific, New Zealand and Australia. He zigzagged through Asia, Africa and Europe before making his way across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada, the U.S., Mexico, and Central and South America.",
      "NORAD notes that his path can sometimes be unpredictable.",
      "When will Santa be at your house?",
      "The experts at NORAD say Santa typically makes his stops between 9 p.m. and midnight on Christmas Eve, but the tracker can't predict the specific time he'll stop at an individual home.",
      "\"Only Santa know his route, which means we cannot predict where and when he will arrive at your house,\" NORAD writes on its website. \"We do, however, know from history that it appears he arrives only when children are asleep!\"",
      "President and first lady answer calls for NORAD's Santa tracker",
      "President Trump and first lady Melania Trump, who are spending the holiday at Mar-a-Lago, participated in the holiday tradition by answering several calls from children who dialed the NORAD Santa tracker hotline.",
      "A 10-year-old named Jasper from Oklahoma asked the president how they track Santa.",
      "Mr. Trump responded, \"We track Santa all over the world. We want to make sure that Santa is being good. Santa is a very good person. We want to make sure that he's not infiltrated, that we're not infiltrated into our country a bad Santa. So we found out that Santa is good. Santa loves you. Santa loves Oklahoma, like I do. You know, Oklahoma was very good for me in the election, so I love Oklahoma. Don't ever leave Oklahoma, OK?\"",
      "Jasper's little sister then asked the president when Santa would be at her house. Mr. Trump said he'd get there tonight and leave a lot of \"beautiful presents.\"",
      "Mr. Trump asked another little girl what she wanted for Christmas, and the child said, \"Uh ... not coal.\"",
      "\"Not coal?\" Mr. Trump replied. \"No, you don't want coal. Well, coal is \u2014 you mean clean, beautiful coal,\" he laughed. \"I had to do that, I'm sorry.\u00a0 No, coal is clean and beautiful. Please remember that at all costs. But you don't want clean, beautiful, coal right?\"",
      "\"No,\" the girl said, listing a Barbie and some other presents she wanted instead.",
      "What is NORAD?",
      "NORAD, which is short for the North American Aerospace Defense Command, is a bi-national organization involving both the U.S. and Canada. It is headquartered at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, and its year-round mission is to defend North America \"through aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning.\"",
      "NORAD's technology includes the North Warning System, a powerful radar system with 49 installations across Alaska and northern Canada. NORAD also relies on satellites positioned 22,300 miles above the Earth with infrared sensors for detecting heat, and it has fighter jets at its disposal for patrolling and protecting its territory.",
      "\"Twenty-four-seven, 365 days a year, we're monitoring the skies of North America for any airborne threats,\" U.S. Air Force Col. Jason White\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "On Christmas Eve, that expertise is used for a more festive purpose.",
      "How does the Santa tracker work?",
      "Beginning early in the morning on Dec. 24, NORAD begins tracking Santa's path from the North Pole and maps his journey as he delivers presents to children around the world. The NORAD Tracks Santa Operations Center is staffed by uniformed personnel and civilian volunteers to answer phone calls and provide updates on Santa's location.",
      "You can call 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877 446-6723) to get a live update from one of the call center operators over the phone. Operators are available from 4 a.m. Mountain Time (6 a.m. Eastern) until midnight MT (2 a.m. ET).",
      "\"They logged 380,000 calls last Christmas Eve,\" White said.",
      "You can also check NORAD's website, where updates are available in nine languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Chinese and Korean.",
      "What else is there to know about the Santa tracker?",
      "This is the 70th year of the Santa tracking mission. It began in 1955 under NORAD's predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command, or CONAD, and when NORAD was formed three years later it continued the practice each Christmas Eve.",
      "The tradition got it start when a child accidentally called the CONAD Operations Center after seeing an advertisement in the newspaper that encouraged readers to call Santa.",
      "\"The individual that answered that phone didn't want to disappoint the child on the other end, and just went with it. And it has turned into an annual, recurring Track Santa operation ever since,\" White said.",
      "NORAD says the program is made possible by volunteers and supported by funding from corporate sponsors.",

    "story": [
      "The two people killed in the explosions\u00a0at a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, nursing home on Tuesday were a staff member and a resident, officials said.",
      "One of the victims was Muthoni Nduthu, 52, the Bucks County Coroner's Office said. The name of the other victim has not been released.",
      "Bristol Township Police provided more updates Wednesday about the fatal explosions at the Bristol Health and Rehab Center on Tower Road, which was previously known as the Silver Lake Nursing Home. Officials said a gas leak led to two explosions and a fire and that there was a smell of gas at the scene.",
      "State records show Nduthu was a licensed practical nurse.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, 19 people are still hospitalized, one of whom is in critical condition, Bristol Township Police Chief Charles Winik, Jr. said in a news conference. He could not provide more information on the nature of their injuries or say how many are residents or staff members.",
      "The violent explosions blew out windows and caused part of the building to collapse. That collapsed section contained the kitchen and cafeteria, with some utility areas and offices underneath, according to officials.",
      "Crews with heavy construction equipment are on the scene combing through the wreckage. Fire Chief Kevin Dippolito said investigators hoped to gain access to the collapsed portion of the building Wednesday afternoon. Once in place, investigators can work to determine the cause of the explosions, he added.",
      "\"Until we excavate that area and remove the walls and roofs that collapsed we won't have any idea what may have occurred in there,\" Dippolito said.",
      "The investigation could take weeks or months, officials said. PECO said in a statement that the National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation.",
      "The fire chief said he could not recall any prior calls to the property recently for gas-related issues.",
      "Winik said the law enforcement response to the explosion was the largest he has seen in 20 years.",
      "\"I've never seen such heroism,\" he said.",
      "Officials including Gov. Josh Shapiro and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick have also commended law enforcement, firefighters and staff from the nearby Lower Bucks Hospital for their help rescuing residents.",
      "Bristol Health and Rehab residents have been placed in other nursing homes and facilities owned by Saber Healthcare Group.",
      "Saber acquired the facility 24 days ago, the company said in a statement.",
      "\"We could not be prouder of those men and women who, in the face of tragedy, stepped up to support one another,\" the statement said in part. \"We have worked to improve and fix prior issues, and we will continue that work in the wake of this event. We thank those who have offered their thoughts and prayers for our staff and residents, and we will continue to work to ensure the safety of the community in the days and weeks to come.\"",
      "According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services, there were 75 deficiency reports against Silver Lake Health Care Center between July 2022 and March 2025. The center was fined a total of $418,000. This was during the time the facility was managed by CommuniCare Health Services.",

      "\"The windows were all blown out, insulation was falling from the sky,\" Hibbs said.",
      "Hibbs said he helped pull five people from the rubble, including four employees, some of whom had serious injuries.",
      "\"One lady's face swelled pretty bad. She had a gash on her head,\" he said. \"The one lady was complaining she thought her ankle was broken. The other one's knee, she thought was twisted. I just started handing people off to other people so I could go back and get the next one.\"",
      "As neighbors helped evacuate survivors, Hibbs said his wife distributed blankets and towels to keep people warm.",

    "summary": "The new tourist tax imposes an 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers to address climate change threats to Hawaii.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge's ruling clears the way for Hawaii to include cruise ship passengers in a new tourist tax to help pay for the impacts of climate change, a levy set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake on Tuesday denied a request seeking to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruises.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "\"Cruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawaii and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,\" association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement.",
      "According to court records, the plaintiffs will appeal. They asked the judge to grant an injunction pending an appeal and requested a ruling by Saturday afternoon, given that the law takes effect Jan. 1.",
      "Hawaii will continue to defend the law, which requires cruise operators to pay their share of transient accommodation tax to address climate change threats to the state, state Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. government intervened in the case, calling the tax a \"scheme to extort American citizens and businesses solely to benefit Hawaii\" in conflict with federal law.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economists-grade-us-economy-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:27:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy remained on track this year, defying the gloomiest predictions. That doesn't mean Americans are thrilled with how things are going.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy has been tested by a barrage of challenges in 2025, from sharply higher U.S. tariffs that drove up inflation and rattled consumer confidence, to rising unemployment amid a slowdown in hiring.",
      "Despite those headwinds, the economy has continued to chug along, defying early-year warnings from some economists that the nation could be headed for a recession or that the Trump administration's tariffs would reignite runaway inflation.",
      "The biggest surprise of the year has been the economy's durability, according to experts. Economic growth has surged\u00a0to its fastest pace in two years, inflation has risen less than feared and the stock market has climbed to\u00a0fresh highs.",
      "\"This has been another year of resilience for the economy,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"The economy has grown at a pretty steady pace.\"",
      "Yet Pearce hastens to add that the economy, although it has navigated some tricky waters, is \"not spectacular\" as the year comes to a close, assigning it a grade of a B or B-. Other experts who spoke with CBS News also graded the economy in the B range.",
      "That may strike many consumers as generous. Three-quarters of Americans surveyed by CBS News earlier this month said they would give the U.S. economy a C, D or F, while just 25% assigned it an A or a B. Recent consumer confidence surveys also indicate that many Americans are downbeat about the economy, mainly due to stubbornly high prices.",
      "The disconnect partly reflects the differences in how consumers and economists tend to judge the nation's economic performance. While financial pros tend to focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation and unemployment, consumers are more likely to assess the economy based on pocketbook issues like food prices and health care costs \u2014 both of which have risen in 2025.",
      "The White House said the economy has improved from last year under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Although much work remains, the American economy is leaps... better now than it was a year ago under Joe Biden: cooled inflation, private-sector job growth, cheaper essentials like gas, lower taxes, and trillions in investments flowing in to make and hire in America,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "He added, \"As President Trump's economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can rest assured that 2026 will be even better.\"",
      "A turbulent year",
      "The economy has been marked by pronounced volatility and uncertainty in 2025, ranging from the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs to an\u00a0alarming downturn in growth\u00a0in the first three months of the year.",
      "\"It's rare that we've seen a president come in and, with a unified Congress, have such immediate impacts on the economy,\" Pearce said. \"Not all of those are impacting the economy right away, but we've seen a lot of those policies generate a lot of uncertainty.\"",
      "For instance, the Republicans' \"big beautiful bill\" act, signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, will likely impact the economy in 2026, with consumers expected to receive juicier tax refunds.",
      "Other effects of the new law could work against some consumers. Perhaps most concerning is the expiration of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which experts warn will sharply drive up health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, it's been a banner year for investors as the boom in artificial intelligence pushed the stock market to a succession of record highs. At the same time, the bullish sentiment on Wall Street has fueled questions about whether a possible\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0could turn to bust if the enormous investment in the technology fails to deliver the promised gains in productivity and corporate profits.",
      "Life on the \"K\"",
      "Economic turmoil often impacts consumer sentiment, making people feel less confident about their finances, economists have long noted. That dynamic has led experts to describe the economy this year as \"K-shaped,\" in which higher-income consumers spend robustly \u2014 thanks in part to the\u00a0strong stock market\u00a0\u2014 even as lower- and middle-income consumers\u00a0pull back.",
      "And it's no wonder. Although inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, prices remain elevated, squeezing many Americans and making it hard for them to cover even basic expenses, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "It isn't just routine purchases that are straining consumers \u2014 it's also the barriers in the way today of reaching once ordinary financial goals, such as buying a first home, saving for retirement or even just paying off debt, added Chen Zhao, head of economic research at online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "When it comes to homeownership, evidence of that barrier is visible in the median age of first homebuyers today \u2014 that hit 40 this year, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. With home values near all-time highs and mortgage rates hovering around 6.3%, many younger Americans are feeling priced out, she said.",
      "\"This situation that we're in right now, where [housing] affordability has gotten to be the worst it's really ever been in recent memory \u2014 and significantly worse than before the pandemic \u2014 it's really unfortunate for the younger generation,\" Zhao said. \"It means delaying the American dream for a lot of folks.\"",
      "In 160 U.S. cities, at least one-fifth of middle-class residents can't afford to live in that area, after factoring in local income levels and price differences, according to Brookings, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Hiring slowdown",
      "Another pressure point is the labor market, where hiring has slowed throughout 2025. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, its highest level in four years.",
      "Layoffs also\u00a0jumped to 1.1 million this year through November, up 54% from a year earlier and the highest level since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "While job seekers are finding it tougher to get a foothold in today's labor market, it's proving particularly challenging for young people, who are facing a decline in job listings and competition from more experienced workers, experts said.",
      "Cooling job growth in the second half of the year is partially a reflection of persistent economic uncertainty, which has led many businesses to throttle hiring. Some businesses are also trimming jobs as they invest in AI, which can perform some tasks previously handled by employees.",
      "\"Any type of uncertainty is going to lead to slower business decisions, whether it's hiring or investment,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Labor market headwinds in 2025 have prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three straight times since September. By lowering borrowing costs, the Fed is aiming to encourage businesses to expand and hire.",
      "Slower hiring and rising layoffs could pose a risk to consumer spending, which drives nearly two-thirds of economic activity, economists note.",
      "\"A slower labor market leads to slower income growth, which eventually ends up pulling consumer spending lower,\" Daco said.",
      "Muted tariff impact",
      "One of the biggest economic surprises of 2025 came with President Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced in April on what he termed \"liberation day.\" The plan caused U.S. stocks to plunge\u00a0and stoked fears that the levies would reignite inflation.",
      "Yet despite such concerns, tariffs so far have had a more muted impact on inflation than initially feared. That's partly because U.S. companies, which pay the import duties to the federal government, stockpiled goods before the tariffs kicked in and absorbed some of the costs rather than passing them on to consumers.",
      "\"Generally speaking, the economy outperformed expectations in the face of several large supply shocks,\" Daco said.",
      "Still, inflation remains sticky. The Consumer Price Index, which stood at 3% in January, remains near the same level as of November. Oxford Economics' Pearce estimates that the stepped-up import duties added 0.5 percentage points to the nation's inflation rate this year.",

    "story": [
      "Rising energy costs are adding to the affordability issues facing millions of U.S. consumers, with nonprofit group PowerLines recently estimating that more than 100 million Americans could see heftier bills this year because of rate hikes.",
      "The average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association (NEADA). Those who use electricity for heating were projected to see an even steeper jump of 12.2%, with the average bill swelling from $1,090 to $1,233, the group found.",
      "\"Millions of households are being pushed deeper into utility debt and closer to shutoffs simply because they cannot afford to keep their homes warm,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement.",
      "So what recourse do Americans have, knowing comfort comes at a cost? Here are some tips on how to save money on your utility bill:",
      "Get a home energy audit. An inspector can help you detect where cold air might be seeping into your house and recommend energy efficiency improvements. Audits are performed by certified home energy auditors, according to energystar.gov. Look to local government agencies or your utility company for home energy assessment tips.",
      "Tackle obvious leaks. Justin Castronova, a lead inspector at First Choice Inspectors in Illinois, told CBS News consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi that the best place to start is with doors and windows. Castronova recommends using caulk to seal gaps, maintaining weather stripping for doors and windows, and using spray foam around electrical outlets (make sure to turn off your power first).",
      "Invest in energy-efficient appliances. That can save you from $10 to $50 a month, depending on the size of the appliance and how many you have, Castronova said.",
      "Insulate your home. This will ensure the envelope of your home is fortified against the cold weather. Energy Star, an energy-efficiency program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, has a handy DIY guide on how to get started.",
      "Look into state, federal and nonprofit assistance programs. For example, the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides financial assistance to low-income households to weather-proof their homes and even deal with energy-related home repairs. The best way to find out what you qualify for is to call 211, which connects people with health and human services resources.",

    "summary": "The police chief of Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, says the incident response after the nursing home explosion is the largest he's ever seen in 20 years.",
    "story": [
      "The emergency response to the Bristol, Pennsylvania, nursing home explosion was the largest the local police chief has ever seen in his career spanning nearly two decades, he told reporters Wednesday. He praised the first responders and described extraordinary acts of heroism after the blast, which killed one resident and one staff member on Tuesday.",
      "Agencies from across Bucks County and even Philadelphia flocked to the scene at the Bristol Health and Rehab Center,\u00a0previously known as the Silver Lake Nursing Home,\u00a0after two explosions there, accompanied by the smell of gas. Officials said the incident collapsed the cafeteria and kitchen area and spurred a massive effort to evacuate 120 residents from the facility.",
      "Bristol Township Police Chief Charles Winik said he saw fire crews run into the building that still smelled of natural gas in an effort to evacuate residents.",
      "\"I've never seen such heroism,\" Winik said. \"They were still going into the building to recover people that couldn't walk, they were in wheelchairs, some people couldn't talk. It just could've been a much more serious catastrophe.\"",
      "In remarks made at the scene Tuesday night, Gov. Josh Shapiro mentioned one first responder who carried two people on his back out of the building. Winik said that was a Bristol Township police narcotics sergeant, a 20-year veteran of the department.",
      "Winik credited the heroic work of everyone involved, not just law enforcement and firefighters. Staff from the nearby Lower Bucks Hospital, just across a parking lot, sprang into action too.",
      "\"It was blessing that we're next to a hospital. We had hospital staff come over and help us temporarily home [the nursing home residents]\u2026 It was a difficult task,\" he said.",
      "Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick commended everyone involved in rescue and response efforts.",
      "\"When the moment demanded courage, our community delivered it. Firefighters, police officers, medics, nurses, and emergency personnel from across our region answered the call without hesitation, and because of them, lives were saved,\" Fitzpatrick said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Incident response unprecedented, chief says",
      "The massive response was unlike anything the chief or his department had ever seen, he said.",
      "\"I've talked to several other officers and command staff that have been doing this longer than me, and they've never seen anything like it in this area,\" Winik added.",
      "While work is still underway to investigate the nursing home site, Bristol officials are grateful that no first responders were injured, and for a community that came together.",
      "\"Bristol Township is one of those types of communities where we all come together when we recognize that we have a problem,\" said Winik. \"We had employees from the building, as well, helping. We had nurses from the hospital, we had people from all over assisting. It was a tremendous effort from everybody in Bucks County.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge blocked President Trump's attempt to strip a security clearance from whistleblower attorney Mark Zaid Tuesday, finding that the Trump administration did so in \"retribution\" and without proper due process.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled Tuesday night that \"the government's retribution\" against Zaid was \"carried out by summarily canceling the attorney's security clearance without any of the process that is afforded to others.\" Ali said the administration had not conducted an individualized national security assessment of Zaid's clearance before stripping him of it.",
      "The judge also found that Zaid introduced credible evidence that he \"cannot properly advise current clients because he is precluded from accessing classified material and using classified information\" in their defense.",
      "Zaid sued the Trump administration in May after Mr. Trump rescinded his security clearance, as well as the clearances of prominent Democrats, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several members of the Biden administration. Mr. Trump's order said that it was \"no longer in the national interest\" for Zaid and the other individuals listed to access classified information.",
      "Zaid represented the whistleblower who reported concerns about the president's dealings with Ukraine during his first term, and in Mr. Trump's second term, he's also been retained by many whistleblowers. Zaid had held a security clearance for over two decades.",
      "Ali, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, granted Zaid's motion for a preliminary injunction to \"immediately and fully restore\" his security clearance and access to classified information. The judge put his order on hold for 21 days to allow the Justice Department to consider an appeal. If there is no appeal, the order is set to go into place on Jan. 13.",
      "Ali also rejected a Justice Department motion to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Zaid said the decision is \"an indictment of the Trump administration's attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",
      "\"I will not be intimidated and look forward to continuing to defend the brave men and women who stand up to the unlawful retaliation of the Trump administration,\" the statement continued.",

    "summary": "His lawyers argued that Rozier's alleged involvement\u200b in the wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies is limited.",
    "story": [
      "Terry Rozier's attorneys filed a motion in federal court asking a judge to throw out the charges in a gambling case that has sidelined him from playing point guard for the Miami Heat so far this season.",
      "Rozier pleaded not guilty earlier this month to charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Prosecutors allege the conspiracies happened between December 2022 and March 2024.",
      "Federal prosecutors accused Rozier of participating in a scheme which facilitated bets on NBA basketball games that allegedly took advantage of insider information related to injury reports.",
      "His lawyers argued in the filing made public on Tuesday that Rozier's alleged involvement in the wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies is limited.",
      "His attorneys argued that the government's claim that sportsbooks completed bets that otherwise might not have been honored is a theory of fraud that \"has repeatedly been rejected,\" and they argue that the federal wire fraud statute had been narrowed by a recent Supreme Court ruling.",
      "\"The only basis for any alleged misconduct is breaching the sportsbook rules themselves, rather than any cognizable theory of fraud,\" Rozier's lawyers, \u00a0A. Jeff Ifrah and James Trusty, wrote. The attorneys also argue in the motion that the indictment fails to allege an essential element of money laundering conspiracy: that Rozier agreed to commit the offense. Thus, they argue, both charges should be dropped.",
      "Federal prosecutors accused Rozier of participating in a scheme surrounding a\u00a0Charlotte Hornets\u00a0and\u00a0New Orleans Pelicans\u00a0game on March 23, 2023. Rozier, who played for the Hornets before being traded to the Miami Heat in early 2024, played only 9 minutes and 34 seconds, leaving the game with right foot discomfort.",
      "The indictment alleges that Rozier passed this information before the game to his close childhood friend and co-defendant Deniro Laster. His friend then allegedly placed wagers using that information and allegedly sold that information to others, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors said in a Dec. 16 letter to the judge, right after Rozier's attorneys filed their motion to dismiss but before it was made public, that Laster has lived with Rozier and has frequently traveled with him to attend Rozier's games. Between approximately December 2022 and May 2025, Laster was paid over $165,000 in regular payments from Rozier's company, GMB Chronicles LLC, the prosecutors' letter said.",
      "Rozier's attorneys said in their motion, \"Mr. Rozier's only role in the alleged scheme was to provide nonpublic information to Deniro Laster that enabled Laster to place wagers using that information.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York did not respond to a request for comment before publication.",
      "The letter filed by the government last week detailed a growing dispute between the government and Rozier over the intertwined relationship between the co-defendants. The letter notifies the court about a potential conflict, alleging that Rozier was paying for Laster's legal fees. Prosecutors also point to their concerns about Rozier's attorney making public comments on the case, such as saying Rozier relied on a \"bad friend,\" and was \"confiding in a friend,\" and \"that's not a crime.\"",
      "Rozier was\u00a0arrested\u00a0in Orlando on Oct. 23 during a sweeping FBI crackdown in which 34 defendants were snagged across two federal indictments.",
      "Rozier appeared in court in Brooklyn on Dec. 8 alongside Laster. He was released on a $3 million bond secured by his home in Florida and another property.",
      "Laster, who lives in Cleveland, was released on a $50,000 secured bond by his mother and cousin.",
      "Both defendants surrendered their passports, agreed to travel limitations, be tested for substances and not partake in gambling, among other bond conditions. They are due back in court on March 3 for a hearing before U.S. District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall.",

      "\"If Network NEWSCASTS, and their Late Night Shows, are almost 100% Negative to President Donald J. Trump, MAGA, and the Republican Party, shouldn't their very valuable Broadcast Licenses be terminated? I say, YES!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social in the wee hours of the morning.",
      "The post came minutes after the president criticized \"The Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert, calling him a \"pathetic trainwreck, with no talent or anything else necessary for show business success.\" The show is set to end in May 2026.",
      "\"Now, after being terminated by CBS, but left out to dry, he has actually gotten worse, along with his nonexistent ratings,\" Mr. Trump continued. \"Stephen is running on hatred and fumes ~ A dead man walking! CBS should, 'put him to sleep,' NOW, it is the humanitarian thing to do!\"",
      "The president also directed his ire at late-night hosts more broadly.",
      "\"Who has the worst Late Night host, CBS, ABC, or NBC???\" Mr. Trump said in another post. \"They all have three things in common: High Salaries, No Talent, REALLY LOW RATINGS!\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly voiced frustration with late-night hosts. The president floated revoking TV broadcast licenses for networks that cover him negatively earlier this year, saying in September that the decision to revoke their licenses should be up to Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sometimes wrecking balls and bulldozers move faster than the legal system.",
      "That's the dilemma facing the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which lost its bid to temporarily halt construction of the White House ballroom last week. A judge sided with President Trump, allowing work to continue on the East Wing site while imposing limited requirements on the administration.",
      "\"The American people own these places. And we, the American people, have a right to weigh in when significant changes to them are proposed,\" Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the Trust, said in an interview with CBS News. \"This project needs to follow the already legally mandated processes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has overhauled parts of the White House at a sprinter's pace and with virtually no oversight. The East Wing and the corridor connecting it to the main residence were dismantled in a matter of days in October.",
      "Mr. Trump's next architectural adventure is anyone's guess, but it appears there's little standing in his way.",
      "Quillen said she has \"deep concern\" about future projects. The Trust's lawsuit seeks a judicial declaration that would impose pre-demolition requirements on White House construction so that more pieces of the building are not disappeared before experts and the public have a chance to weigh in.",
      "The White House argues the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project is not yet far enough along to require approval from entities that typically have oversight of federal construction in Washington, D.C. Construction plans, government lawyers told the court, have not been finalized.",
      "As for future projects at the executive mansion, a White House official said, \"There are no plans for any demolition of any structures at this time.\"",
      "Quillen said there was a silver lining in Judge Richard Leon's ruling against the Trust.",
      "\"We view the judge's order as really helpful. And we learned a lot and it actually facilitates our aims in the suit,\" Quillen said.",
      "While ruling against the Trust, Leon ordered the government to file construction plans with the National Capital Planning Commission and Commission of Fine Arts by the end of the month \u2014 something the White House had already signaled it intended to do.",
      "The administration has argued that it has no obligation to file construction plans with the NCPC prior to demolition because the commission's authority, it says, only applies to vertical construction \u2014 not demolition.",
      "The government also produced a previously unpublished environmental assessment of the ballroom. That document provided some details about the project's scope, timeline and the steps taken to preserve and prepare White House grounds for the 90,000-square-foot addition. The National Park Service completed the assessment in August, but it was not released until last week in a court filing.",
      "The Trust is also asking the court to enforce a law that would require ballroom construction to obtain congressional approval. The law holds that, \"A building or structure shall not be erected on any reservation, park, or public grounds of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia without express authority of Congress.\"",
      "Congressional Republicans, who hold a majority in both houses, have yet to take a formal interest in the ballroom. The $400 million project is privately financed, and thus far no congressional appropriation or approval resolution is under consideration.",
      "The White House maintains the president has the unilateral authority to build on White House grounds.",
      "Quillen argues that because the White House has so far operated outside the process typically required for other federal construction in Washington, experts and the public have been excluded from providing pre-demolition input, and history could be lost.",
      "\"When projects like this go through these processes, the outcome ends up being better. The people have a voice. You build more support for the project. It becomes a more lasting legacy and improvements can be made to it along the way,\" Quillen said.",
      "The National Capital Planning Commission is slated to hear a presentation on the ballroom on Jan. 8. Another court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 15.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/19-states-d-c-sue-hhs-over-effort-to-ban-transgender-care-for-minors/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The declaration issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone's gender expression doesn't match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited. After taking office in January, President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to cut federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors' offices,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS's declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",
      "Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.",
      "The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers \u2014 and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules \u2014 one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.",
      "The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.",
      "Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Mr. Trump returned to office \u2014 even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first time the Supreme Court had waded into the issue of health care for transgender youth.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18.",
      "The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.",
      "Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania's Democratic governor also joined.",

      "The man accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., last month has been charged with five additional federal felonies, according to a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, is now facing charges of first-degree premeditated murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed, possession of a firearm during a crime of violence or dangerous offense, transporting or receiving firearms in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to commit an offense, and transporting or shipping a stolen firearm in interstate or foreign commerce.",
      "Lakanwal had previously been charged with\u00a0murder, assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence for the shooting in Washington, D.C., Superior Court. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and has a court appearance scheduled for Jan. 2.",
      "Lakanwal is accused of shooting\u00a0Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom\u00a0and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, both members of the West Virginia National Guard who had been deployed to the nation's capital, in an ambush-style attack on Nov. 26. Beckstrom, 20, was shot in the head and died from her wounds the next day.",
      "Wolfe, 24, was also shot in the head and critically wounded. As of earlier this month, he was able to breathe on his own and could stand with assistance. His medical team said on Dec. 12 that he was ready to transition from acute care to inpatient rehabilitation, noting in a statement that he had made \"extraordinary progress.\"",
      "Lakanwal was shot and wounded by another National Guard member during the attack and was taken into custody by the Secret Service, according to Tuesday's criminal complaint. He was hospitalized and initially placed on a ventilator. He made his first court appearance virtually from the hospital.",
      "According to the complaint, the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver used in the shooting was legally purchased in Washington state by somebody else, who had died in 2023. Lakanwal allegedly tried to buy several other guns, including an AR-15 and a \"Draco\" or \"compact, AK-47-style, stockless pistol,\" claiming he needed them for protection for his job as a rideshare driver. On Nov. 14, he was eventually able to buy the revolver used in the shooting, the complaint alleged, which had been stolen from the original owner's home several months after his death.",
      "The complaint notes that Washington state law stipulates all firearm sales, \"including private transfers\u2014must be conducted through a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), which requires the purchaser to complete ATF Form 4473 and to undergo a state background check.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges Lakanwal bought ammo for the revolver the next day and then searched for \"Washington, D.C.\" and \"The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500\" in Google Maps.",
      "Lakanwal entered the United States in 2021, multiple law enforcement sources previously told CBS News. He came to the U.S. under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome, according to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",

      "Thousands of people traveled from nearby towns and villages to attend Bethlehem's annual Christmas Eve tree lighting ceremony in the city's historic Manger Square. Historically an event filled with joy and wonder, it was the first such ceremony since the war in Gaza began in 2023. But hardly any tourists were in attendance.",
      "For more than two years, international tourists and Christian pilgrims have largely stayed away following Hamas' deadly terrorist attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. As the war in Gaza raged, church leaders canceled Bethlehem's public Christmas celebrations.",
      "But this year, for Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati, the\u00a0Trump administration-brokered ceasefire was reason enough to try to bring the faithful back to where the Christmas story began.",
      "\"Bethlehem, you know, we are living from tourists, from tourism and from pilgrims who come to stay in our hotels, to eat in our restaurants, to buy our souvenirs that we're producing here,\" Canawati said. \"And there was a complete halt on tourism for the past two years.\"",
      "Inside the 4th-century Church of the Nativity, one of the world's oldest and most sacred Christian sites, around 15,000 visitors would arrive every day in times of peace. The absence of tourists has devastated Bethlehem's tourism industry, and nearly its entire economy, driving unemployment up to 70%. Hotel vacancies have been at record highs.",
      "Muhammad Abu Jurah's family has run a souvenir shop in Bethlehem for generations. But over the last two years, he's been forced to lay off all six of his staff members.",
      "\"We don't have a lot of tourists because, you know, the war,\" he said. \"So, this is why they have a big problem in Bethlehem without tourists.\"",

    "story": [
      "Trump-backed candidate Nasry Asfura won Honduras' presidential election, the country's electoral authorities said Wednesday afternoon, ending a weeks-long count.",
      "The election result has continued a swing to the right in parts of Latin America, just a week after Chile chose the far-right politician Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast as its next president.",
      "Asfura, of the conservative National Party, received 40.27% of the vote in the Nov. 30, edging out four-time candidate Salvador Nasralla of the conservative Liberal Party, who finished with 39.39% of the vote.",
      "Asfura won in his second bid for the presidency, after he and Nasralla were neck-and-neck during a long vote count that fueled international concern over the Central American nation's fragile electoral system.",
      "On Tuesday night, a number of electoral officials and candidates were already fighting and contesting the results of the election. Meanwhile, followers in Asfura's campaign headquarters erupted into cheers.",
      "\"Honduras: I am prepared to govern,\" wrote Asfura, the former mayor of Honduras' capital Tegucigalpa, in a post on X shortly after the results were released. \"I will not let you down.\"",
      "The results were a rebuke of the current leftist leader and her governing democratic socialist Liberty and Re-foundation Party, known as LIBRE, whose candidate finished in a distant third place with 19.19% of the vote.",
      "Asfura ran as a pragmatic politician, pointing to his popular infrastructure projects in the capital. President Trump endorsed the 67-year-old conservative just days before the vote, saying he was the only Honduran candidate the U.S. administration would work with.",
      "\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Late last month, Mr. Trump also\u00a0pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez \u2014 a National Party member \u2014 on drug trafficking and weapons charges, allowing him to leave a U.S. federal prison. The U.S. president claimed Hernandez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly,\" but his decision drew criticism from some members of both parties.",
      "Nasralla has alleged that the election was fraudulent and called for a recount of all the votes just hours before the official results were announced.",
      "On Tuesday night, he addressed Mr. Trump in a post on X, writing: \"Mr. President, your endorsed candidate in Honduras is complicit in silencing the votes of our citizens. If he is truly worthy of your backing, if his hands are clean, if he has nothing to fear, then why doesn't he allow for every vote to be counted?\"",
      "He and others opponents of Asfura have maintained that Mr. Trump's last-minute endorsement was an act of electoral interference that ultimately swung the results of the vote.",
      "The unexpectedly tumultuous election was also marred by a sluggish vote count, which fueled even more accusations.",
      "The Central American nation was stuck in limbo for more than three weeks as vote-counting by electoral authorities lagged, and at one point was paralyzed after a special count of final vote tallies was called, fueling warnings by international leaders.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Organization of American States Secretary General Albert Rambin on Monday made an \"urgent call\" to Honduran authorities to wrap up a special count of the final votes before a deadline of Dec. 30. The Trump administration warned that any attempts to obstruct or delay the electoral count would be met with \"consequences.\"",
      "For the incumbent, progressive President Xiomara Castro, the election marked a political reckoning. She was elected in 2021 on a promise to reduce violence and root out corruption.",
      "She was among a group of progressive leaders in Latin American who were elected on a hopeful message of change around five years ago, but are now being cast out after failing to deliver on their vision. Castro said last week that she would accept the results of the elections even after she claimed that Mr. Trump's actions in the election amounted to an \"electoral coup.\"",
      "But Eric Olson, an independent international observer during the Honduran election with the Seattle International Foundation, and other observers said that the rejection of Castro and her party was so definitive that they had little room to contest the results.",
      "\"Very few people, even within LIBRE, believe they won the election. What they will say is there's been fraud, that there has been intervention by Donald Trump, that we we should tear up the elections and vote again,\" Olson said. \"But they're not saying 'we won the elections.' It's pretty clear they did not.\"",

      "The 20-point plan, agreed on by U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators, was being reviewed by Moscow, but the Kremlin has thus far refused to abandon its hardline territorial demands for full Ukrainian withdrawal from the east.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday Moscow was \"formulating its position\" and declined to comment on the specifics of the latest plan. He said Moscow believes it's \"highly inappropriate to conduct any kind of communication via the media.\"",
      "Zelenskyy briefed journalists on each point of the plan on Tuesday but reporters didn't have permission to reveal information about it until Wednesday morning.",
      "Zelenskyy conceded there are some points in the document he doesn't like, but said Kyiv has succeeded in removing immediate requirements for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk region in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland or that land seized by Moscow's army would be recognized as Russian.",
      "Nevertheless, the Ukrainian leader indicated the proposal would pave the way for Kyiv to pull some troops back, including from the 20 percent of the Donetsk region that it controls, where demilitarized zones would be established.",
      "It also got rid of demands that Kyiv must legally renounce its bid for NATO membership.",
      "Zelenskyy presented the plan during a two-hour briefing with journalists, reading from a highlighted and annotated version.",
      "\"In the Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions, the line of troop deployment as of the date of this agreement is de facto recognized as the line of contact,\" Zelenskyy said of the latest version.",
      "\"A working group will convene to determine the redeployment of forces necessary to end the conflict, as well as to define the parameters of potential future special economic zones,\" he added.",
      "This appears to suggest the plan opens the way for, but delays, options that Ukraine was previously reluctant to consider -- a withdrawal of troops and the creation of demilitarized zones.",
      "\"We are in a situation where the Russians want us to withdraw from the Donetsk region, while the Americans are trying to find a way,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "\"They are looking for a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone, meaning a format that could satisfy both sides,\" he continued.",

      "Tens of thousands have been killed, eastern Ukraine decimated and millions forced to flee their homes.",

      "Nevertheless, the prospects of Ukraine being admitted to the bloc appear to be slim-to-none, as it has been ruled out by Washington.",
      "Moscow has repeatedly said NATO membership for Ukraine is unacceptable, presenting it as one of the reasons it invaded in the first place.",
      "The plan sees joint U.S.-Ukrainian-Russian management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, which is occupied by Russian troops. Zelenskyy said he doesn't want any Russian oversight of the facility.",

      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker, called the Bella 1, over the weekend, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official said.",
      "But the ship \u2014 which had not yet entered Venezuelan waters \u2014 refused to be boarded and sailed away, fleeing toward the Caribbean. An active pursuit began, with the vessel sending distress signals to nearby ships. That pursuit remained underway as of Monday afternoon, according to the official.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Sunday the pursuit involved \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion.\"",
      "\"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said.",
      "The Coast Guard's pursuit of the tanker was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters did not give a specific location for the operation or the name of the vessel being pursued.",
      "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S.\u00a0this month.",
      "In a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries. A U.S. official told CBS News that the interdiction of the vessel followed a similar playbook to an earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
      "And earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0called The Skipper that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the tanker seized on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",
      "\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" he added. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"",
      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland.",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Monday he was \"deeply angered\" by the move and warned Washington to respect Denmark's sovereignty.",

      "The Danish foreign minister told television TV2 the Landry appointment and statements by Mr. Trump and Landry were \"totally unacceptable\" and said his ministry would call in the U.S. ambassador in coming days \"to get an explanation.\"",
      "\"As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty,\" he said.",

      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 A man accused of killing 15 people at Sydney's Bondi Beach obtained firearms training in New South Wales state outside Sydney with his father, according to Australian police documents released on Monday.",
      "The documents, made public following Naveed Akram's video court appearance from a Sydney hospital where he has been treated for an abdominal injury, said the two men recorded footage justifying the meticulously planned attack.",
      "Officers wounded Akram at the scene of the Dec. 14 shooting and killed his father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram.",
      "The state government confirmed Naveed Akram was transferred Monday from a hospital to a prison. Authorities identified neither facility.",
      "The 24-year-old and his father began their attack by throwing four improvised explosive devices toward a crowd celebrating an annual Jewish event at Bondi Beach, but the devices failed to explode, the documents said.",
      "Police described the devices as three aluminum pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb containing an explosive, gunpowder and steel ball bearings. None detonated, but police described them as \"viable\" IEDs.",
      "The pair had rented a room in the Sydney suburb of Campsie for three weeks before they left at 2:16 a.m. on the day of the attack. CCTV recorded them carrying what police allege were two shotguns, a rifle, five IEDs and two homemade ISIS flags wrapped in blankets.",
      "Police also released images of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge, providing them with an elevated vantage point and the protection of waist-high concrete walls.",
      "The largest IED was found after the gun battle near the footbridge in the trunk of the son's car, which had been left draped with the flags.",
      "Authorities had been looking into a month-long trip by the father and son to the Philippines, where there's been a decades-long Islamist insurgency in the south of the country.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said last week that the\u00a0attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City told CBS News the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Authorities have charged Akram with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to the wounded survivors and one count of committing a terrorist act.",
      "The antisemitic attack at the start of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration was Australia's worst mass shooting since a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "The New South Wales government introduced draft laws to Parliament on Monday that Premier Chris Minns said would become the toughest in Australia.",
      "The new restrictions would include making Australian citizenship a condition of qualifying for a firearms license. That would have excluded Sajid Akram, who was an Indian citizen with a permanent resident visa.",
      "Sajid Akram also legally owned six rifles and shotguns. A new legal limit for recreational shooters would be a maximum of four guns.",
      "Police said a video found on Naveed Akram's phone shows him with his father expressing \"their political and religious views and appear to summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack.\"",
      "The men are seen in the video \"condemning the acts of Zionists\" while they also \"adhere to a religiously motivated ideology linked to (ISIS),\" police said.",
      "Video shot in October shows them \"firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner\" on grassland surrounded by trees, police said.",

      "Thousands of mourners gathered under tight police security at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Sunday evening to mark a week since two gunmen targeting a Jewish festival killed 15 people. Since then, Australian governments have been galvanized into action on countering antisemitism and tightening already strict national gun controls.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, his predecessors John Howard and Scott Morrison, and Governor-General Sam Mostyn, who represents Australia's head of state King Charles III, were among the dignitaries at the commemoration that drew more than 10,000 people.",
      "\"This has to be the nadir of antisemitism in our country,\" New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies President David Ossip told the crowd. \"This has to be the moment when light starts to eclipse the darkness.\"",
      "The crowd booed Albanese when Ossip acknowledged his presence. Opposition leader Sussan Ley, who had said that a conservative government led by her would reverse a decision made by Albanese's center-left Labor Party government this year to recognize a Palestinian state, was cheered.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at Albanese over the attack on the Hannukah celebration, saying \"your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire.\" Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to link widespread calls for a Palestinian state, and criticism of Israel's military offensive in Gaza following Hamas' 2023 attack, to growing incidents of antisemitism worldwide.",

      "Images of the victims, aged 10 to 87, were projected at the commemoration. \"Waltzing Matilda\" was sung in honor of the youngest victim, whose Ukrainian parents gave their Australian-born daughter what they described as the most Australian name they knew.",
      "A widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, Ahmed al Ahmed, sent a message of support from his hospital bed. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the Syrian-born immigrant was\u00a0seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker. On Tuesday, Albanese said \"Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",

      "Beyond the famous beach, people around Australia united with Sydney's stricken Jewish community by lighting candles and observing one minute of silence at their homes at 6:47 p.m. to remember the moment the massacre unfolded. Television and radio networks across Australia also fell silent.",
      "The federal and New South Wales state governments declared Sunday a national Day of Reflection to mark Australia's worst mass shooting since 35 died in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "Albanese had earlier announced a review of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies following last week's attack, which was inspired by the Islamic State group.",

      "One of the suspects, Naveed Akram, 24, was shot by police. He has been charged with 15 counts of murder and 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to those wounded. His father, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene.",
      "The Health Department said 13 of those wounded at Bondi remained in Sydney hospitals on Sunday.",
      "Police bolstered security around Bondi on Sunday, including officers armed with rifles. There was criticism that the first police responders last week were armed only with Glock pistols, which did not have the lethal range of the assailants' shotguns and rifles. Two police officers were critically wounded.",
      "Flags flew at half-staff on the Sydney Harbor Bridge and government buildings, which were lit in yellow on Sunday night in a show of solidarity with the Jewish community.",
      "Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief Alex Ryvchin said the victims' families felt \"tragically, unforgivably let down\" by government failures to combat a growth in antisemitism in Australia since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023.",
      "A day after the attack, an emergency meeting of federal and state leaders committed to tightening national gun laws with measures including limiting the number of guns an individual can own. Sajid Akram legally owned six guns, including the two shotguns and two bolt-action rifles used at Bondi.",

When pressed for a reason, Schiff told Carson, Lewis \"got hysterical [and] verbally abusive\" when Schiff told him he couldn't fulfill his request in time.",

      "Things soured between the two of them in October 1982, the final time Allen guest hosted. Malkoff writes that one of the reasons Allen was banned was because he mocked a previous injury suffered by Carson. In addition, word got back to Carson that Allen was rude to crew members for making changes his associates requested.",
      "Infuriated at the changes his own people had requested, Steve phoned the crew member the next day, yelling at them. Word got back to Johnny. The crew member asked never to work with Allen again. Johnny assured him that he wouldn\u2019t have to, because Allen had been banned.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 06:00:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Legal expert breaks down Nick Reiner&apos;s challenging road ahead in the murder case, from competency evaluations to potential death penalty decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Murphy told Fox News Digital that the case against Nick Reiner is still in the discovery phase.",
      "Attorney Matt Murphy\u00a0is sharing insight into what the road ahead looks like for Nick Reiner after he was taken into custody for allegedly murdering his parents, beloved Hollywood actor and director Rob Reiner, and his wife, Michele Reiner.",
      "When speaking with Fox News Digital, Murphy explained that discovery is still ongoing in this case, saying Nick's lawyer, Alan Jackson, \"needs to carefully review as much discoveries as he can get,\" so that he can \"confidently decide\" if his client should \"just plead not guilty\" or to submit a \"guilty by reason of insanity plea.\"",
      "\"So continuing an arraignment, there's nothing unusual about that. And it's also important to remember that Nick Reiner not being transported \u2013 there's no verdict on that. There's no mental health professional that is making that call. The defense has the unilateral ability to, like I said, declare a doubt. And they can say, 'My client isn't ready to do this yet,' and at this stage, the court basically has to take them at their word.\"",
      "Murphy says Jackson now has to \"get his clients stabilized [and] communicative,\" adding that the next step in the process is to \"hurry up and wait.\" He added that he \"wouldn't be surprised to see this arraignment continued\" a few times, until Jackson \"decides whether or not he's going to enter a plea.\"",
      "Murphy says the case is still in the discovery phase. (Laura Cavanaugh/FilmMagic)",
      "ROB REINER AND WIFE MURDERED: TIMELINE SHOWS ARGUMENT WITH SON NIGHT BEFORE DEATHS",
      "He explained that the defense will likely ask the court for time to evaluate everything, and knowing that this case has the potential for the death penalty, Murphy emphasized that he wouldn't \"want the public's desire for an outcome ever to influence the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant\" and therefore would support that.",
      "\"The defense will then prepare what's known as a live-z packet, or in Los Angeles County, they call it a live z hearing. He's gonna accumulate as much information as he can regarding factors in mitigation,\" he explained. \"In the death penalty analysis, it's about factors in aggravation versus factors in mitigation. And some big factors in mitigation Alan Jackson's gonna argue are, the history of substance abuse, the family dynamics, the fact that these weren't strangers, these were his parents that knew him, et cetera, et cetera et cetera.\"",

      "\"Nathan Hockman will then make a decision regarding whether they're gonna seek the death penalty or whether they are simply gonna seek life without possibility of parole,\" Murphy said. \"And again, my prediction is they're going to seek LWOP. They're gonna to seek life without possibility parole. But I could be surprised. I've been wrong before.\"",
      "Murphy predicts Nick will receive a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. (\u00a0Rommel Demano/Getty Images)",
      "After Nick was detained under suspicion of murdering his parents, his history with addiction and mental health struggles have resurfaced.",
      "Murphy predicts Jackson will come in with \"some sort of mental health defense based on the addiction,\" and his struggles with mental health issues, but said there is a difference as far as \"organic mental illness\" goes. Organic mental illness encompasses illnesses such as \"schizophrenia that develops, that is no fault of the defendant.\"",
      "NICK REINER WILL BE CHARGED IN ROB REINER, MICHELE REINER'S DEATHS",
      "\"In other words, they get sick, they get mentally ill, and then they try to self-medicate, or they get into drugs as a result of that,\" Murphy said. \"I haven't heard any of that yet on Nick Reiner.\"",
      "He went on to compare Nick's case to another he worked in Orange County, California, which involved a young man with documented organic mental illness, who murdered his parents and was deemed legally sane and found guilty.",
      "Murphy compared Nick's case to a similar case he worked in Orange County. (Mona Edwards)",
      "\"California uses what's known as The McNaughton Rule,\" Murphy said. \"The McNaughton Rule is about 150 years old, and it basically stands for the proposition that if the criminal defendant understands the nature and quality of their acts, the nature and the quality of the acts at the time they commit the murder, then they are legally responsible even if they're high, even if their drunk, even they're suffering from mental illness.\"",

      "\"So the way we would explain it to our juries is if the devil pops up on the guy's shoulder and says 'hey go over there and stab that banana,' the person does not understand that they're killing a human being,\" he continued. \"In other words, they don't understand the nature and quality of their acts. However, if it's the devil pops up on your shoulder and says, go kill those people or I'm going to turn you into a frog, you still under the law have a moral and legal responsibility to tell the devil no.\"",
      "WATCH: ATTORNEY MATT MURPHY SAYS IT WOULDN'T SHOCK HIM TO SEE \u2018A BATTLE OF THE EXPERTS\u2019 DURING THE NICK REINER TRIAL",
      "Due to these factors, Murphy said that \"as good as Alan Jackson is, he's up against a tough one,\" adding that being intoxicated is not a \"true defense to murder,\" because if it was, \"nobody would ever be held accountable for murder.\"",
      "In terms of the actual trial, Murphy says that it's possible that the defense will \"declare a doubt regarding the mental competency\" of their client, after which \"the court will appoint two experts to do an evaluation,\" and then \"you wind up with this very long procedural process.\"",

      "Murphy predicts the defense will \"declare a doubt\" about Nick's mental competency. (Michael Buckner/Getty Images for Teen Vogue)",
      "\"Doctors will evaluate Nick Reiner and render their opinions,\" he said. \"And then if he's found to be incompetent, then he goes to a mental health facility. It's locked down for treatment and medication so that he will come back. And sometimes you see, it's almost like a game, a ping pong, where the mental health professionals will certify somebody for competency, send them back to court, and then the defense lawyer will declare a doubt again.\"",
      "Murphy made it clear that the investigation doesn't stop when charges are filed and that both the defense and the prosecution will conduct \"a very dedicated [and a] very professional investigation.\"",
      "WATCH: ATTORNEY MATT MURPHY PREDICTS NICK REINER'S TRIAL \u2018IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG PROCESS\u2019",
      "A video of Nick walking into a gas station and buying a drink following the murder has since surfaced online, and he allegedly was \"acting bizarrely\" prior to the murders while at Conan O'Brien's holiday party, two things Murphy says \"can cut both ways.\"",
      "\"With a very skilled trial lawyer like Alan Jackson, he's going to argue, 'Look, that means he doesn't know that he did anything wrong,'\" Murphy explained. \"And what the prosecution is going to say is. 'Look, that guy, clearly, he's not howling at the moon. He knows how to use a credit card. He knows that he's dealing with a person behind the register.' And truly, under the law, it's a very, very strict standard under the McNaughton rule.\"",

      "Murphy ended by acknowledging that \"addiction hits almost every family in America,\" and that so many people know someone like Nick, adding about Nick that \"I think it's very clear that he was loved by his parents.\"",
      "\"The number we keep seeing is 17 stints in rehab. I mean, that's two parents that really love their son,\" Murphy said. \"Even to the point that he's 32 years old and they're bringing him to Conan O'Brien's party. So he had a lot of advantages in life, and he's previously described himself as being a spoiled rich kid. So we'll see where this goes. This is gonna be a very, very interesting case to watch.\"",

      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",

      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "\"But when the gate gets weak, it relaxes or stays slightly open, and acid slips back up the wrong way,\" he said. This \"gate\" can weaken with magnesium deficiency, high stress, alcohol, poor sleep, dehydration and late-night snacking, all of which can disrupt healthy digestion.",
      "When acid hits the esophagus, it irritates tissue that was never designed to withstand it, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Every time acid comes back up the wrong way, it injures the lining like a slow chemical burn,\" said Gioffre, who is also the author of \"Get Off Your Acid\" and \"Get Off Your Sugar.\" Over time, that irritation erodes the lining, drives inflammation and can change the cells.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",

      "Once the cells start changing, the risk of further mutation goes up. If that process continues, Gioffre warned, it can progress to dysplasia, which is the stage right before esophageal cancer.",
      "Some studies have shown that among those with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, between 3% and 13% will go on to develop cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"So the real danger is not the heartburn you feel,\" he summarized. \"It is the repeated acid exposure forcing the esophagus to adapt in ways it was never designed to. Fixing reflux at the root stops this entire cascade before those cellular changes begin.\"",
      "Men at higher risk",
      "Men generally have a higher risk because they burn through magnesium faster, tend to carry more visceral fat pushing upward on the stomach, eat heavier meals and snack late at night, Gioffre cautioned. These activities all weaken the acid gate and shut down healthy digestion.",
      "THE BREAD THAT KEEPS THINGS MOVING IN THE BATHROOM \u2014 AND DOCTORS SAY IT REALLY WORKS",
      "\"Eating within three hours of lying down almost guarantees the stomach does not empty, and that is one of the biggest drivers of nighttime reflux,\" he said. \"On top of that, men often ignore symptoms, or mask them with PPIs and antacids instead of fixing the root cause.\"",

      "\"Another major warning sign is when reflux goes from something you notice occasionally to something you feel every day or every night, or when PPIs and antacids stop helping,\" Gioffre said. \"That usually means the lining is irritated and eroded, and may already be changing on a cellular level.\"",

Now, researchers say a surprising clue may help explain it, a domesticated sheep that lived more than 4,000 years ago.",

    "summary": "From a diaper bank in South Carolina to a community clinic in Florida and a village in India, pregnant women are getting a healthier start thanks to free prenatal multivitamins from Vitamin Angels and its partners. Their stories reveal how targeted nutrition support can help moms carry to term and give babies a stronger beginning.",
    "story": [
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "When Stephanie got pregnant with her first child at age 32, she channeled her limited energy and finances towards things like preparing space in her home and gathering supplies. The task, and cost, of securing and taking prenatal vitamins fell by the wayside.",
      "As an unemployed mom in Columbia, South Carolina, she\u2019s not alone. The state is home to a high number of women of reproductive age who lack health insurance \u2014\u00a0one in eight to be exact \u2014 and even more who don\u2019t have access to proper prenatal care. The effects can be dire, contributing to birth defects, preterm birth, and even infant and maternal death.",
      "But when Stephanie conceived her second child years later at age 41, she had a leg up: Through a local diaper bank called Power in Changing, she received not just diapers, information, support, and other supplies, but also free prenatal vitamins from the global health nonprofit\u00a0Vitamin Angels. Had the supplements not been free, Stephanie said, she likely would have prioritized something else and skipped them once again. That, fortunately, wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\"With this pregnancy, I took the prenatal and I felt good throughout the whole pregnancy with him\u2026I just overall generally feel healthier,\" Stephanie said. Despite being significantly older, she recovered faster from childbirth too. Stephanie\u2019s second child, she added, \"definitely benefited from having a healthy mom and a healthy start. He\u2019s brought a lot of joy to my life.\"",
      "Prenatal vitamins like those provided by Vitamin Angels are more than nice to have:\u00a0Research shows that pregnant women with inadequate nutrition are more likely to experience complications including post-partum hemorrhage and preterm delivery, and their babies are at higher risk of poor cognitive and physical development.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "\"During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body works overtime to nourish her baby,\" said\u00a0Colleen\u00a0Delaney, PhD, RDN, a researcher and registered dietitian nutritionist who serves as a technical advisor for Vitamin Angels. Simply eating more doesn\u2019t cut it. Moms with so-called \"hidden hunger\" may not lack calories, \"but they are short on the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support their health and their baby\u2019s development,\" Delaney added. \"Prenatal multivitamins are a simple, proven way to meet that need.\"",
      "But social and economic barriers like unemployment and unstable housing can prevent moms-to-be like Stephanie from taking the vitamins regularly. In fact, more than 1 million underserved pregnant women in the US miss out on important prenatal services, including multivitamins and nutrition support.",
      "That\u2019s where Vitamin Angels comes in. Thanks to donations from individuals and corporate partners like the brain supplement brand\u00a0Prevagen (which acts as a philanthropic collaborator and not a prenatal vitamin maker), pregnant women across the country can receive the supplements free of charge. And importantly, the women access them from local providers they already use and trust.",
      "\"Partners like Power in Changing know their community, they know the mothers they serve by name, and they know the support their clients need,\"\u00a0Ana C\u00e9spedes, Vitamin Angels CEO, said. \"We further support their work by giving them more tools \u2014 a proven prenatal multivitamin and nutrition education \u2014 to put into women\u2019s hands when they need it most.\"",
      "From South Carolina to East India",
      "A few states away from Stephanie, a Florida woman named Ty\u2019hara had trouble finding prenatal care options that accepted her Medicaid coverage. But when she discovered Bond Community Health Center, which provides a wide range of health services, she was able to access and take prenatal vitamins from Vitamin Angels diligently.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "While everyone\u2019s experiences and needs are different, and prenatals should be taken as a part of a healthcare provider\u2019s recommended prenatal care plan, Ty\u2019hara valued the healthy foundation they delivered during her pregnancy. The vitamins help the baby\u2019s organs \"function and form correctly,\" she said, \"as well as\u2026helping me with my iron and minerals and all the things that I need to support successful growth for her.\"",
      "Across the globe in India, a mom-to-be named Santoshini took Vitamin Angels supplements to round out her healthy routine. Like many of her neighbors, she got the vitamins free of charge from a program partner that collaborates with the Indian government to offer health education, childcare, immunizations, and more. \"I feel like these supplements help me get through the day without feeling tired,\" Santoshini said. That\u2019s important because, while she was pregnant, she also cared for her active\u00a0two-year-old son.",
      "Indeed, Vitamin Angels\u2019 impact goes far beyond underserved communities in the US to reach more than 74 million women and children annually in 65 countries worldwide. In low-resource areas, problems from insufficient nutrition from pregnancy until a child\u2019s fifth birthday can include additional and irreversible complications like blindness.",
      "But both at home and away, it doesn\u2019t take much to make a big difference. Case in point: A single dollar donation can impact four children;\u00a0$5 dollars reaches 20.",
      "\"Supporting moms during pregnancy is one of the smartest investments you can make,\"\u00a0Scott Minger, Vitamin Angels Chief Development Officer, said. \"For the cost of a few cups of coffee, we can provide a woman with a full course of prenatal multivitamins that help her stay healthy, carry to term, and welcome a stronger, healthier baby.\"",
      "Prevagen\u2019s leadership agrees the investment is well worth it, said Tom Dvorak, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Quincy Bioscience. \"At Prevagen, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life,\" he said. \"Our partnership with Vitamin Angels allows us to transform that belief into meaningful action by supporting mothers and children with the essential nutrition they need to thrive.\"",

      "Alito said the high court\u2019s majority made \"unwise\" and \"imprudent\" determinations to reach its decision. The majority also did not give enough deference to Trump after the president found that agitators were hindering immigration officers and other federal personnel from doing their jobs in Chicago and that the National Guard needed to step in to help.",

      "Illinois sued, and the lower courts blocked the National Guard\u2019s deployment, finding that Trump had not satisfied criteria in the law that said the president could only use the reserved forces when he was \"unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\" The Supreme Court\u2019s decision upheld that finding while the case proceeds through the courts.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority said in an unsigned order that \"regular forces\" meant the U.S. military, not ICE or other civilian law enforcement officers.

      "The majority also took issue with the statute's language about executing laws, saying that if the National Guard soldiers were simply protecting federal officers, that would not amount to executing laws.",
      "And, if the National Guard were executing laws, that could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which says the military cannot generally act as a domestic police force unless Congress authorizes it to, the majority said.",
      "Alito, an appointee of President George W. Bush, said he found it \"puzzling\" that the majority thought the Posse Comitatus Act was so relevant, saying the president could use the military for a \"range of domestic purposes.\" The Constitution allows the president to use the military to respond to war, insurrection or \"other serious emergency,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The conservative justice also warned of broader implications of the majority's decision, as Trump has attempted to deploy the National Guard in other cities as part of a crackdown on immigration enforcement and street crime. The president has also been met with legal pushback in California and Portland, Oregon, but the Chicago case was the furthest along in the court system.",

      "Requiring Trump to exhaust the use of other military forces before using the National Guard would lead to \"outlandish results,\" Alito said.",
      "\"Under the Court\u2019s interpretation, National Guard members could arrest and process aliens who are subject to deportation, but they would lack statutory authorization to perform purely protective functions,\" Alito wrote. \"Our country has traditionally been wary of using soldiers as domestic police, but it has been comfortable with their use for purely protective purposes.\"",

      "In fact, it was not until 1927 that President Calvin Coolidge wrote what would become the first \"official\" Christmas card to the American people. Coolidge, in response to multiple requests for a holiday greeting, penned a short, simple message, \"Season's Greetings,\" by hand in the distinctive, elegant form of cursive he was known for.",

Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon each sought to make it a more formal tradition, with Eisenhower adding Cabinet secretaries, members of Congress, and U.S. ambassadors overseas to the list of recipients.",

      "Blocking the deployment of National Guard troops, Sauer argued, risks \"jeopardizing the lives and safety of DHS officers,\" and prevents officials from taking what he argued are \"reasonable and lawful measures\" to protect federal agents from the \"violent resistance\" that they argue has persisted in Chicago.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new Android banking trojan called Sturnus is shaping up to be one of the most capable threats we have seen in a while. It is still in early development, but it already behaves like a fully mature operation.",
      "Once it infects a device, it can take over your screen, steal your banking credentials and even read encrypted chats from apps you trust. The worrying part is how quietly it works in the background. You think your messages are safe because they are end-to-end encrypted, but this malware simply waits for the phone to decrypt them before grabbing everything.",
      "It's important to note, however, that Sturnus does not break encryption; it only captures messages after your apps decrypt them on your device.",

      "Sturnus malware uses deceptive screens that mimic real banking apps to steal your credentials in seconds. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "A closer look at the malware's capabilities",
      "Sturnus combines several attack layers that give the operator nearly full visibility into the device, as reported by cybersecurity research firm ThreatFabric. It uses HTML overlays that mimic real banking apps to trick you into typing your credentials. Everything you enter goes straight to the attacker through a WebView that forwards the data instantly. It also runs an aggressive keylogging system through the Android Accessibility Service. This lets it capture text as you type, follow which app is open, and map every UI element on the screen. Even when apps block screenshots, the malware keeps tracking the UI tree in real time, which is enough to reconstruct what you are doing.",
      "NEW ANDROID MALWARE CAN EMPTY YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN SECONDS",
      "On top of overlays and keylogging, the malware monitors WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and other messaging apps. It waits for these apps to decrypt messages locally, then captures the text right from the screen. This means your chats may remain encrypted over the network, but once the message appears on your display, Sturnus sees the entire conversation. It also includes a full remote control feature with live screen streaming and a more efficient mode that sends only interface data. This allows precise taps, text injection, scrolling and permission approvals without showing any activity to the victim.",
      "How Sturnus stays hidden and steals money",
      "The malware protects itself by grabbing Device Administrator privileges and blocking any attempt to remove it. If you open the settings page that could disable those permissions, Sturnus detects it immediately and moves you away from the screen before you can act. It also monitors battery state, SIM changes, developer mode, network conditions and even signs of forensic investigation to decide how to behave. All this data goes back to the command-and-control server through a mix of WebSocket and HTTP channels protected with RSA and AES encryption.",
      "When it comes to financial theft, the malware has several ways to take over your accounts. It can collect credentials through overlays, keylogging, UI-tree monitoring and direct text injection. If needed, it can black out your screen with a full-screen overlay while the attacker performs fraudulent transactions in the background. Since the screen is hidden, you have no idea anything is happening until it is too late.",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from Android malware like Sturnus",
      "If you want to protect yourself from threats like this, here are a few practical things you can start doing right away.",
      "Avoid downloading APKs from forwarded links, shady websites, Telegram groups or third-party app stores. Banking malware spreads most effectively through sideloaded installers disguised as updates, coupons or new features. If you need an app that isn't in the Play Store, verify the developer's official site, check hashes if provided and read recent reviews to make sure the app hasn't been hijacked.",
      "Most dangerous malware relies on accessibility permissions because they allow full visibility into your screen and interactions. Device administrator rights are even more powerful since they can block removal. If a simple utility app suddenly asks for these, stop immediately. These permissions should only be granted to apps that genuinely need them, such as password managers or accessibility tools you trust.",
      "Install system updates as soon as they arrive, since many Android banking trojans target older devices that lack the latest security patches. If your phone is no longer receiving updates, you are at a higher risk, especially when using financial apps. Avoid sideloading custom ROMs unless you know how they handle security patches and Google Play Protect.",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "The malware quietly captures decrypted messages from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal right as they appear on your screen. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Android phones come with Google Play Protect built in, which catches a large chunk of known malware families and warns you when apps behave suspiciously. But if you want greater security and control, choose a third-party antivirus app. These tools can alert you when an app starts logging your screen or trying to take over your phone.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "A lot of these campaigns rely on data brokers, leaked databases and scraped profiles to build lists of people to target. If your phone number, email, address or social handles are floating around on dozens of broker sites, it becomes much easier for attackers to reach you with malware links or tailored scams. A personal data removal service helps clean up that footprint by deleting your info from data broker listings.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Trojan overlays often appear when you open your bank app or a popular service. If the screen layout looks different or asks for credentials in a way you don't recognize, close the app completely. Reopen it from your app drawer and see if the prompt returns.

      "With remote control tools that stream your screen and automate taps, attackers can move money behind the scenes without you noticing. (Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Attackers frequently distribute malware through WhatsApp links, SMS messages and email attachments pretending to be invoices, refunds or delivery updates. If you receive a link you weren't expecting, open your browser manually and search for the service instead. Avoid installing anything that comes from a message, even if it appears to be from someone you know. Compromised accounts are a common delivery method.",
      "DATA BREACH EXPOSES 400,000 BANK CUSTOMERS\u2019 INFO",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Sturnus is still a young malware family, but it already stands out for how much control it gives attackers. It sidesteps encrypted messaging, steals banking credentials with multiple backup methods, and maintains a strong grip on the device through administrator privileges and constant environmental checks. Even if the current campaigns are limited, the level of sophistication here suggests a threat that is being refined for larger operations. If it reaches wide distribution, it could become one of the most damaging Android banking trojans in circulation.",

      "Skovsporet, described as Europe's largest 3D-printed housing project, is now taking shape in Holstebro. When finished, the development will deliver 36 student apartments built faster than many single-family homes.",
      "The project sits near VIA University College and serves students in the area. NordVestBo, an affordable housing organization focused on student living, commissioned the development. SAGA Space Architects designed the project in collaboration with 3DCP Group and COBOD. From the beginning, the goal stayed simple and ambitious. Build high-quality homes faster, more efficiently and at a scale traditional construction often struggles to reach. So far, the progress speaks for itself.",

      "How 36 student apartments were printed at record speed",
      "Skovsporet includes six buildings, and each one holds six ground-level student apartments. Crews printed the structures on site using the COBOD BOD3 3D construction printer. The machine extrudes a cement-like material layer by layer, following a digital blueprint with millimeter accuracy.",
      "At first, printing a single building took several weeks. However, productivity improved quickly as the team gained experience. By the final building, printing wrapped up in just five days. That pace equals more than one student apartment printed per day.",
      "Even more notable is the small crew required to run the system. Only three people operated the printer on site. As a result, automation handled the heavy work while the team focused on oversight, quality and precision.",
      "Inside the 3D-printed student apartments",
      "Each apartment measures roughly 431 to 538 square feet. Despite their compact footprint, the layouts feel open and intentional. Every unit includes a full kitchen, a study area, a lounge, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom with a double bed. Large roof windows and slanted ceilings pull daylight deep into the space, helping soften the concrete structure. Inside, coated plywood panels and glass elements add warmth and contrast. The result feels modern and livable rather than industrial. These homes are designed for daily student life, not just architectural headlines.",
      "AFFORDABLE 3D-PRINTED BIONIC ARM USES MUSCLE SIGNALS TO MOVE",
      "Why 3D printed construction is changing how housing gets built",
      "The real story at Skovsporet is not just speed. It is repeatability. As the team moved from one building to the next, efficiency improved without sacrificing quality. The BOD3 printer runs on a ground-based track system that allows uninterrupted printing of long wall sections. That consistency makes it easier to scale multi-unit housing projects.",
      "According to COBOD, this kind of automation reduces labor needs, shortens timelines and improves accuracy. For cities facing housing shortages, those benefits matter.",
      "How sustainability is built into this 3D printed housing project",
      "Skovsporet also shows how 3D printing supports more sustainable construction. The walls were printed using D.fab concrete with FUTURECEM, a low-carbon cement developed by Aalborg Portland. Because the printer deposits material only where it is structurally needed, waste drops significantly compared to traditional methods. The site layout also preserved 95% of the existing trees by carefully positioning print beds between them. In other words, faster construction did not come at the cost of environmental care.",

      "The 3D printing phase is now complete. Human crews have taken over to install roofs, windows, interiors, furniture and utilities. Landscaped gardens, walking paths and bicycle parking are also underway to create a shared village atmosphere. The project remains on schedule, with residents expected to move in by August 2026.",
      "WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS ARE UNDERWAY IN QATAR",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you care about housing affordability, this project is worth watching. Skovsporet proves that automation can deliver student housing faster while keeping quality high. It also hints at what could come next. Multiunit housing built with fewer workers, less waste and shorter timelines could ease pressure in crowded cities. While 3D-printed homes will not replace traditional construction overnight, they are clearly moving into the mainstream. For students, renters and communities, that shift could open the door to more accessible housing options.",

    "summary": "New SantaStealer malware reportedly threatens holiday shoppers with password theft. This Christmas-themed info-stealer targets browsers and crypto wallets.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips for safe holiday shopping and finding the best deals on Cyber Monday.",
      "Christmas is around the corner, and so is the SantaStealer malware. While the name sounds jolly, this malware is more than capable of ruining your happiness this festive season. The worst part is that this new strain is available to almost anyone willing to pay a small fee. It essentially works as malware-as-a-service, letting buyers target people at scale, obviously not for any legitimate use.",
      "SantaStealer is starting to make noise across Telegram channels and underground hacker forums. It is being marketed as a stealthy, memory-only information stealer that can quietly siphon data without leaving obvious traces on disk.",
      "Memory-only does not mean undetectable. It simply reduces disk artifacts, which can delay detection rather than prevent it altogether. That promise alone is enough to attract cybercriminals, especially at a time when browser-stored passwords, session cookies and crypto wallets remain high-value targets.",
      "MALICIOUS BROWSER EXTENSIONS HIT 4.3M USERS",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "SantaStealer malware is spreading ahead of Christmas, with cybercriminals marketing the data-stealing tool for hire across Telegram and underground forums. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SantaStealer and how it actually works",
      "SantaStealer operates as a malware-as-a-service, charging $175 per month for its basic tier and $300 per month for the premium plan. Researchers at Rapid7 say the operation rebrands an earlier project called BluelineStealer, with a Russian-speaking developer pushing toward a wider launch before the end of the year.",
      "Despite bold claims about evading detection, Rapid7's analysis paints a more grounded picture. The samples they examined were not particularly difficult to analyze and lacked the advanced anti-analysis techniques being advertised, which is good news for us. If it can be detected, security tools have a better chance of removing it before it can do serious damage.",
      "Functionally, SantaStealer is still dangerous. It uses 14 separate data-collection modules that run in parallel, pulling information from browsers, messaging apps like Telegram and Discord, gaming platforms such as Steam, crypto wallet apps and extensions, and even local documents. The malware can also take screenshots of your desktop. Stolen data is written to memory, compressed into ZIP files and sent out in 10MB chunks to a hardcoded command-and-control server.",
      "One notable capability is its use of an embedded executable to get around Chrome's App-Bound Encryption, a security feature introduced in mid-2024. This workaround typically requires the malware to be executed at the user level and is not a remote bypass of Chrome's security model. Similar tricks have already been used by other info-stealers, showing how quickly attackers test and adapt to new browser protections.",
      "What this says about the current threat landscape",
      "SantaStealer is not fully operational yet and has not been distributed at scale, but it reflects a broader trend in cybercrime. Modern info-stealers are modular, configurable and sold much like regular software. The affiliate panel that Rapid7 observed allows buyers to fine-tune exactly what data the malware steals, from full system sweeps to narrowly targeted attacks focused on specific apps or crypto wallets.",
      "The malware also includes options to avoid infecting systems in certain regions and to delay execution, which can throw off both victims and security analysts. As for how SantaStealer might spread, researchers say recent campaigns increasingly rely on ClickFix-style attacks. These tricks push victims into pasting malicious commands directly into the Windows terminal, often disguised as steps to fix an issue or enable a feature.",
      "More traditional methods are still very much in play. Phishing emails, pirated software, torrent downloads, malicious ads and even deceptive YouTube comments remain effective delivery channels. Once malware like this runs on a system, it needs very little time to grab saved passwords, session cookies and wallet data that can later be abused or sold.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from SantaStealer malware",
      "A few sensible habits and the right tools can significantly reduce your risk, even if malware like this continues to evolve. Here are seven practical steps you can take to stay safe:",
      "Modern antivirus tools don't just look for known malware signatures. They also monitor suspicious behavior, such as programs trying to grab browser data or run hidden processes. Keep real-time protection enabled and take alerts seriously instead of dismissing them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Updates are not just about new features. They often patch security flaws that malware actively targets. This includes your OS, browser, browser extensions, crypto wallet apps and messaging tools. Delaying updates gives attackers a wider window to exploit known weaknesses.",
      "Info-stealers love browser-saved passwords because they are easy to grab. A password manager stores your credentials in an encrypted vault and reduces what your browser keeps locally. It also helps you use strong, unique passwords for every service without having to remember them.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Even if your password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from getting in. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS codes and should be your first choice for email, crypto exchanges, cloud services and social media accounts.",
      "ClickFix-style attacks rely on trust and urgency. If a website, pop-up or video tells you to paste a command into the Windows terminal to fix something, stop. Unless you fully understand what that command does, assume it is dangerous.",
      "When your email, phone number or other personal details are widely available online, attackers can target you more convincingly. Personal data removal services help take your information down from data broker sites, reducing the chances of targeted phishing or malware lures.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Stick to official app stores, trusted developers and verified extensions, even if it means skipping a \"free\" download.",
      "SantaStealer can quietly siphon sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "SantaStealer may not yet live up to its own hype, but that should not make you complacent. Early-stage malware often improves quickly once developers patch obvious mistakes. Be cautious with links and attachments from unfamiliar emails, and think twice before running unverified code or browser extensions pulled from public repositories.",

      "At 18, Jamie Grohsong was living a dream many young athletes chase for years. He was a three-time all-conference shortstop, a Division I college prospect and a player who lived for the game. Then one Fourth of July night in 2023, everything changed. A firework exploded in his hand. In seconds, Jamie lost his pitching hand, his season and what felt like his entire baseball future. The path he had worked toward since childhood disappeared. For a while, Jamie accepted that reality. Baseball, the sport that shaped his identity, was over.",

      "AI-POWERED BAT TRACKING COULD GIVE BASEBALL PLAYERS THE EDGE",
      "Jamie Grohsong throws a baseball using a bionic prosthetic hand after losing his pitching hand in a fireworks accident. His return shows how technology can help athletes reclaim what they love. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When technology reopens a closed door",
      "Two years later, Jamie stepped back onto a baseball field wearing something he never imagined using. A bionic prosthetic known as the Ability Hand.",
      "\"The fact that I can feel and sense everything to the finest details opened my mind to the possibility of everything that could actually be done,\" he told CyberGuy.",
      "The goal was not to recreate the past. It was to find out what might still be possible.",
      "Engineers who build advanced prosthetic hands saw Jamie's story and reached out with a simple question. What if he did not have to give up the game entirely? That question started an extraordinary journey that blended grit, patience and cutting-edge engineering.",
      "\"When building the Ability Hand, we prioritized real-life usage,\" Dr. Aadeel Akhtar, founder and CEO of PSYONIC, told CyberGuy. \"While we already put the hand through its fair share of stress tests, baseball is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Baseball is definitely a brutal test for any piece of equipment. Throwing requires precise release timing. Hitting demands force, stability and follow-through. At first, nothing came easily.",
      "Learning how to throw again",
      "Throwing a baseball with a bionic hand is not about raw strength. It is about timing and grip. The Ability Hand uses muscle sensors that detect subtle movements in the arm. During a throw, many muscles activate at once, which can cause the hand to open too early. Early throws slipped away. Some felt right. Others did not.",
      "Instead of forcing the hand to grip harder, the PSYONIC team adjusted the technique. Jamie learned to hold the ball lightly and let momentum release it naturally. Small grip changes made a real difference. Slowly, throws began to land. Then they became repeatable. For Jamie, each clean throw rebuilt confidence that had been missing for two years.",

      "The pitch was not perfect. That never mattered. Standing on a Major League Baseball field with a bionic hand, Jamie proved something bigger than accuracy. He showed that the game was still part of him. Later, he said the experience taught him that life does not require perfection to be meaningful.",

      "Throwing was only part of the challenge.\u00a0Hitting posed an even bigger question.",
      "\"Swinging a bat was a feeling I didn't think I'd feel again,\" Jamie said.",
      "Engineers discovered that bat placement matters more with prosthetics than with natural hands. When the bionic hand serves as the bottom hand on the bat, impact spreads across the fingers. When it sits on top, stress concentrates on the thumb. Jamie bats left-handed, which placed the prosthetic in a safer position. He told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"I can hit with this thing for sure.\"",
      "Then came the first swings. The sensation was unfamiliar. The contact felt strange. Still, the bat met the ball. One swing turned into another. Soon, balls started flying deep into the field. Then it happened. Jamie sent one over the fence.",
      "A world-first moment",
      "Those swings marked what many believe to be the first documented home runs hit using a multi-articulating bionic hand. For Jamie, it was more than a technical milestone. It was emotional closure and a new beginning at the same time. He was not trying to prove that prosthetics make athletes better. He was proving that they can help people reconnect with what they love. The bionic hand did not replace his identity. It gave him a new way to express it.",

Even so, advanced prosthetics remain expensive and imperfect, and they can break under stress. Because of that, users need time, training and patience to adapt. Yet stories like this show how powerful thoughtful engineering can be when it works alongside human determination.

      "The FBI is warning about a disturbing scam that turns family photos into powerful weapons. Cybercriminals are stealing images from social media accounts, altering them and using them as fake proof of life in virtual kidnapping scams.",
      "These scams do not involve real abductions. Instead, criminals rely on fear, speed and believable images to pressure victims into paying ransom before they can think clearly.",

      "Scammers steal photos from public social media accounts and manipulate them to create fake proof of life images that fuel fear and urgency. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the fake kidnapping scam works",
      "According to the FBI, scammers usually start with a text message. They claim they have kidnapped a loved one and demand immediate payment for their release. To make the threat feel real, the criminals send an altered photo pulled from social media. The FBI says these images may be sent using timed messages to limit how long victims can examine them. The agency warns that scammers often threaten extreme violence if the ransom is not paid right away. This urgency is designed to shut down rational thinking.",
      "Signs the photo may be fake",
      "When victims slow down and look closely, the altered images often fall apart. The FBI says warning signs may include missing scars or tattoos, strange body proportions or details that do not match reality. Scammers may also spoof a loved one's phone number, which makes the message feel even more convincing. Reports on sites like Reddit show this tactic is already being used in the real world.",
      "Why this fake kidnapping scam is so effective",
      "Virtual kidnapping scams work because they exploit emotion. Fear pushes people to act fast, especially when the message appears to come from someone they trust. The FBI notes that criminals use publicly available information to personalize their threats. Even posts meant to help others, such as missing person searches, can provide useful details for scammers.",

      "Review the privacy settings on every social platform you use. Set profiles to private so only trusted friends and family can see your photos, posts and personal updates. Virtual kidnapping scams rely heavily on publicly visible images. Limiting access makes it harder for criminals to steal photos and create fake proof-of-life images.",

      "Avoid posting real-time travel updates, daily routines or detailed family information. Even close-up photos that show tattoos, scars or locations can give scammers useful material. The less context criminals have, the harder it is for them to make a threat feel real and urgent.",
      "Install strong antivirus software on computers, phones and tablets. Strong protection helps block phishing links, malicious downloads and spyware often tied to scam campaigns. Keeping your operating system and security tools updated also closes security gaps that criminals exploit to gather personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Review older public photo albums and remove images that clearly show faces from multiple angles. Avoid posting large collections of high-resolution facial photos publicly. Scammers often need multiple images to convincingly alter photos. Reducing facial data weakens their ability to manipulate images.",
      "Create a simple verification plan with loved ones before an emergency happens. This may include a shared code word, a call back rule or a second trusted contact. Scammers depend on panic. Having a preset way to verify safety gives you something steady to rely on when emotions run high.",
      "Contact your mobile carrier and ask about SIM protection or a port-out PIN. This helps prevent criminals from hijacking phone numbers or spoofing calls and texts. Since many fake kidnapping scams begin with messages that appear to come from a loved one, securing phone accounts adds an important layer of protection.",
      "The FBI warns that these virtual kidnapping scams often begin with a text message that pressures victims to pay a ransom immediately. (Getty Images)",
      "If you receive a threat, save screenshots, phone numbers, images and message details. Do not continue engaging with the sender. Report the incident to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Even if no money is lost, reports help investigators track patterns and warn others.",

      "A major data breach tied to fintech firm Marquis exposed sensitive banking and identity data for hundreds of thousands of people. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information was stolen in the Marquis cyberattack",
      "According to legally required disclosures filed in Texas, Maine, Iowa, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, hackers accessed a wide range of personal and financial data. Stolen information includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account, debit and credit card numbers. The breach dates back to Aug. 14, when attackers gained access through the SonicWall firewall vulnerability. Marquis later confirmed the incident was a ransomware attack.",
      "While Marquis did not publicly name the attackers, the campaign has been widely linked to the Akira ransomware gang. Akira has previously targeted organizations running SonicWall appliances during large-scale exploitation waves. This was not a routine credential leak.",
      "We reached out to Marquis for comment, and a company spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"In August, Marquis Marketing Services experienced a data security incident. Upon discovery, we immediately enacted our response protocols and proactively took the affected systems offline to protect our data and our customers\u2019 information. We engaged leading third-party cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive investigation and notified law enforcement.",
      "\"The incident was quickly contained, and our investigation was recently completed. It was determined that an unauthorized third party accessed certain non-public information within our network. However, there is no evidence indicating that any personal information has been used for identity theft or financial fraud. We have notified potentially affected individuals.",
      "\"We know our customers place great trust in us, and at Marquis, we take that responsibility seriously by making the protection of their information our highest priority. We are extremely appreciative of the cooperation, understanding, and support of our employees and customers during this time.\"",
      "HOW TO STOP IMPOSTOR BANK SCAMS BEFORE THEY DRAIN YOUR WALLET",
      "Why the Marquis data breach creates long-term identity risk",
      "When a data breach exposes your full identity, the danger does not disappear after the news cycle ends. Unlike a stolen password, this kind of information cannot be changed, which means the risk can stick around for a long time.",
      "\"With a typical credential leak, you reset passwords, rotate tokens and move on,\" Ricardo Amper, CEO and Founder of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, tells CyberGuy. \"But core identity data is static. You cannot meaningfully change your date of birth or SSN, and once those are exposed, they can circulate on criminal markets for years. The breach is a moment in time, but the exposure it creates can follow people for the rest of their financial lives.\"",
      "That is why identity breaches are so dangerous. Criminals can reuse the same stolen data years later to open new accounts, build fake identities or run highly targeted scams that feel personal and convincing. Many attackers now combine this data with AI tools to scale their efforts. As a result, phishing emails, phone calls and even voice impersonations are harder to spot when they reference real details about your bank or account history.",
      "The most likely scams after identity data is stolen",
      "When criminals obtain verified identity data, fraud becomes targeted rather than opportunistic.",
      "\"Once criminals get their hands on rich, verified identity data, fraud stops being a guessing game and becomes a targeted execution,\" Amper said.",
      "The first major threat is account takeover. With enough personal details, attackers can bypass knowledge-based checks, reset passwords, change contact information and abuse accounts in ways that often look legitimate. The second risk is new account fraud. This includes credit cards, loans, buy now pay later services and even new bank accounts. High-quality data helps these applications pass automated systems and manual reviews.",
      "The fastest-growing threat is synthetic identity fraud. Real data, like a Social Security number, is blended with fabricated details to create a new identity that matures over time before a large financial bust.",
      "\"These attacks are hard to catch early because the data being presented is accurate and often reused across multiple institutions,\" Amper noted. \"If your defenses can't reliably tell a real human from an AI-generated impersonation, you are starting every decision from a position of disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Why unpatched firewall flaws pose such a serious threat",
      "Ransomware groups like Akira increasingly focus on widely deployed infrastructure to maximize impact. Firewalls sit at the boundary of trusted networks. When one is compromised, everything behind it becomes reachable.",
      "\"What we're seeing with groups like Akira is a focus on maximizing impact by targeting widely used infrastructure. The strategy remains the same: Find a single weak point that gives access to many downstream victims at once,\" Amper said.",
      "This approach exposes a persistent blind spot in traditional cybersecurity thinking. Many organizations still assume traffic passing through a firewall is safe.",
      "\"When the perimeter device itself is the entry point, static defenses and outdated controls simply can't keep up,\" Amper explained.",
      "Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers and bank details by exploiting an unpatched firewall vulnerability.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How long affected consumers should assume risk remains high",
      "Identity data does not expire. Social Security numbers and birth dates stay the same for life.",
      "\"When core identity data reaches criminal markets, the risk does not fade quickly,\" Amper emphasized. \"Fraud rings treat stolen identity data like inventory. They hold it, bundle it, resell it and combine it with information from new breaches.\"",
      "Warning signs of misuse can be subtle. These include credit inquiries you did not authorize, account recovery alerts from unfamiliar services or phone calls that convincingly mimic a bank's verification process using deepfake voice tools.",
      "\"The most damaging fraud often starts long after the breach is no longer in the news,\" Amper added.",
      "The overlooked impact of identity theft",
      "Financial losses are only part of the damage. Victims often experience a lasting erosion of trust.",
      "Amper says, \"The most overlooked consequence is the psychological toll of knowing that you can no longer trust who is contacting you. Deepfake impersonation turns every phone call, video message or urgent request into a potential attack.\"",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Marquis data breach",
      "When a breach exposes Social Security numbers, bank details and birth dates, the risk does not end with a password reset. These steps focus on protections that reduce long-term identity misuse and help you detect fraud early.",
      "A credit freeze prevents criminals from opening new accounts in your name using stolen identity data. This is critical after the Marquis breach, where full identity profiles were exposed. Freezing credit does not affect your score and can be lifted temporarily when needed. Place a free credit freeze with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion online or by phone. Each bureau must be contacted separately. Once frozen, new credit cannot be opened unless you temporarily lift or remove the freeze using a PIN or account login.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. It adds protection if you are not ready to freeze credit everywhere or want an extra layer on top of a freeze. Fraud alerts last for one year and can be renewed. You only need to contact one credit bureau to place a fraud alert. Equifax, Experian or TransUnion will notify the others for you. Fraud alerts are free and last for one year.",
      "Turn on alerts for withdrawal, purchase, login attempts and password changes across all financial accounts. Real-time alerts can help you catch account takeovers or unauthorized activity before serious damage occurs.",
      "Check statements and credit reports often, even months or years after the breach. Identity data from incidents like this is frequently reused later for delayed fraud. Watch for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or small test charges.",
      "Text message codes can be intercepted or socially engineered. Where possible, switch to app-based or hardware-backed two-factor authentication. These options are harder for attackers to bypass, even when they know your personal details.",
      "Biometrics tied to your physical device add a layer that criminals cannot easily replicate. Face and fingerprint authentication help block account takeovers driven by stolen identity data or AI-powered impersonation.",
      "Reputable antivirus software helps detect malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up attacks that target breach victims. This adds protection against phishing and ransomware tied to identity-based scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",

      "Create or secure online accounts with the IRS, Social Security Administration and your state tax agency. Enable strong authentication and monitor for unexpected notices. Stolen identity data is often used for tax refund fraud or benefit scams long after a breach.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Marquis data breach highlights how dangerous unpatched infrastructure vulnerabilities have become for the financial sector. When a single vendor holds data for hundreds of institutions, the fallout spreads quickly. For you, identity protection is no longer a one-time response. It is an ongoing necessity that can last years beyond the initial breach.",

      "As we head into the last stretch of December (and last-minute gift shopping), your doorstep is probably busier than ever. And if you're anything like me, you're probably also juggling shipping updates, tracking numbers, and \"out for delivery\" alerts from half a dozen retailers.",
      "Unfortunately, scammers know this too, and they've likely been preparing for it all year. Like clockwork, I've already started seeing the usual wave of fake tracking texts hitting people's phones. They look legit, they show up right when you're expecting a package, and they rely on one inescapable truth: during the holiday rush, most of us are too overwhelmed to notice when something feels off.",

      "What fake delivery text messages look like",
      "Most of these fake shipping texts include a \"tracking link\" that looks close enough to the real thing that you might tap without thinking twice about it. In some cases, like one Maryland woman found out, you may even receive\u00a0fake deliveries with a QR code\u00a0that works in a similar way.",
      "These links usually lead to a spoofed tracking page that looks almost identical to the real thing. It'll ask you to \"confirm\" your login or enter your delivery details. The moment you type anything in, scammers capture it and use it to access your real accounts.",
      "Even worse, the \"tracking link\" may contain\u00a0malware\u00a0or\u00a0spyware, triggering silent installs that can steal passwords, monitor keystrokes, or give scammers remote access to your device.",
      "Red flags that reveal fake shipping and tracking messages",
      "So how can you distinguish between a legitimate message for a delivery you're actually waiting for and one of these scams? Here are the red flags I look for:",
      "Weird or slightly altered URLs. Scammers use domains that look almost right.

If the text is vague or you can't match it to a recent order, pause before you tap anything.Delivery attempts at odd hours. \"Missed delivery at 6:12 AM\" or \"late-night attempt\" messages are usually fake. Carriers don't normally operate like that.Updates that don't match what you see in the retailer's app or email. If Amazon says your package is arriving tomorrow, but a random text says it's delayed or stuck, trust Amazon, not the text.Language that is designed to rush you.

      "These data brokers can sell profiles containing hundreds of data points on you. And they aren't always discerning about who they sell to. In fact, some of them have been caught intentionally selling data to scammers.",
      "Once scammers have those details, creating a convincing delivery scam is no problem.",
      "But scammers can't target what they can't find",
      "I've been very vocal about the importance of keeping personal information under lock and key. And this is just one of the reasons why.",
      "Criminals rely on your personal information to target you with these types of scams. They also need at least a phone number or email address to reach you in the first place.",
      "So your best bet to avoid delivery scams (and, honestly, most other scams year-round) is removing your info from data brokers and people search sites. Doing this will keep your details out of circulation online and out of the wrong hands.",
      "FBI WARNS EMAIL USERS AS HOLIDAY SCAMS SURGE",
      "Fraudsters use spoofed shipping pages and malware to capture passwords and gain access to victims\u2019 devices. (Martin Ollman/Getty Images)",
      "How to remove your personal information from scammers' reach",
      "You can start by looking yourself up online. Searching for different combinations of your name, address, email, and phone number should bring up a bunch of people search sites. Just visit the \"opt-out\" page on each site to request removal of your data.",
      "Private-database data brokers are a bit trickier. They sell data in bulk, usually to marketers and other third parties. So you won't be able to check if they have your information. But if you look into which data brokers operate in your area, you can just send opt-out requests to them all. There's a good chance they'll have your information.",
      "You can also turn to a data removal service. They completely remove the headache from this process and just automatically keep your personal info off data broker sites. If, like me, you don't have the time to keep manually checking data broker sites and sending removal requests every few months (because your data will keep reappearing), a personal data removal service is the way to go.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Holiday delivery scams work because they blend perfectly into the chaos of December shopping. A well-timed text and a familiar tracking link are often all it takes to lower your guard. By slowing down, checking messages directly with retailers, and reducing how much of your personal data is circulating online, you can take away the advantage scammers rely on. A little caution now can save you a major headache later.",

      "She said, \"We went up and down the streets day and night. We went online in the neighborhood and on Love Lost. We put up flyers all over the neighborhood. Friends and neighbors were looking for him. I went to the animal shelter, posted him there, and went every day for over a month, hoping to find him.\"",
      "Pam uploaded Grayson's photo to Petco Love Lost right away. She checked her daily match alerts and hoped she would see his familiar face pop up. She told CyberGuy, \"I received match alerts almost every day from Lost Love, but never saw Grayson. His profile had been on their site for over 90 days.\"",
      "The moment everything changed",
      "Missy, a nearby resident, spotted a thin cat in an alley near her home. She brought him inside, took a picture of him and then turned to Love Lost to see if anyone had reported a missing cat like him.",
      "Missy explained how simple the process felt. \"I used Lost Love to reunite them,\" she said. \"I uploaded a photo of the cat that we found, and it was matched through AI with the photo that the owner uploaded.\"",
      "She soon received an AI match alert and learned that the cross street Grayson's owner, Pam, had listed in her lost post was only a mile from her home. Missy contacted Pam right away.",
      "That message changed everything. \"I am sure that if we had not posted his picture and enabled the ability to match the images, we would never have known what happened to Grayson,\" Pam said. \"And we would not have connected with Missy.\"",

      "Pam said she still thinks about what those months were like for him. \"[I] guess I will always wonder where he was and how many stops he made before he reached Missy's loving home,\" she said. \"He must have known she would take care of him.

      "How AirTags can help you find a lost pet faster",
      "While tools like AI photo matching are invaluable after a pet goes missing, prevention and real-time tracking can make an enormous difference during the first critical hours. That's where Apple AirTags come in. An AirTag isn't a GPS tracker, but it can still be a powerful recovery tool when used correctly. When attached securely to your pet's collar, an AirTag uses Apple's vast Find My network. That network consists of hundreds of millions of nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs that can anonymously and securely relay the AirTag's location back to you.",
      "If your pet wanders into a neighborhood, apartment complex or busy area, the chances are high that another Apple device will pass nearby and update the location automatically. You won't know who helped, and they won't know it was them, but the location can show up on your map within minutes. For indoor cats or dogs that don't usually roam far, this can be especially helpful. Even a rough location can narrow your search area and save precious time.",
      "Important limits to know: AirTags work best in populated areas. They rely on nearby Apple devices, so coverage may be limited in rural or remote locations. They also don't update continuously like true GPS pet trackers. That's why AirTags should be seen as a backup layer, not a replacement for microchipping or dedicated pet trackers.",
      "How to use an AirTag safely with pets",
      "Use a\u00a0secure, pet-specific AirTag holder that won't break easily.Attach it to a\u00a0breakaway collar\u00a0for cats and dogs to reduce injury risk.Make sure\u00a0Find My notifications are turned on so you get alerts quickly.Combine it with\u00a0microchipping and ID tags for the best protection.",

      "In its latest report, the IPC\u2019s Famine Review Committee addressed the changing circumstances, explaining that \"following the publication of the [last] FRC report, there was a partial relaxation of the blockade and an increase in the availability of food and other essential supplies.\" While the FRC says this \"came too late to avoid famine in Gaza Governorate in July and early August, the persistence of Famine and its spread to other governorates during the projection period has been avoided.\"",

      "Dr. Reuben Kirkham argues Australia\u2019s government is using the Bondi Beach attack to push broader vilification laws that could increase censorship without addressing the root causes of antisemitism.",
      "In the wake of the mass shooting attack at Bondi Beach during a Hanukkah celebration, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a national gun buyback program and proposed new hate speech laws.",
      "While the legislation has not yet been drafted, it is already causing controversy as fears that the laws could be wielded as political weapons emerge. Critics have also said that neither the gun buyback nor the hate speech laws are addressing the root of what led to the terror attack.",
      "\"Well, it's a bit hard for them to actually strengthen the laws. It's not clear what they're proposing to do,\" Dr. Reuben Kirkham, one of the directors of the Free Speech Union of Australia, told Fox News Digital. \"What they're probably going to try and do is widen it to include a bunch of things that are not to do with hate speech, necessarily.\"",
      "Albanese told reporters on Friday that the government was working to \"get the laws right\" and acknowledged the complexities surrounding the issue. He said, \"There are issues of free speech involved in this as well \u2014 we want to make sure that these laws don't get passed and then get knocked over.\"",

      "The proposed changes include federal offenses for \"aggravated hate speech\" aimed at preachers who promote violence and \"serious vilification\" based on race, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. The outlet noted that just 10 months ago, the government strengthened federal hate speech laws with the goal of curbing antisemitism and Islamophobia.",
      "Simultaneously, New South Wales (NSW), where the terror attack took place, is considering banning chants of the phrase \"globalize the intifada,\" which many consider to be an antisemitic call for violence against Jews. The ban would also apply to public displays of ISIS flags and extremist symbols.",
      "Additionally, NSW Premier Chris Minns said, under the ban, police would be given more powers to demand that protesters remove face coverings during demonstrations, according to The Associated Press.",

      "Kirkham told Fox News Digital that existing anti-vilification laws have already been used to shut down speech that opposes government views. He believes that if these laws are strengthened in the wake of the Bondi Beach shooting, they would be used as political weapons, rather than protections for everyday people. Additionally, Kirkham said he sees this as the government using the attack as an opportunity to pass laws that fit its views.",
      "Furthermore, Kirkham argues that Albanese's proposal could actually increase antisemitism rather than put an end to it.",
      "\"What they\u2019re basically saying is, \u2018Well, we need more censorship laws. Why? Well, apparently to protect Jewish people.\u2019 So what they\u2019re saying to these communities is, \u2018We\u2019re censoring you to protect the Jews.\u2019 I mean, how is that going to go down? Is that going to improve the issue of antisemitism, or is it going to make it worse?\"",
      "While the Australian government has focused its response on hate speech and gun laws, critics, such as Kirkham, say the Bondi Beach attack revealed intelligence failures.",
      "Albanese said Friday that intelligence indicated that the attack at Bondi Beach was in fact inspired by ISIS.",
      "\"We've been informed that the Office of National Intelligence has identified a regular online video feed from ISIS that reinforces that this was an ISIS-inspired attack. Further work has been done by the security agencies around motivation, and we'll continue to meet and provide them with whatever support they need at this difficult time,\" Albanese told reporters.",

      "They also have trouble getting loans from traditional banks, where cannabis companies are viewed as high-risk clients.",
      "Ever since the Controlled Substances Act was signed into law in 1970, federal regulators have grouped cannabis together with some of the most restricted drugs in America, such as heroin and LSD.",
      "This classification, known as Schedule I, is reserved for drugs the government believes have no known medical benefit and a high risk of dependence. Manufacturing, buying, selling and possessing Schedule I controlled narcotics without specific authorization is a federal crime.",
      "As long as cannabis remains classified under Schedule I, nearly every dollar earned by the industry could be construed as the proceeds of a federal crime.",
      "This legal status has kept the cannabis industry trapped on the fringes of the U.S. financial system, even as retail revenues grew to an estimated $30 billion last year.",
      "But this could all change now that President Donald Trump has ordered the Justice Department to fast-track the reclassification of cannabis.",

      "But experts and dispensary operators say the coming status change could be a watershed moment for the cannabis industry, paving the way for dispensaries and growers to access traditional banking services, get loans and process electronic payments.",
      "Cash only",
      "Elad Kohen is founder and CEO of The Flowery, a cannabis company that operates 26 stores across Florida and New York. The company employs about 600 people, said Kohen, but it still can\u2019t process credit or debit card payments for cannabis.",
      "Instead, the business is forced to operate in cash, creating a constant security risk for its employees.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with paper, which makes you a target\u201d for crime, Kohen said. If a dispensary is robbed, \u201cmost of the time they rob you for cash, they don\u2019t rob you for product.\u201d",
      "The reclassification of cannabis could transform Kohen\u2019s cash-based operation by lowering the barriers that keep digital payment processors out of the cannabis market.",
      "With an electronic paper trail of revenues and expenses, dispensaries would look more credible and verifiable to banks and potential lenders, said Amiyatosh Purnanandam, a professor of finance at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas, Austin, and an expert in corporate finance.",
      "Longer-term, it could make it easier for cannabis companies to get financing and grow.",
      "At stake are billions of dollars in revenues and potentially tens of thousands of American jobs.",
      "\u201cWe are not asking for anything special other than being [treated] like a normal company, having the ability to raise capital like a normal company, be able to fund research like a normal company, [and] have financial services available to us like a normal company,\u201d said Kohen.",
      "A risky business",
      "But this is a tall order for many banks. The cannabis industry is currently \u201cnot seen in the same light as any other business,\u201d said Purnanandam.",
      "In 2024, the legal cannabis market in the U.S. employed more than 400,000 people, according to an industry research firm. The Pew Research Center estimates the number of licensed dispensaries at nearly 15,000.",
      "Despite these numbers and consistent year-over-year growth, traditional banks are still hesitant to serve the cannabis industry.",
      "There are three main obstacles, said Purnanandam: \u201cLegal uncertainty, value of collateral and concern about suspicious activities.\u201d",
      "All these barriers, he said, \u201clikely will come down after the reclassification of cannabis.\u201d",
      "Currently, \u201cyou have this conflict\u201d between state and federal level cannabis laws, said Purnanandam. \u201cBanks don\u2019t want to deal with the conflict.\u201d",
      "Companies that process cashless payments like debit cards confront the same dilemma.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to face either the legal or reputational risk of dealing in payments that [are] not legal\u201d under federal law, said Purnanandam.",
      "The second obstacle is getting a loan. The assets that banks typically require as collateral to guarantee business loans are not as straightforward in the cannabis industry as they are for other businesses.",
      "If a cannabis company were to default on a bank loan, for example, and its cash was still considered the proceeds of a federal crime, it could complicate efforts to dispose of the company\u2019s assets.",
      "\u201cThe value of that collateral, in banks\u2019 minds, falls if cannabis is not treated as any other industry, like a restaurant on the street corner,\u201d said Purnanandam.",
      "Tax trouble",
      "In addition to the difficulty of getting financing, cannabis companies also typically face higher taxes than other similarly sized businesses because they are ineligible for federal tax credits and deductions.",
      "Opening the door for cannabis to operate under the same tax rules that apply to traditional businesses could bring \u201ca lot of responsible capital into the space,\u201d said Kohen.",
      "That is going to \u201cbring a wave of legitimacy to the industry that we all need,\u201d he said.",
      "Not everyone is supportive of a change in the industry\u2019s tax status, however. A Senate bill introduced in February by Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford would prohibit tax deductions and credits for businesses that sell cannabis.",
      "The high cost of SARs",
      "In addition to legal conflicts, collateral questions and tax trouble, there is a fourth factor contributing to banks\u2019 reluctance to serve cannabis businesses: the high cost of complying with federal reporting rules.",
      "As long as the money from cannabis sales could be construed under federal law as the proceeds of a crime, banks that do business with dispensaries must file scores of individual reports, alerting regulators that the transactions might not comply with both federal and state laws.",
      "The reports are called Suspicious Activity Reports, or SARs, and they often require banks to foot the bill for due diligence to verify that the money at issue is not, in fact, furthering a crime.",
      "To service the accounts of cannabis companies, banks also need to monitor their business practices and be on the alert for a unique set of red flags.",
      "For example, \u201cHow does a financial institution, miles away from the dispensary floor, ensure its client is not selling to minors?\u201d asked cannabis banking consultant Peter Su in a recent essay for \u201cRolling Stone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe answer is intensive, ongoing monitoring. This goes far beyond glancing at a business license,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis level of due diligence is unparalleled in standard commercial banking.\u201d",
      "Kohen said he hopes the biggest impact that reclassifying cannabis will have on the industry is one that's \u201cnot seen on the surface.\u201d",
      "\u201c[It's] the beginning of the complete change of the stigma around cannabis,\u201d he said."

The amendment will need to pass the Legislature again next year \u2014 when it will include even more Democrats, thanks to strong showing for the party in November's elections \u2014 before going to voters for final approval.",
      "The process is necessary to bypass Virginia's bipartisan redistricting commission, which voters approved just five years ago.",
      "Assuming that all goes as planned for Democrats in the blue-leaning state, legislative leaders have signaled they could target as many as four Republican seats in a new map.",
      "\u201cOur congressional delegation is 6-5 \u2014 six Democrats, five Republicans. Ten-1 is not out of the realm,\u201d Virginia House Speaker Don Scott said in early December.",
      "Under the current lines, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger carried 8 of the state's 11 congressional districts in the November election.",
      "Virginia lawmakers will need to move quickly. The filing deadline for the primary election is April 2, though that date could be moved to accommodate a new map.",
      "Florida",
      "Florida's Republican-led Legislature is widely expected to pursue a redistricting push next year. But the state Constitution\u2019s ban on partisan gerrymandering and some infighting between Gov. Ron DeSantis and GOP lawmakers are creating some hurdles.",
      "Republicans currently control 20 of Florida's 28 congressional districts, and hope that a new map could allow them to pick up three to five seats.",
      "State House lawmakers have declared their interest in moving quickly, convening a brief committee hearing this month that formally kick-started the process. But DeSantis prefers to wait until the Supreme Court issues a ruling on a case that could erode a key provision of the Voting Rights Act (more on that below) and make the process smoother.",
      "A late-April filing deadline and mid-August primary give Florida Republicans some additional breathing room compared to other states, though those could also be moved.",
      "Kansas",
      "Aside from Florida, Republicans don't have many other clear redistricting targets.",
      "In Kansas, Republicans legislative leaders have said they\u2019ll discuss redrawing the state's map when they reconvene in January, though they tried and failed to bring the issue forward earlier this year.",
      "The issue for Kansas Republicans is they'll need two-thirds support in the Legislature to take up and pass a new map to override a veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins has sought to pressure a group of 10 Republican lawmakers who refused to support a special session on the topic this fall to get on board.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, I\u2019ll be surprised if they even really bring it up,\u201d Kelly said in a recent interview with the Kansas Reflector. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot has changed in terms of where legislators stand on the issue.\u201d",
      "Kansas also has just one Democratic-held district for Republicans to target.",
      "Maryland and Illinois",
      "Similarly, Democrats' redistricting options are limited outside of Virginia. National Democrats have pointed to Maryland and Illinois, but lawmakers there have so far resisted pressure to redraw their maps.",
      "In Maryland, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore formed a redistricting commission last month to explore the issue, who voted behind closed doors last week to move forward with the process. If Democrats were to proceed, the lone GOP target would be Rep. Andy Harris' district.",
      "But after declaring that his chamber would not take up a new map this fall, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson has refused to budge.",
      "\u201cIf we want to protect this democracy in the future, we have got to chart a different path,\u201d Ferguson told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",
      "There's also been little traction in Illinois, where Black lawmakers is particular have expressed fear that a new map would undermine minority representation. Some Democrats hope that could squeeze an extra seat or two out of a state in which they already control 14 of 17 congressional districts.",
      "Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker had previously said Illinois' redistricting efforts would hinge on whether Indiana enacted a new map. He applauded Indiana Republicans' decision to reject the redrawn map while promising to \"remain vigilant against [Trump's] map rigging\" in a post on X.",
      "Another issue in Illinois: The candidate filing deadline already passed in early November.",
      "Missouri",
      "After Missouri Republicans passed a new map in September that carves up Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver\u2019s Kansas City area district, opponents are still fighting to prevent it from being in place for the midterms.",
      "Earlier this month, a Democratic-backed group submitted nearly three times the required signatures to place a referendum on the ballot that seeks to repeal the map",
      "While such a petition is considered, the law in question is typically put on hold in Missouri. But state officials said they won't pause the map until the signatures are verified, which could lead to further legal action.",
      "If the petition is ultimately certified, it would be up to Missouri's Republican-dominated Legislature to determine when it would appear on the ballot.",
      "Looming Supreme Court ruling",
      "The biggest wild card is the Supreme Court, which signaled that it is leaning toward further weakening the Voting Rights Act, which was enacted to protect minority voters, as part of a Louisiana redistricting case.",
      "If the justices ultimately rule that way, and the decision comes early in the year, it could open the floodgates for Republican-led states, particularly in the South, to carve up majority-Black districts represented by Democrats.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed two bills in October to delay the state\u2019s election calendar, a move designed to give lawmakers time to redraw their congressional map if the Supreme Court rules in their favor.",
      "South Carolina Republicans have expressed interest in drawing a new map that unseats the state's only Democrat, Rep. Jim Clyburn, who represents a majority-Black district. And Republicans in Alabama, where Democrats control two districts, could also act.",
      "But if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t issue a ruling until the end of its term in June \u2014 which it often does for major cases \u2014  it would likely mean any new maps that result from it wouldn't go into effect until after the 2026 election."

    "story": [
      "Francis Dominic, a content creator based in Los Angeles, watches episodes of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d the moment they drop on HBO Max. When he saw the fifth episode, he knew he wanted to watch it again \u2014 this time, with a crowd.",
      "\u201cI was like, 'Listen, I have to experience this with people,'\u201d Dominic tells TODAY.com.",
      "Dominic headed to a local gay sports bar that has been airing episodes of the romance novel adaptation since Episode 3, demonstrating the snowball effect the show has had since its Nov. 28 premiere.",
      "In his videos from the evening, the crowd cheers during the last scene as if they were experiencing a live sporting event. Other reactions flooding social media are similarly euphoric, with people saying they're watching it \"like it's the Super Bowl.\"",
      "But why has Episode 5 in particular led to such an outpouring of love? Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "What Is \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019?",
      "Based on Rachel Reid\u2019s \"Game Changers\" romance novel series, two hockey all-stars fall for each other in \u201cHeated Rivalry.\u201d",
      "Situated within a league that has no openly queer players, Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) and Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) feel trapped, especially as their feelings for each other grow.",
      "Full of longing and NSFW scenes, the series has been hailed as a perfect romance novel adaptation by fans and has brought new ones into the fold, hence the crowd at Francis\u2019 local bar.",
      "What Happens in Episode 5 of 'Heated Rivalry'?",
      "Episode 5 continues the dramatic highs and lows of Shane and Ilya. Notable moments include Shane ending his relationship with Rose Landry, Shane getting hurt and taken off the ice on a stretcher with a distraught Ilya looking on, and Ilya confessing he loves Shane (that is, in Russian, a monologue that \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d fans who are native Russian speakers are especially loving.)",
      "But in its final few moments, after four episodes of angst, there's a reprieve, one that fans experienced with joy \u2014\u00a0and documented for social media.",
      "To explain it, we have to go back to Episode 3, which took a detour from Shane and Ilya\u2019s story to focus on another hockey player, New York star Scott Hunter (Francois Arnaud).",
      "While he\u2019s older than Shane and Ilya, who are both in their mid-20s, he's struggling with the same issue. His meet-cute with an aspiring art historian named Kip (Robbie G.K.) led to a real love, but he feels unable to come out. With Kip tired of living under the shadow of a secret romance, they're at a standstill.",
      "Then comes the ending of Episode 5, when Scott\u2019s New York Admirals win the Stanley Cup. As his teammates embrace friends and family on the ice, Scott moves to the edge of the rink and scans the crowd, looking for someone.",
      "Shane and Ilya watch the moment unfold on the TV. That means the fictional characters and the \"Heated Rivalry\" audience experience the shock of what Scott does next: He gestures for Kip to come down to the ice. Then, he kisses him on live TV.",
      "Meanwhile, Shane and Ilya seemingly have their own revelations of what this might mean for their relationship.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ilya calls Shane and takes him up on his offer to spend two weeks alone at his home. For the first time in years, they'll have quality together.",
      "The episode ends with Ilya telling Shane, \u201cI\u2019m coming to the cottage.\u201d",
      "Why Is Episode 5 Such a Big Deal?",
      "While \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has been building momentum since its premiere, Episode 5 has inspired a particular outpouring of emotion.",
      "Ronald Charles Chavis filmed his husband, Refeal Shtivi, weeping after watching the episode in a video shared to TikTok. Speaking to TODAY.com, the couple say the episode\u2019s \u201cgrand gesture\u201d reminded them of their own story. Shtivi was encouraged to come out to the wider world after meeting Chavis in 2023.",
      "\u201cThis coming out part in front of so many people, I did myself. I felt like the big release they were having. I felt super connected with that,\u201d Shtivi says.",
      "\u201cGay, straight \u2014 people want to know that they\u2019re loved,\u201d Chavis adds. \u201cThat was the beauty in that episode.\"",
      "Chavis calls the episode \u201ccathartic\u201d for viewers, especially after the four episodes of build-up.",
      "\u201cIt was such a such a release for them that everybody watching that episode felt it. Because at one point it felt like we were all holding our breath, waiting, and when he did that, it was like it was a sign that everything was going to be OK,\u201d Chavis says.",
      "Dominic points to the widespread pop culture phenomenon of  LGTBQ love stories ending in tragedy. Instead, at the end of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d Episode 5, a gay love story is \u201cloudly celebrated\" as the crowd in the stadium cheers, too.",
      "\u201cWhat was so great about it is that we finally got a huge happily ever after,\u201d Dominic says. \u201cWhen I watched it by myself, I was sobbing, because it\u2019s like we are constantly fighting for our happily ever after.\u201d",
      "For Dominic, Episode 5\u2019s ending is meta, with consequences reverberating both in the show and in the real world.",
      "\u201cI think seeing Scott choose Kip and bringing him on the ice was so triumphant, because sometimes that just never happens either in real life or in media portraits of gays in their relationship,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will be inspired to live the truth that they\u2019ve always wanted to,\" he said. \"If this is what\u2019s happening right now mainstream media, I\u2019m like, why can\u2019t it happen in real life?\u201d"

      "Thanks to the mystery of the algorithm, one of the videos went off. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching this video, you are in group 7,\u201d James said in the 7th video, which amassed 85.6 million views.",
      "What followed was not just a viral moment, but a turning point for James' career, leading to a New York Times profile an in-person group 7 event in Los Angeles.",
      "What comes after group 7? A lot, James says.",
      "Life before and after \u2018group 7\u2019",
      "Before her viral moment, James describes her career as an independent artist as \u201cpretty stagnant.\u201d",
      "She graduated from UCLA with a degree in jazz. \u201cI just knew that I wanted to do music my whole life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI figured if I had a good understanding of jazz theory and practice, I could translate it easily to whatever genre I chose.\u201d",
      "Since college, she has worked all over the music industry, from session pianist to backup vocalist to touring opener and keyboardist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had my hands in about 10 different pies at any given point, with the intention of making the solo artist career full-time,\u201d James says.",
      "As an independent artist, social media was the \"only tool in her arsenal\" for getting her own music out into the world \u2014 but she did not expect her impulsive batch of videos to blow up. She says she was \u201cjust trying things and feeling silly,\u201d so she was shocked when the seventh video took off.",
      "This journey and group 7 have not only changed her goals, but the scale of her audience and the reach of her music. James gained over 100,000 TikTok followers after going viral, according to The New York Times.",
      "The viral moment also helped James catch the attention of SiriusXM\u2019s Mikey Piff, who discovered her song \u201cSo Unfair\u201d through the group 7 video. James explains that Piff emailed her asking to play her on the station.",
      "\u201cI was like, that\u2019s crazy \u2014 I never, ever thought I would ever have a song on the radio,\u201d James says. \u201cI consider that the pinnacle of a music career.\u201d",
      "James says \u201cSo Unfair\u201d then transferred over to the Hits 1 station because of the positive response to the song.",
      "\u201cAnd so that\u2019s been really unbelievable and very massive,\u201d James says.",
      "Still, life after group 7 can come with pressure. James says she has felt some expectations to recreate the viral success, but she knows it was a \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d moment.",
      "\u201cI will never top the group 7 video, at least on social media,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is my magnum opus on social media.\u201d",
      "New year, new music",
      "James says if people want more excitement, they should turn to her music. Instead of chasing another viral hit, James is focused on building her future. She says her upcoming album, to be released in 2026, represents a creative shift.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the most explorative I\u2019ve ever been in music,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s very absurd and playful in a lot of ways, and it\u2019s been really fun to explore that side of artistry.\u201d",
      "James says earlier songs were more \u201cdeeply existential and grim,\u201d where the new album is a lot more \u201cexplosive.\u201d She feels all the feelings, ranging from anger to humor.",
      "\u201cTo be an artist you don\u2019t have to be tortured,\u201d James says. \u201cYou can also be a trickster, you can be playful and excited and angry.\u201d",
      "These feelings in her music are inspired by lived experience, relationships and music she\u2019s listened to across eras. In her mind, these are songs that could be enjoyed and on the radio 15 years ago or 15 years from now.",
      "Much of her upcoming album was shaped by the two years she spent writing it, a period filled with \u201ca lot of living.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have the freedom to dream bigger than I have felt like I was allowed to in a long while,\u201d James says.",

      "But how does the NHL feel about \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d? In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, a league rep said about the hit series, \u201cThere are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL\u2019s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe has a lot of challenges, and we do have great days and some tough days, but in general, he\u2019s very strong. His mobility and cognition have been terrific. So, we\u2019re in a really good place right now,\u201d Isa Bolton, 50, told the AARP in an interview that was published on Dec. 19.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s generally in a really good mood and just like excited for the day,\u201d added Taryn Bolton, 46, in a video accompanying the article.",
      "Michael Bolton learned that he had glioblastoma in December 2023 after undergoing emergency surgery to remove a brain tumor. He had a second brain surgery in January 2024 to treat an infection, then received radiation and chemotherapy.",
      "The Grammy Award-winning singer, who is now 72, told the AARP via email that he\u2019s \u201cfeeling deeply grateful,\u201d but added that \u201cthis past year has tested me in ways I never imagined.\u201d",

      "What Illness Is Michael Bolton Suffering From?",
      "Bolton has glioblastoma, the most common and deadliest type of brain cancer, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. The median survival is nine months from diagnosis, with only 7% of glioblastoma patients living more than five years, it notes.",
      "The cancer is aggressive and difficult to treat because it grows tentacles into the brain rather than forming a solid mass. There is no cure. Uche Ojeh, the husband of TODAY co-host Sheinelle Jones, died of glioblastoma in May 2025. He was 45.",
      "Glioblastoma symptoms include persistent headaches, double vision, changes in mood, memory problems and coordination issues.",

      "Taryn Bolton lives with him full-time in his home in Westport, Connecticut. Isa Bolton is there three days a week, while Holly Bolton, 48, flies in one week each month. Caregiving can leave a person burnt out, sad and lonely, Taryn Bolton said, advising the millions of others in the same situation to take time to take care of themselves, too.",
      "Is Michael Bolton Still Performing?",
      "The singer is no longer performing, but the family has grown closer since Bolton \u2014 who is known for hits such as \u201cSoul Provider\u201d and spent decades traveling the world on concert tours \u2014 was forced to slow down due to his health issues.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been home for two years, recovering,\u201d Isa Bolton told the AARP. \u201cHe\u2019s with one of his children or multiple children and grandchildren for all of his meals. We probably had more meals with him in two years than we have had our entire [lives].\u201d",
      "Bolton said his daughters help him stay centered.",
      "\u201cThey remind me of who I am and what\u2019s worth fighting for,\u201d he told the AARP via email.",
      "The singer also thanked his fans for their messages and prayers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how a few words from someone you\u2019ve never met can lift your spirit and steady your steps. It reminds me that we\u2019re all connected, and none of us walk through life\u2019s challenges alone,\u201d he wrote."

      "Henry\u2019s reaction? \u201cI was in shock, like I cried and laughed,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. His favorite part of the song was \u201cwhen they talked about me liking Swig and 67.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they will ever understand the impact that that had on Henry, and on me,\u201d Hinson says. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t just offer medical care that day. It wasn\u2019t just them doing their jobs. They saw Henry.\u201d",
      "The viral performance came during a particularly challenging time for Henry, who has undergone 25 surgeries related to his condition. The week before Thanksgiving, Henry was hospitalized after going into septic shock and required surgery and time on a ventilator as his body fought infection.",
      "\u201cHis bravery, in my opinion, is unmatched,\u201d Hinson says, her voice catching with emotion. \u201cHe faces a lot of really big, scary things.\u201d",
      "For Henry, Swift\u2019s music serves as more than entertainment, it\u2019s a lifeline during scary moments.",
      "\u201cWhen he is scared, when he has to go to the CT machine or he\u2019s going back into surgery, all somebody has to do is say, \u2018Well, tell me about the time you went to the Eras Tour,' and he\u2019s instantly transported into this place that\u2019s safe and secure and that he understands. It just makes his days inside of this hospital a little bit easier,\" she says.",
      "Henry now watches the video of the performance regularly, and his mom catches him humming his own personalized version of the song.",
      "She tells both her sons \u2014 Henry and his 15-year-old brother, Oliver\u2014 that \u201cjoy is a choice we make every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the hard times, it\u2019s especially important that we choose joy, that we look for joy, because it is what sustains us. And so for Henry, he oozes it. He literally oozes joy,\u201d she says.",
      "The viral attention has inspired Henry and his family to give back. When Hinson told Henry that the TikTok video was starting to earn money through the creator fund, \u201che didn\u2019t miss a beat and he said, \u2018Mom, I think we should donate it back to the hospital. You know, they\u2019re the reason we\u2019re getting it,\u2019\u201d she recalls.",
      "Both Henry and his brother Oliver asked their mom to create an Amazon wish list for the child life team at Riley instead of receiving gifts for themselves for the holidays this year.",
      "\u201cThey both were like, \u2018Mom, we have enough stuff,\u2019\u201d Hinson says. The public wish list includes items like Lip Smackers chapstick, which child life specialists use to coat the inside of anesthesia masks so kids smell strawberry or chocolate instead of a sterile operating room.",
      "\u201cChild life specialists often work with a very limited budget, but the work they do is so incredibly important,\u201d Hinson explains. \u201cI\u2019m just incredibly grateful that the internet gets to see the work that really goes into loving children through critical illness.\u201d"

      "What Is the 'Avatar' Franchise About?",
      "The sci-fi franchise, created by Cameron, tells the story of a group of humans in the antagonistic Resources Development Administration (RDA) who clash with indigenous humanoid called the Na\u2019vi after greedily colonizing their moon Pandora to mine a valuable mineral.",
      "The franchise\u2019s long arc also features an unlikely love story between a human, Jake Sully, played by Worthington, and the Na\u2019vi warrior Neytiri, played by Salda\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d introduces a new oceanic Na\u2019vi tribe, the Metkayina clan, who live on Pandora\u2019s reefs, as well as new sea creatures like the whale-like Tulkuns. In \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d viewers get to meet the Mangkwan clan, also known as the Ash People, who are led by their wicked leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin.",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 4\u2019 Be Released?",
      "The year delay in the release of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d pushed back the release dates of the franchise\u2019s final two movies, Deadline reported in June 2023.",
      "\u201cAvatar 4,\u201d which was originally scheduled for a December 2026 release, will now arrive in theaters in December 2029, according to Deadline.",
      "But, as Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published this week, he hopes the just-released \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d is another box-office smash in order for him to continue with the franchise.",
      "Still, Cameron shared tidbits about the script of \u201cAvatar 4\u201d with Entertainment Weekly way back in 2022, revealing that the movie would feature \u201ca big time jump\u201d to accommodate how much the franchise\u2019s younger actors have aged in real life.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young men, young women at that point, when we get to the B side of that time jump,\u201d he said.",
      "During a 2023 appearance on \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace,\u201d Cameron confirmed he\u2019d already begun working on both final films.",
      "\u201c\u2018Avatar 4\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 are both written. We even have some of \u20184\u2019 in the can,\u201d said Cameron.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve begun a franchise at this point,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can safely say we\u2019ve begun a saga that can now play out over multiple films, which was our original goal.\u201d",
      "When Wallace asked if Cameron already knew the final scene of the entire franchise, Cameron responded, \u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s all been written. The scripts for 2, 3, 4 and 5 were all finished over five years ago. It\u2019s all mapped out.\u201d",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 5\u2019 Be Released?",
      "\u201cAvatar 5,\u201d which was originally intended to arrive in theaters in December 2028, is now set for a December 2031 release, reported Deadline.",
      "How Will the 'Avatar' Story End?",
      "As far as how the franchise\u2019s story will wrap up, producer Jon Landau dropped a bombshell about the plot of \u201cAvatar 5,\u201d during a 2022 conversation with Gizmodo\u2019s io9 blog.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to talk about it, but I\u2019ve now subsequently heard that Jim (Cameron) has talked about it a little bit,\u201d Landau said. \u201cIn movie five there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people\u2019s eyes, open Neytiri\u2019s eyes, to what exists on Earth.\u201d",
      "The journey, said Landau, will illustrate to the Na\u2019vi that the colonizing humans in the Resources Development Administration don\u2019t represent all humans.",
      "\u201cEarth is not just represented by the RDA,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like you\u2019re defined by the choices you make in life, not all humans are bad. Not all Na\u2019vi are good. And that\u2019s the case here on Earth. And we want to expose Neytiri to that.\u201d"

      "In 2023, Kelce attended one of Taylor Swift\u2019s concerts and attempted to give the singer a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it. Alas, he learned that she wasn\u2019t meeting with anyone before or after the show in an effort to conserve her voice for the concert, which lasted over three hours.",

The Ash People are led by their evil leader Varang (Oona Chaplin).",

      "The humans and Quaritch are also on the hunt for Jake, who eventually surrenders to them when his family is in danger and after they have captured Spider. Scientists want to use Spider after he acquires an ability to breathe on Pandora without an oxygen mask, thanks to the mycelium that has invaded his body when Kiri tried to save his life.",
      "An injured, healing and angry Neytiri infiltrates the RDA\u2019s facilities to rescue Jake. She is successful thanks to the help of Spider, who broke out of his cell, and marine biologist Dr. Ian Garvin (Jemaine Clement), who is against the humans killing Tulkun.",
      "Meanwhile, the RDA has big plans to kill dozens of Tulkun, whose brains carry amrita, a substance that stops humans from aging. After meeting the Ash People earlier in the film, Quaritch goes to Varang to ask for help in defeating Jake and the other Na\u2019vi in exchange for firearms and machinery. The Ash People come in handy when the big war rages.",
      "When they get back to the Metkayina clan, Jake rallies up as many Na\u2019vi to fight and save their people and all the innocent Tulkun. In the process, many get injured and Jake and Neytiri\u2019s children \u2014 Lo\u2019ak, Kirk, Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss) \u2014 as well as Spider, take matters into their own hands.",
      "During the fight, pregnant Ronal (Kate Winslet) dies, but not before delivering her baby and asking Neytiri to take care of her baby girl.",
      "Kiri, with the help of Spider and Tuk, successfully gets Eywa to help and fight against the RDA. Other casualties include Scoresby (Brendan Cowell), who is killed by a Tulkun, and General Ardmore (Edie Falco).",
      "Jake \u2014 who has been fighting alongside the Great Leonopteryx, the dragon-like warrior \u2014 then gets into a one-on-one battle with Quaritch on the floating islands. At one point, Spider is thrown into the middle of their fight. He slips and is at risk of falling to his death. Quaritch attempts to save him but also puts himself in danger \u2014 and Jake helps save them both. The encounter seems to draw them all to a truce.",
      "When Neytiri, her children and Tsireya (Bailey Bass) arrive to help defeat Quaritch, Jake tells them to stop. However, Quaritch jumps off the floating island and into an inferno below. It sure doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d survive that, but \u201cAvatar\u201d fans know that guy has a thousand lives.",
      "As the movie comes to an end, one of the final scenes shows Kiri guiding Spider into the spirit world where they reunite with Neteyam, as well as Dr. Grace Augustine (Weaver), Kiri\u2019s biological mother.",

    "story": [
      "A pair of deadly attacks this month, in Syria and Australia, has shone a fresh spotlight on the Islamic State, the militant group whose sudden rise to power in the Middle East and reign of terror throughout the world had appeared to crest, and then fall, during the 2010s.",
      "But for experts who study ISIS, law enforcement and intelligence officials who fight it and the growing number of victims who have been attacked or intimidated, the group has long been more down than out \u2013 a diminished threat, but a threat nonetheless.",
      "\u201cThey never went away,\u201d said Aaron Zelin, an expert on the group and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe nature of the threat just changed and the nature of the way they organized themselves changed. But what\u2019s animated the Islamic State has never changed.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, a member of Syria\u2019s security forces shot dead three Americans -- two soldiers and an interpreter -- near the city of Palmyra. The Islamic State didn\u2019t claim responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. and Syrian governments both blamed the terrorist group.",
      "The U.S. military launched strikes against Islamic State infrastructure and weapons sites in Syria in retaliation for the attack, officials said Friday.",
      "\u201cWe are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,\u201d President Donald Trump  said Friday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In Sydney, two men opened fire on a Hanukkah gathering at  Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing at least 15 people. Both men were shot by police. One man died; the other, the man\u2019s son, survived and has been charged in the attack. Islamic State social media accounts traditionally linked to the group praised the attack but did not officially claim responsibility, referring to it  in an official publication as \"Sydney's pride.\" The two suspects were found with Islamic State flags and literature.",
      "While the two incidents were notable for their geographic spread, the identities of those killed and a perception that the Islamic State had faded from global headlines, experts say they were exceptions that belie a measurable metric: ISIS is getting weaker, and arrests and attacks have been declining globally.",
      "\u201cThere will always be some space for attacks here and there. But the trajectory is that ISIS is still on the decline,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cAnyone who has a grievance and finds a network can basically attack, and in many cases the central ISIS leaders don\u2019t know it happens until it happens, and then they claim it.\u201d",
      "The group has claimed 1,100 attacks so far in 2025, he said, down from a high of 3,460 in 2019.",
      "There have been 383 ISIS-related arrests worldwide so far in 2025, Zelin said, citing the Washington Institute\u2019s Islamic State Select Worldwide Activity Map, an initiative he leads. Reporting from police sources found 531 such arrests last year, Zelin said, the vast majority of which occurred in active war zones such as Iraq and Syria.",
      "One thing the recent attacks showcase is a strategy that has made the Islamic State effective in the past: its big-tent approach to operations and ideology that allow \u201clone-wolf\u201d actors to affiliate themselves with ISIS with almost no vetting or coordination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing more of and more of the hallmarks of ISIS-related activity that date back 10 years ago,\u201d Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, told NBC News. \u201cThe do-it-yourself model was professionalized and has been really deployed around the world by ISIS, inspiring dozens of people to carry out attacks in their name.\u201d",
      "The Islamic State emerged from the ferment of Syria\u2019s civil war in the early 2010s, when Syria\u2019s porous borders and surfeit of Islamist fighters offered fertile recruiting ground for all manner of jihadi groups. But ISIS  distinguished itself by forming a self-governing state encompassing parts of Syria and Iraq that promised a return to the political expansionism of early Islam.",
      "Though defeated, that \u201ccaliphate\u201d has remained a central part of the Islamic State\u2019s message, even as the group has shifted its focus more toward terrorism than nation-building.",
      "The two suspects in the Bondi Beach shooting are known to have visited the Philippines before the attack. If investigators find that the two men underwent ISIS commando training in southern Mindanao island, that could point to a level of centralized coordination that investigators haven\u2019t seen from ISIS in years.",
      "The group\u2019s activities over the past year have also shown an enduring, if dampened, public appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, Polish authorities said they had arrested a teenager who they said had sought contact with the group and whom they suspected of planning an attack on a Christmas market.",
      "In Michigan in October, two men were charged with plotting a mass shooting over Halloween weekend.",
      "And almost a year ago, an ISIS-inspired American Muslim killed 14 people by driving a truck into New Year\u2019s revelers in New Orleans.",
      "The Islamic State has still been unable to reconstitute its so-called caliphate, a vast Islamist emirate the group ruled across parts of Iraq and Syria until it was finally destroyed in 2019. In both countries, Islamic State attacks reached historic lows in the past year.",
      "Where the group has made strides and managed to constitute some territory is in the Sahel region of northwest sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 countries like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "The Islamic State\u2019s presence in the remote, arid and sparsely populated parts of Africa may still feel more like merely surviving than thriving to the group\u2019s members and potential recruits.",
      "\u201cEven though they\u2019re active in several African countries, it doesn\u2019t have the same kind of ideological reverence because there is so much history in the Arab world related to Islam,\u201d said Zelin.",
      "And while the Sydney terror attack was lethally successful, many of the Islamic State\u2019s attacks have been thwarted by law enforcement as multinational counterterrorism sharing has grown far stronger.",
      "While observers have said it\u2019s too early to say the recent attacks amount to a resurgence of the group, two relatively recent changes could help revive its fortunes. The fall of Bashar al Assad\u2019s regime in Syria a year ago revived the country\u2019s chaos, offering a wider opening for Islamic State.",
      "When Syrian President Ahmed Al Sharaa \u2014 himself a former Islamist militant who once led a like-minded Al Qaeda offshoot group \u2014 joined the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS last month, it painted a target on the Syrian government\u2019s back.",
      "Even before that, an Islamic State-claimed attack on a church in Damascus that killed at least 25 people in June once again jolted Syrian authorities\u2019 attention to Islamic State\u2019s threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the group\u2019s messaging has exploited Israel\u2019s highly lethal war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip as a rallying cry for attacks against the West. Palestinian health officials say over 70,000 people have been killed in the war.",
      "\u201cI think the temperature has been turned up by the conflict in Gaza over the past two years,\u201d said Colin P. Clarke, the executive director of the Soufan Center, a New York-based security think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s brought in a larger swath of people who are now kind of consuming information that leads them pretty quickly through social media algorithms to extreme content.\u201d",
      "As much of the world gathers for the end-of-year religious holidays,  Islamic State commandos \u2014 whether self-annointed or directed by its leadership \u2014 are taking notice as well.",
      "The group has targeted religious festivities in the past, and analysts warned that another spectacular assault against Christian, Jewish or Muslim targets could give the Islamic State the publicity boost it needs for a more deadly and influential 2026.",
      "\u201cThese are big times when they might try to do stuff,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf they can do stuff again quickly, that would be monumental for them, because they haven\u2019t been able to do stuff like that in years.\u201d"

      "Decades before this week\u2019s manhunt through New England ended with the discovery of his body in a storage facility, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente had been an academic powerhouse in his home country of Portugal. Enrolled at one of the country\u2019s most prestigious engineering schools, Neves Valente graduated at the top of his class, seemingly poised for a bright future.",
      "Now, Neves Valente is dead at age 48, suspected of committing two shocking acts of violence \u2014 and authorities in both the United States and Portugal are looking for a motive that could explain his actions.",
      "Officials believe Neves Valente was behind a mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine other people on Saturday at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is also suspected of fatally shooting 47-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro at Loureiro\u2019s home in the Boston suburb of Brookline on Monday.",
      "The shootings gripped residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts as days passed without anyone in custody. Then on Thursday, authorities announced they had closed in on a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, where they found Neves Valente\u2019s body, who appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Little is known about how he chose his targets, though Neves Valente has past connections to Brown and to Loureiro.",
      "A Providence police affidavit says that Neves Valente came to the U.S. to attend Brown University from August 2000 to spring 2001 on a student visa in the physics Ph.D. program. He requested a leave of absence from the school in 2001, and ultimately withdrew in 2003, the affidavit said.",
      "Neves Valente did not obtain a degree during his time there, Brown\u2019s president said in an email, and he did not have a current affiliation with the university. The email said that during his three semesters at Brown, Neves Valente most likely would have spent time in Barus & Holley, the building where Saturday\u2019s massacre occurred.",
      "Scott Watson told NBC News that he attended Brown with Neves Valente and had been his only friend there. He said Neves Valente was socially awkward and would often complain about Brown.",
      "\u201cHe would say the classes were too easy \u2014 honestly, for him they were,\u201d Watson wrote in an email. \u201cHe already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe could be kind and gentle, though he often became frustrated \u2014 sometimes angry \u2014 about courses, professors, and living conditions,\u201d Watson wrote.",
      "Watson recalled a conflict that Neves Valente had with another student whom he said Neves Valente would refer to as a \"slave\" because the student was from Brazil.",
      "\"I had to break up a fight once,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to that time, both Neves Valente and Loureiro, the MIT professor, attended the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, according to the school, which said that they were enrolled from 1995 to 2000 in the undergraduate program in technological physics engineering. Rog\u00e9rio Cola\u00e7o, the president of Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso that Neves Valente graduated with a final average grade of 19 out of 20 \u2014 an exceptionally high score, particularly given how rigorous the university is.",
      "Even before starting college, Neves Valente had made a strong impression academically. He represented Portugal at the 1995 International Physics Olympiad for secondary school students, in Canberra, Australia, a news clip from the science publication Gazeta da F\u00edsica shows.",
      "Yet Neves Valente seemed to have left little imprint on those he studied with.",
      "\u201cMost classmates have no memory of Cl\u00e1udio Valente, other than the fact that he was the top student in the program that year,\u201d Cola\u00e7o told Expresso.",
      "Loureiro, meanwhile, was a researcher at the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico's plasmas and nuclear fusion unit and was described in a statement from the school as a \"brilliant colleague.\"",
      "\"His friends and colleagues at IPFN and at T\u00e9cnico, some of whom continued to collaborate with Nuno to this day, are deeply distressed by his premature passing,\" the statement said. \"We remember a brilliant colleague, with whom it was a scientific and personal pleasure to collaborate.\"",
      "Alex Schekochihin, a longtime friend and colleague of Loureiro's, said in an email that it was difficult to find anyone who did not like Loureiro.",
      "\"He was a fantastic physicist, a very effective leader with a clear vision and sophisticated sense of strategy, and an amazing human being,\" he wrote.",
      "What Neves Valente accomplished personally or professionally after graduation is not as clear.",
      "Loureiro was a widely known figure \"to anyone who follows the field,\u201d said Carlos Fiolhais, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of Coimbra. \"Valente was a physicist by training, not a researcher, with no known published articles. ... This is aberrant. It is deeply disturbing for the scientific community.\u201d",
      "The Providence police affidavit said that Neves Valente obtained legal permanent resident status in 2017. Public records show he lived in Las Vegas that year and, more recently, appeared to reside in Miami. He had rented a hotel room in Boston twice in late November, an FBI agent wrote in a separate affidavit.",
      "A tipster on the chat forum Reddit led authorities to track down Neves Valente after the shootings. The Portuguese Criminal Police, Portugal\u2019s investigative force, said it was cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation.",
      "The Brown University students killed in Saturday\u2019s attack were identified as Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and Ella Cook. Umurzokov, from Uzbekistan, was remembered by his aunt as kind and smart; Cook, from Birmingham, Alabama, had been the vice president of Brown\u2019s college Republicans group and was described by her church as an \u201cincredible, grounded, faithful, bright light.\u201d",
      "Loureiro had been a world-renowned plasma physicist and fusion scientist who joined MIT in 2016. In a video posted to YouTube earlier this year, Loureiro spoke about his work and offered advice to students in his field.",
      "\u201cI think on any given day, it\u2019s tempting to go for the low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cBe a little more ambitious and tackle the really hard problems.\u201d"

      "\"Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,\" Alfonsi wrote in the note.",
      "\"It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,\" she said in the note.",
      "Alfonsi said her team had requested comment on her reporting from the White House, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security.",

      "Alfonsi did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment Monday.",
      "The furor over the segment was the latest in a string of controversies for CBS and its parent company, the newly formed Paramount Skydance.",
      "President Donald Trump last year sued Paramount, accusing \"60 Minutes\" of having deceptively edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS denied the claim. Paramount settled Trump's lawsuit for $16 million.",
      "Skydance chief David Ellison has sought to reshape the news business, appointing Weiss \u2014 a television newcomer and prominent critic of the traditional news media \u2014 as top editor after he acquired her news and opinion outlet, The Free Press.",
      "In seeking federal approval of the merger with Paramount, Skydance vowed to embrace \"diverse viewpoints\" and represent \"the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.\" He also pledged to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and install an ombudsman at CBS News.",
      "Ellison is separately making a hostile bid to acquire the media giant Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN. Warner Bros. Discovery has already accepted an offer from Netflix in a deal valued at $82.7 billion. Both transactions would require approval from federal regulators.",
      "Trump has close ties to Ellison's father, billionaire technology mogul Larry Ellison, though in recent weeks he has publicly expressed frustration with the direction of \"60 Minutes\" under Paramount's new corporate leadership.",
      "\"For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,\" Trump said Dec. 16 on Truth Social. \"If they are friends, I\u2019d hate to see my enemies!\"",
      "CBS News' decision to hold the \"60 Minutes\" story drew criticism from some Democratic officials.",

      "Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said on X, \"What is happening to CBS is a terrible embarrassment and if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson.\"",

      "Thousands turned out for a memorial Sunday, one week after the Bondi Beach mass shooting shook Australia, as officials announced a review of the country's law enforcement and intelligence agencies.",
      "The attack \u2014 Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades \u2014 killed 15 people during a seaside Hanukkah celebration and was designated a terrorist attack targeting the Jewish community. One suspect was killed during the attack, while the other was injured and charged with terrorism and murder after he awoke from a coma, as Australian investigators probe their alleged connection to the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "A minute of silence was observed at 6:47 p.m. local time (2:47 a.m. E.T.) Sunday, exactly seven days since the attack began. A candle projection lit up Sydney Opera House, while crowds of mourners attended an evening memorial at Bondi, guarded by a heavy police presence, including snipers on rooftops and police boats in the waters.",
      "David Ossip, the president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, told the crowd: \"Like the grass here at Bondi was stained with blood, so, too, has our nation been stained. We have landed up in a dark place.\"",
      "But he pointed to the heroism of Ahmed al-Ahmed, a Syrian Australian fruit shop owner who disarmed one of the shooters, adding that \"a single act of courage, a single flame of hope, can give us direction and point the path forward.\"",
      "Ossip read a message to the crowd from al-Ahmed, who is recovering in the hospital from multiple gunshot wounds. In his message, al-Ahmed said: \"The Lord is close to the broken-hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters.\"",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was at the memorial, as was Governor-General Sam Mostyn, King Charles' representative in Australia. Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard was photographed embracing mourners in the crowd.",
      "The shooting has left Australians across the country reeling, with tributes accompanied by a reckoning over the government\u2019s response to growing antisemitism and the availability of guns in the country.",
      "Albanese was booed as he arrived Sunday night. Leaders in Australia\u2019s Jewish community and some of the victims\u2019 families have blamed the Australian government for missing the signs of growing antisemitism in the wake of the war between Hamas and Israel that erupted in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on an Israeli music festival and accused it of not doing enough to protect the country\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "On Sunday, Albanese commissioned a review of Australia\u2019s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to examine whether they have the \u201cright powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe\u201d in the wake of the attack.",
      "\u201cThe ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation,\u201d his statement said. \u201cOur security agencies must be in the best position to respond.\u201d The review is to be completed by April, he said.",
      "State authorities in New South Wales have moved to tighten restrictions on pro-Palestinian protests and hate speech, with NSW Premier Chris Minns saying protests were \"unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain.\"",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, the surviving suspect, was charged with 59 offenses Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50.",
      "Two \u201chomemade\u201d Islamic State flags were found in the younger suspect\u2019s car, police said last week, adding that the pair traveled last month to the Philippines \u2014 seen in the past as a hot spot for Islamic extremists.",
      "In its weekly Al-Naba magazine bulletin, the Islamic State praised the attack, describing it as a \u201csource of pride,\u201d though it did not directly claim responsibility.",
      "Naveed Akram came to the attention of Australia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in 2019, Albanese said last week, and he was probed for six months over his alleged extremist associations, but it was determined that he posed no threat.",
      "Albanese also called to toughen up the country\u2019s already strict gun laws immediately after the attack and said Friday Australia would launch a national gun buyback scheme."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Authorities in Britain and Australia are tightening restrictions on pro-Palestinians protests in response to the Islamic State-inspired Bondi Beach massacre targeting a Jewish gathering that killed 15 people.",
      "In New South Wales, the Australian state where the deadly attack on a Hanukkah celebration took place, police will be granted expanded powers to shut down unauthorized protests, while tougher hate speech laws will be introduced, including a proposed ban on the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada.\u201d",
      "The move comes shortly after U.K. police arrested two people in London on racially aggravated public order charges for allegedly shouting slogans invoking \u201cintifada\u201d at a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The new restrictions are part of a nationwide policing shift in response to the attack, which has drawn concern from some civil liberties and free-speech advocates.",
      "The Arabic word \"intifada\" is generally translated as \"uprising\" and is used to describe two major Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli occupation, the first beginning in 1987 and the second in 2000, both characterized by periods of violence as well as nonviolent mass protests.",
      "Supporters say the term \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d which has been used for years at pro-Palestinian protests worldwide, refers to international solidarity against Israeli occupation.",
      "Israeli officials and some Jewish organizations, however, argue the term carries an inherent call to violence against Israel and that it functions as antisemitic incitement, a dispute that has increasingly led to policing decisions.",
      "NSW Premier Chris Minns said Thursday that the \u201cimplications\u201d of pro-Palestinian rallies could be seen in the Bondi attack and, after authorities designated the shooting a terrorist event, he has introduced reforms that would give his government powers to shut down unauthorized protests for three months.",
      "\u201cWhen you see people marching and showing violent bloody images, images of death and destruction, it\u2019s unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain,\u201d he said.",
      "Minns on Saturday announced further reforms to hate speech laws that would ban the \"globalize the intifada\" chant alongside other \u201chateful comments and statements,\u201d as well as \u201cterrorist symbols such as the ISIS flags.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday officers would arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d directly citing the context of the attack. A rabbi and a Holocaust survivor were among those killed in the Sydney terror attack, which officials said was intended to directly target the Jewish community.",
      "In a joint statement after the attack, London and Manchester's law enforcement agencies said: \u201cViolent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\u201d",
      "The British police forces also referenced an attack at a synagogue in Manchester earlier this year, where two people were killed on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.",
      "Hundreds of people, many of them elderly, according to British Home Office data, have already been arrested at protests in recent months across the U.K. for showing support for Palestine Action, a group that was banned under British terrorism laws after staging actions targeting military facilities and defense firms. The British government said, without providing evidence, that the group had shown willingness \"to use violence in pursuit of its cause.\"",
      "While major Jewish groups have welcomed last week's changes and proposals in the U.K. and Australia, some analysts and opponents of the new measures warn that governments are responding to security fears by collapsing political speech into criminal conduct.",
      "Index on Censorship, a U.K.-based organization advocating for free expression, said police and prosecutors will need to demonstrate that the words \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d are \u201charmful in and of themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere meaning is genuinely ambiguous, we always argue that the criminal law should tread carefully,\u201d it said in a statement Friday.",
      "Marji Mansfield, 69, a retired financial consultant and grandmother of seven, was carried away in handcuffs by police officers at demonstrations in July and November in London, and faces terrorism charges for expressing support for Palestine Action.",
      "She said she hasn't heard 'globalize the intifada' chanted at rallies, but denied the slogan was an incitement to violence, calling it \"a call for liberation\" amid Israel's ongoing occupation of Gaza.",
      "\"It seems bizarre that our government and the government in Australia are seeking to criminalize words that are saying, 'stop these illegal international crimes against humanity',\" she told NBC News.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, warned in July that some measures in the U.K. limiting pro-Palestinian protests appear \"at odds with the U.K.\u2019s obligations under international human rights law.\"",
      "Freedom of expression \u201chas always been vital, but it\u2019s never been absolute,\" said Mark Stephens, co-chair of the International Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Institute. \"We've always drawn a line at incitement to violence, and so that principle has to adapt in more volatile climates.\"",
      "The difficulty authorities face, Stephens told NBC News, is that they are taking slogans and criminalizing them \"on the grounds that it threatens public safety and the state has a duty to act, but that is an area where reasonable people can and do differ.\"",
      "From a police perspective \"it's becoming a bit of a game of Whac-A-Mole,\" he added. \"If you can't say 'globalize the intifada,' someone will come up with something else which isn't illegal, and that becomes the new phrase du jour.\"",
      "In Australia, the additional legislation on protests has also sparked debate over how far authorities should go in policing political expression.",
      "\u201cFor two years, people have paraded in our streets and universities calling for the intifada to be globalized, a catchphrase which means kill Jews wherever you find them,\" David Ossip, the president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said last week.",
      "Some Jewish groups have opposed the move. The Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \"Palestinian freedom,\" said Thursday in a statement that \"policy which points towards universities, the protest movement and migration as the problem will only lead to more demonization.\"",
      "Australian authorities charged the surviving suspect in the Bondi Beach shooting with 59 offenses on Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder.",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, was charged after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50."

      "\"We are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,\" he said in the post.",
      "The goal of the operation was to hit places where ISIS is trying to reconstitute and to root out those forces and destroy their locations on a large scale, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The U.S. military used A-10s, F-16s, Apache helicopters and HIMARS while Jordanian F-16s also provided support, the official said.",
      "The strikes are expected to last several weeks or up to a month, according to two U.S. officials.",

      "Three other U.S. personnel were wounded in the Dec. 13 attack in Palmyra, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesperson, said on X last Saturday. The soldiers \u201cwere conducting a key leader engagement\u201d in \u201csupport of ongoing counter-ISIS operations,\u201d he said.",
      "The two soldiers killed in Syria last Saturday were Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa, according to the U.S. Army. Both were members of the Iowa National Guard. Ayad Mansoor Sakat, of Macomb, Michigan, a U.S. civilian working as an interpreter, was also killed.",
      "The shooting that took place near the historic city of Palmyra also wounded three U.S. personnel and members of Syria\u2019s security forces, before the gunman was killed. The assailant had joined Syria\u2019s internal security forces as a base security guard two months ago and recently was reassigned because of suspicions that he might be affiliated with ISIS, Interior Ministry spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba has said."

      "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is leaving the possibility of a war with Venezuela on the table.",
      "\"I don\u2019t rule it out, no,\" he told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "Trump on Tuesday ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers coming and going from Venezuela, increasing pressure on the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The U.S. recently seized an oil tanker captured near Venezuela, as well.",
      "The administration\u2019s campaign has already resulted in 28 boat strikes that have killed more than 100 people, including a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike facing congressional scrutiny.",
      "In his phone interview, Trump said \"I don't discuss it\" when he is asked whether he rules out the possibility that such actions could lead to war.",
      "But when he was pressed, he confirmed it was a possibility and said there will be additional seizures of oil tankers. Asked for a timeline, Trump replied: \"It depends. If they\u2019re foolish enough to be sailing along, they\u2019ll be sailing along back into one of our harbors.\"",
      "Trump also declined to say whether ousting Maduro was his ultimate goal.",
      "\"He knows exactly what I want,\" Trump replied. \"He knows better than anybody.\"",
      "Trump's admission that he's not ruling out a war with Venezuela is significant. He has long tried to distinguish himself from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party, and in 2024, he campaigned on being able to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.",
      "In his speech after he won the election, Trump said he was \"not going to start a war; I\u2019m going to stop wars.\"",
      "The administration has claimed that the strikes have been on alleged drug boats and that Venezuela is using oil revenue to finance \"drug terrorism.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Trump sought to defend his economic policies in a national prime-time address as voters continue to indicate that they're struggling with the cost of living.",
      "In the speech, Trump announced a $1,776 \u201cwarrior dividend\u201d that will go to nearly 1.5 million members of the military in honor of the nation\u2019s founding almost 250 years ago.",
      "Trump told NBC News that people would start getting the payments \"very soon\" \u2014 \"I would say within the next few days, it\u2019ll all be out\" \u2014\u00a0and said they will be funded through the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" and revenue from tariffs.",
      "\"We're making so much money with tariffs that we are able to do that and have plenty left over,\" he said.",
      "A senior administration official said the one-time bonus for troops will cost about $2.6 billion and be paid drawing from military housing funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill. The legislation, which Trump signed in July, allocated $2.9 billion to reduce the out-of-pocket cost for service members for two years.",
      "A Senate appropriations source also said that the money will come from there, not tariffs, and that the Defense Department decided instead to give the money as a one-time payment instead of creating a precedent for housing costs down the line.",
      "Trump also touched on health care in his remarks Wednesday night, blasting \"gigantic health insurance companies that have gotten rich on billions of dollars of money that should go directly to the people.\"",
      "He said people should be able to \"buy their own health insurance, which will give far better benefits at much lower cost. It will be far better health insurance.\"",
      "Millions of people who get coverage through the Affordable Care Act are set to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket next year, after House Republicans refused to call a vote this week to extend the subsidies.",
      "Trump said he doesn't believe it's necessary to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",
      "\"I don\u2019t have to do anything, because Obamacare would just repeal itself automatically because nobody\u2019s going to want to use it. Too expensive,\" he told NBC News.",
      "He also said he has no plans to announce a broader health care plan.",
      "\"As far as I\u2019m concerned, I rolled it out last night,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s a very simple plan. The insurance companies have become totally rich and beyond any comprehension. They get billions and billions of dollars a year, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to pay the money directly to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can use health care accounts. They can use \u2014 you know, there are many ways of doing it, but we\u2019re going to let them buy their own health care. They\u2019ll get much better health care at a much lower price.\"",
      "A central focus for both parties next year will be November's midterm elections, with the Republicans cognizant that losing control of either chamber of Congress could lead to investigations and headaches for the White House.",
