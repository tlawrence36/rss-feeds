      "Acclaimed dancer become Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater artistic director.",
      "NEW YORK -- Judith Jamison, an internationally acclaimed dancer who later served as artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater for two decades, has died. She was 81.",
      "Jamison died Saturday after a brief illness in New York, surrounded by close friends, Ailey company spokesperson Christopher Zunner confirmed to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cWe remember and are grateful for her artistry, humanity and incredible light, which inspired us all,\u201d Zunner said.",
      "Jamison grew up in Philadelphia and trained there in ballet from a young age. At a time when Black dancers were rare in ballet, she began with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1965.",
      "Tall, graceful and expressive, she became one of the company's most famous performers and a muse for Ailey. Jamison had star turns in two of Ailey's signature dances, \u201cRevelations\u201d and \u201cCry.\u201d She danced with the Ailey company for 15 years before leaving to perform on Broadway and as a guest artist with other ballet companies.",
      "Jamison later returned to the Ailey company as its artistic director for 20 years. She is widely credited with helping to make it one of the most successful dance companies in the U.S.",
      "As a dancer, choreographer, director and speaker, her distinguished career leaped over barriers of race and gender.",
      "\u201cShe was a unique, spectacular dancer who was majestic and queenly. She danced with eloquence and integrity,\u201d Sylvia Waters, Ailey II Artistic Director Emerita, said Saturday following the new of Jamison's death.",
      "\u201cTo dance with her and to be in her sphere of energy was mesmerizing,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI was fortunate to perform with her and she set the bar very, very high.\u201d",
      "Jamison's directorship of the Ailey theater \u201csustained the company and helped it to grow. She was an eloquent speaker, strong leader and ran a tight ship,\" Waters said.",
      "Striking images of Jamison including photos, video and a sculpture are currently displayed at an exhibition about the work of the Ailey company at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.",
      "Jamison was awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in 1999. Other honors included the National Medal of Arts and the Handel Medallion, the highest cultural award from New York City.",

      "\u201cSaturday Night Live\" will be heading in a new direction as it looks toward a second term for Donald Trump in its first post-election episode",
      "\u201cSaturday Night Live\" is likely to strike a new tone as it looks toward a second term for Donald Trump in its first episode since his election victory.",
      "Standup comic and actor Bill Burr will host for the second time with Mk.gee as musical guest.",
      "But most eyes will be on the NBC sketch institution's cold open, and the signal it gives about what four more years will mean for the generally liberal-leaning show, other than steady employment for cast member James Austin Johnson, who does a Trump impression that has become definitive.",
      "In the first five episodes of its 50th season, which has seen a ratings spike, the show openings made Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 played by returning cast member Maya Rudolph \u2014 the central star, culminating last week in an appearance by Harris herself, with a giddy pre-election energy in the air.",
      "This Saturday night could be a little less live.",
      "After Trump's first election victory in 2016, Kate McKinnon, who played Hillary Clinton on the show, appeared as the losing candidate sitting at the piano and sang an almost entirely somber-and-serious version of Leonard Cohen's \u201cHallelujah,\u201d changing only one verse from the best-known versions of the song.",
      "\u201cAnd even though it all went wrong, I'll stand before the lord of song with nothing on my tongue but \u2018Hallelujah,\u201d McKinnon sang in what became a national moment of catharsis for those on the losing side.",
      "After finishing, McKinnon said, with a shaky voice, \u201cI'm not giving up and neither should you\" before delivering the obligatory \"live from New York, it's Saturday night!\"",
      "Standup comic Dave Chappelle hosted that episode. One sketch featured him and another Black comic-actor, Chris Rock, watching election returns with white liberals, who are shocked by the results, unlike their Black guests.",
      "\u201cThis is the most shameful thing America has ever done,\u201d white cast member Beck Bennett says at the end. Rock and Chappelle then look at each other and break into laughter.",
      "Chappelle also hosted the post-election \u201cSNL\u201d in 2020, but this time that honor goes to another comic, Burr, who is currently on a major standup tour and is set to join Kieran Culkin and Bob Odenkirk on Broadway this spring on a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross,\u201d",
      "Burr's politics, at least as expressed through his comedy and frequent guesting on podcasts and talk shows, may be best described as angrily centrist. But other than the fake news of \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d the show tends to turn away from politics after the opening."

      "Todd died Wednesday at his home in the Los Angeles area, his manager Jeffrey Goldberg said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI had the privilege to have Tony as my friend and client for over 30 years and I will miss that amazing man every single day,\u201d Goldberg said.",
      "\u201cKnown worldwide for his towering presence, both physically and artistically, Tony leaves behind an indelible legacy in film, theater, and the hearts of those who had the honor of knowing him,\" Goldberg's management company said in announcing the death.",

She leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. That makes her the most nominated artist in Grammy history.",
      "\u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is up for album and country album of the year, and \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d is nominated for record, song and country song of the year. She also received nominations in a wide swath of genres, including pop, country, Americana and melodic rap performance categories.",
      "This is her first time receiving nominations in the country and Americana categories. Previously, she and her husband Jay-Z were tied for most career nominations, at 88.",
      "If Beyonc\u00e9 wins the album of the year, she\u2019ll become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Lauryn Hill last won in 1999 for \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\u201d joining Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston as the only Black women to take home the Grammys\u2019 top prize.",
      "Post Malone also received his first ever nominations in the country categories this year, having released his debut country album \u201cF-1 Trillion\" in August. That one is up for country album and \u201cI Had Some Help,\u201d his collaboration with Morgan Wallen, is nominated for country song and country duo/group performance. They are Wallen\u2019s first ever Grammy nominations.",
      "Malone is just behind Beyonc\u00e9, with seven nominations, tied with Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Charli XCX, who earned her first nominations as a solo artist.",
      "Lamar\u2019s ubiquitous diss track released during his feud with Drake, \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d is nominated for record and song of the year, rap song, music video as well as best rap performance. He has two simultaneous entries in the latter category, a career first: Future & Metro Boomin featuring Lamar, \u201cLike That\u201d is up for best rap performance and best rap song.",
      "This is his third time receiving two simultaneous nominations for best rap song.",
      "Taylor Swift and first-time nominees Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan boast of six nominations each.",
      "Last year, women artists dominated the major categories. This year, that continues somewhat, but the main trend seems to be a variance of genre. In the album of the year category, alongside \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is Andr\u00e9 3000\u2019s new age, alt-jazz \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d and multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier\u2019s \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d Rising pop stars Carpenter and Roan round it out, with \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d respectively, as well as Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d and Charli XCX\u2019s rave-ready \u201cBRAT.\u201d",
      "Eilish is the only artist to have her first three albums become nominated for album of the year.",
      "Last year, Swift won album of the year for \u201cMidnights,\u201d breaking the record for most wins in the category with four. This year, she becomes the first ever woman to seven career nominations in the category.",
      "\u201cThe breadth and the variety of genres represented in the general field feels new and really exciting,\u201d says the Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. He credits an active and evolving voting body for its success. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very intentional in how we looked at and tried to rebalance our membership. So not just gender or people of color, different racial makeup, but also genre equity and trying to make sure that all different types of music in different regions and different locations are being represented in every way possible.\u201d",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 were eligible for nominations. The final round of Grammy voting, which determines its winners, will take place Dec. 12 through January 3.",
      "In the best new artist category, Carpenter and Roan will go head-to-head, alongside Benson Boone, Doechii, Khruangbin, RAYE, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims.",
      "In the song of the year category, Beyonc\u00e9 is joined by Eilish with \u201cBirds of a Feather,\u201d Swift and Post Malone with \u201cFortnight,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cDie With A Smile,\u201d and Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy).\u201d",
      "Shaboozey is also a first-time nominee. His \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d is the biggest song of the year, having spent more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 than any other \u2014 it is so popular, a remix of the track is also up for remixed recording.",
      "Elsewhere, Shaboozey is nominated in the melodic rap performance category for his feature on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially-successful Black woman musician in country, is also featured on the song, delivering the 83-year-old artist her first Grammy nomination.",
      "For record of the year, \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d will compete against Swift and Post Malone\u2019s \u201cFortnight,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cBirds of a Father,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso,\u201d Charli XCX\u2019s \u201c360,\u201d and the Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re keeping up with how music creators and our community are using technology. And in this case, AI enhanced the record and allowed it to be eligible in the categories that it was eligible in,\u201d Mason jr explains.",
      "Dolly Parton scored her 55th career nomination in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category for her \u201cBehind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones,\u201d news The Associated Press broke to the country music legend Friday morning. \u201cNo! What did I get nominated for?\u201d she cheered over the phone. \"Oh, well, that's cool. I thought it would be for my rock album, I'd take it.",
      "\u201cIt feels good. I\u2019m always appreciative of everything. I don\u2019t work for that, but it\u2019s always good to say \u2018you\u2019ve done good work,' and for somebody to acknowledge that. So, I\u2019m always proud of every award I get and every mention I get. That just makes me feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "She's up against producer Guy Oldfield, George Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Jimmy Carter, who could become the oldest Grammy award winner in history at 100.",
      "So, what\u2019s missing? Like last year, there\u2019s a huge dearth of Latin music \u2014 the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States \u2014 across the board, and no representation in the major categories. There are also only four entries in the best M\u00fasica Mexicana album category, despite it also being one of the fastest growing genres.",
      "And K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across their career.",
      "\u201cI definitely see room for improvement across many genres and we are continuing to invite people to be a part of the academy,\u201d Mason jr. says. \u201cWithout the right representation we don\u2019t get the right results. When I say right, I mean reflective and representative of what\u2019s happening in music today. So, the work continues.\u201d",

      "It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show",
      "NEW YORK -- It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show. Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to a record-breaking 99 nominations. There's an incredible diversity of genres represented across the major categories, and women continue to succeed. So... who didn\u2019t make the cut? What were the best surprises of all? Let\u2019s take a look.",
      "Country music has bled into other prominent genres and the Recording Academy has taken note. Country hybridists \u2014 like Beyonc\u00e9, Post Malone and first-time nominee Shaboozey \u2014 lead many nominations, in country and beyond.",
      "But that means the traditionalists might not see rewards: CMA Awards favorites Cody Johnson\u2019s \u201cLeather\u201d and Luke Combs\u2019 \u201cFathers & Sons\u201d didn\u2019t see any nominations. The latter shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise: Comb\u2019s blockbuster cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated for record of the year at the Grammys in 2024, either \u2013 though it did land a nod in best country solo performance.",
      "This year also marks Malone and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first-ever nominations in the country categories.",
      "Who saw this one coming? The Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then,\" is up for record of the year. Released in 2023, the song utilized artificial intelligence to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo. It's the same technology used to separate the Beatles\u2019 voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary series, \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back.\u201d",
      "Last summer, the Recording Academy announced a series of changes to the Grammy Awards, including new protocols involving technological advancements in machine learning. It sparked headlines: \u201cOnly human creators\u201d could win the music industry\u2019s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music. At the 2025 Grammys, clearly, those changes are in action.",
      "Last year's album of the year category was dominated by pop women \u2014 and that continues, with Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX's rave-ready approach to the genre receiving noms. The latter is a nice surprise (more on that below), but the two men nominated are creative outliers. OutKast frontman Andr\u00e9 3000's experimental jazz-flute album \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a contender, as well as Jacob Collier's \u201cDjesse Vol. 4,\u201d though that one may fulfill a space left vacant by Jon Batiste.",
      "Charli XCX, having never received a solo artist nomination at the Grammys, is up for seven awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those include record and album of the year, as well as pop solo and pop duo/group performance, pop dance recording, dance/electronic album and music video. Clearly, her culture-shifting \u201cBRAT\u201d album \u2014 and the summer of memes it inspired \u2014 has continued to hold real influence.",
      "There is no shortage of first-time nominees this year. Some were expected \u2014 like Roan, Carpenter and Shaboozey \u2014 others less so. Willow Smith has received her first nomination in the arrangement, instruments and vocals category for arranging her song \u201cb i g f e e l i n g s.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially successful Black woman musician in country, is featured alongside Shaboozey on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII,\" which is up for the melodic rap performance category. That delivers the progenitor her first-ever Grammy nomination at age 83.",
      "And lastly, Morgan Wallen \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most popular musicians in the country, and one rife with controversy \u2014 has received his first two Grammy nominations for his feature on Malone's \u201cI Had Some Help.\u201d Last year, his song \u201cLast Night\u201d was nominated for best country song, but that is a songwriter\u2019s award, and Wallen did not receive a nod.",
      "In the past, the country singer has been absent from nominations. In 2021, after video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his bestselling \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Just like last year, Latin music is missing from the top categories at the 2025 Grammys, despite a surplus of eligible talent: Peso Pluma\u2019s \u201c\u00c9xodo,\" Shakira\u2019s \u201cLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\u201d Residente, \u201cLas Letras Ya No Importan,\" Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n's \u201cBoca Chueca, Vol. 1\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d among them.",
      "Same as above: K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across its career.",
      "Despite being one of the great global superstars of the current moment \u2014 regularly celebrated as one of the most streamed artists on the planet \u2014 Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d received only one nomination, for m\u00fasica urbana album.",
      "And Usher, who had a blockbuster year \u2014 including a star-studded Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 also received only one nomination, for R&B album.",
      "In pop, Dua Lipa's \u201cEternal Optimism\" is nowhere to be seen. In country, best new artist hopeful Megan Moroney received no nominations. In R&B, Normani's long-awaited debut album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d failed to make waves with voters, and in rap, Nicki Minaj's \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d and Megan Thee Stallion's \u201cMegan\u201d are absent.",
      "Last year, Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. This year, he didn't receive a nod in that category \u2014 one he has held a place in since 2019. Who will take the mantle?",

      "LONDON -- A father and daughter crippled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 were awarded 45,000 pounds ($58,000) Friday in a case against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed.",
      "Hall, an independent producer, had claimed \u201cmillions of people have bought a lie\u201d about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest.",
      "Justice Karen Steyn called Hall\u2019s conduct a \u201cnegligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.\" She said he used the \u201cflimsiest of analytical techniques\u201d to dismiss \"the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.\u201d",
      "Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with \u201cdeep psychological injuries,\u201d police said.",
      "Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage.",
      "The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000).",
      "The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money.",
      "\u201cWhat this was about was bringing him down in public, in front of his own followers, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done,\" he said outside court.",
      "Hall said the trial was unfair and continued to insist the bombing didn't happen as he left the court."

      "Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs has filed a new request for bail, saying changed circumstances, along with new evidence, mean he should be allowed to prepare for a May trial from outside jail",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs filed a new request for bail on Friday, saying changed circumstances, along with new evidence, mean the hip-hop mogul should be allowed to prepare for a May trial from outside jail.",
      "Lawyers for Combs filed the request in Manhattan federal court, where his previous requests for bail have been rejected by two judges since his September arrest on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees, while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",
      "He has been awaiting a May 5 trial at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn.",
      "In their new court filing, lawyers for Combs say they are proposing a \u201cfar more robust\u201d bail package that would subject the entertainer to strict around-the-clock security monitoring and near-total restrictions on his ability to contact anyone but his lawyers.

      "They also cite new evidence that they say \u201cmakes clear that the government's case is thin.\u201d That evidence, the lawyers said, refutes the government's claim that a March 2016 video showing Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend occurred during a coerced \u201cfreak off,\u201d a sexually driven event described in the indictment against Combs.",
      "They wrote that the encounter was instead \u201ca minutes-long glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\u201d between Combs and his then-girlfriend.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 16:10:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
    "story": [
      "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
      "Megan Park feels a little bad that her movie is making so many people cry. It's not just a single tear either \u2014 more like full body sobs.",
      "She didn\u2019t set out to make a tearjerker with \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d now streaming on Prime Video. She just wanted to tell a story about a young woman in conversation with her older self. The film is quite funny (the dialogue between 18-year-old and almost 40-year-old Elliott happens because of a mushroom trip that includes a Justin Bieber cover), but it packs an emotional punch, too.",
      "Writing, Park said, is often her way of working through things. When she put pen to paper on \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d she was a new mom and staying in her childhood bedroom during the pandemic. One night, she and her whole nuclear family slept under the same roof. She didn\u2019t know it then, but it would be the last time, and she started wondering what it would be like to have known that.",
      "In the film, older Elliott ( Aubrey Plaza ) advises younger Elliott ( Maisy Stella ) to not be so eager to leave her provincial town, her younger brothers and her parents and to slow down and appreciate things as they are. She also tells her to stay away from a guy named Chad who she meets the next day and discovers that, unfortunately, he's quite cute.",
      "At 38, Park is just getting started as a filmmaker. Her first, \u201cThe Fallout,\u201d in which Jenna Ortega plays a teen in the aftermath of a school shooting, had one of those pandemic releases that didn\u2019t even feel real. But it did get the attention of Margot Robbie \u2019s production company LuckyChap Entertainment, who reached out to Park to see what other ideas she had brewing.",
      "\u201cThey were very instrumental in encouraging me to go with it,\u201d Park said. \u201cThey\u2019re just really even-keeled, good people, which makes them great producers. They treat everybody the same, which is the vibe that I like. There\u2019s no ego, there\u2019s no hierarchy.\u201d",
      "LuckyChap even empowered her to cast Stella first and to build it out around her. In a more traditional setting, she said, you have to start with the most famous person.",
      "Park came to writing and directing after some 20 years of acting. The product of a small town in Canada (Lindsay, Ontario), she knew she loved the arts but had no connections to the industry. The only job she could imagine for herself was actor, she said. Luckily, she had some success at it, with roles in films (\"Charlie Bartlett\u201d) and television shows like \u201cLife with Derek\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\u201d (she was Grace, the conservative cheerleader). It was on that show that she met one of her dearest friends, Shailene Woodley, and started to realize that perhaps acting wasn\u2019t quite her passion.",
      "There wasn\u2019t one \u201cah-ha\u201d moment, but she does remember seeing how passionate Woodley was about getting the role \u201cThe Descendants,\u201d which would prove to be her breakout.",
      "\u201cShe really wanted that role and she knew that it was her role and she was just like fighting for it and working so hard and was so passionate. I remember thinking that\u2019s so inspiring and so cool that she feels that way about this. And then I was like, \u2018(expletive), I don\u2019t feel that way about acting.\u2019\"",
      "Instead, Park found that spark in writing, and eventually directing, starting with shorts and music videos for the likes of Billie Eilish, Gucci Mane and even her husband, singer-songwriter Tyler Hilton, before setting off to do a feature.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really know that writing and directing movies was a viable career. So I came about it a little bit backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so lucky that I had such an education of like 20 years on a film set before I was ever behind the camera, where I was really absorbing way more than I thought I was absorbing.\u201d",
      "As a filmmaker, Park said she has two aesthetic extremes inside of her. The first is \u201cheartfelt, evergreen, nostalgic movies.\u201d Think Chris Columbus, \u201cStepmom,\u201d \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d and \u201cMy Girl,\u201d she said. Her other passion is quiet, French, female-driven cinema. C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s \u201cTomboy\u201d is the only movie she has downloaded on her computer. On set, she likes to keep things calm, reminding those around her that they\u2019re not \u201csaving lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI genuinely think that\u2019s an important mentality to have because people get so caught up in it. There\u2019s always going to be a fire, there\u2019s always going to be not enough time, but there\u2019s always going to be a fix to the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to just be clear with what I need, but also really flexible. I think the best directors are people who consider their role as not as the end-all, be-all genius behind the magic because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re the curator of creating an environment for creativity to thrive.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s seen all the extremes as an actor: The energies that work, the ones that don\u2019t and how all actors need different things from the director. And her actors appreciate that about her.",
      "\u201cI want every single movie for the rest of my life to be directed by a woman,\u201d said Stella. \u201cIt was one of my favorite experiences. I was just constantly surrounded by female energy, which was very inspiring for me and very safe. It just felt very cozy and sweet and it was very easy to work in that environment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been almost a year now since \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d became one of the breakout films of the Sundance Film Festival, and almost three years since she started working on it, or, basically half of her nearly 5-year-old daughter\u2019s life (she calls it \u201cthe Maisie movie\u201d). With a new 4-month-old as well, she's just started work on another film. But she\u2019s still feeling the glow from \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d and the effect it\u2019s having on audiences.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really get your hopes that high that people are going to feel anything, let alone how deeply they seem to be feeling the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of surreal, honestly and really beautiful and hard to metabolize it all.\u201d"

      "The U.S. exhibit showcases seven African American artists whose works examine the past, present and future repercussions of slavery. It's part of the international festival held every other year and known as Dak\u2019Art.",

      "This year's theme, \u201cThe Wake,\u201d has 58 artists from 33 countries exploring various meanings and evocations of the term, such as exhumation, mourning and uprooting, according to the organizers.",
      "The central idea behind it is to link the past and the future by giving them equal importance, Salimata Diop, Dak\u2019Art\u2019s artistic director said in a statement distributed to the media.",
      "The United States was the guest of honor of this year\u2019s show.",

      "There was also an entire new alphabet depicted on the curly hair pattern of African hair, as well as an immersive exhibit attempting to let viewers experience what it might have felt like to be a slave and be thrown into the water.",
      "The wake of slavery impacted all Americans, said Diana Baird N\u2019Diaye, the show's curator. She is based between the U.S. and Senegal. The displayed art does not only relate to the past, but also looks towards the future, she added.",

      "In a region rocked in recent years by coups and extremist violence, Senegal has managed to maintain its reputation as a stable democracy. Still, Senegal's ruling party, which is facing an election next week, has pledged to review its relationship with Western countries, but so far has not made any radical decisions.",
      "Khady Di\u00e8ne Gaye, Senegal's minister of youth, sports and culture, told reporters that the U.S. role as the guest of honor is \u201ca display of the importance of art as a tool for dialogue between peoples, the promotion of peace, mutual understanding, but most importantly as a tool for economic and social development.\u201d",
      "The Dak\u2019Art runs until Dec. 7. Originally scheduled for May, it was postponed following political tensions around the April presidential election and funding issues that the new authorities blamed on the former administration."

      "Argentine prosecutors say that three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month",
      "BUENOS AIRES -- Three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month, Argentine prosecutors said Thursday.",
      "Prosecutor Andr\u00e9s Madrea charged the three suspects, whose identities were not revealed, with \u200b\u200bthe crimes of \u201cabandonment of a person followed by death\u201d and \u201csupplying and facilitating the use of narcotics,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Madrea also requested their arrest to judge Laura Bruniard, who ruled the three cannot leave the country.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo, in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne\u2019s toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\u201d in the moments before his death.",
      "Investigators said hours after Payne\u2019s death that he was by himself when he fell. But the prosecutors' office said Thursday that one of the people charged was often with the singer during his time in Buenos Aires. The second is a hotel staffer who allegedly gave Payne cocaine during his stay between Oct. 13 and 16. And the third is a drug dealer.",
      "The charges in Payne\u2019s case bear some resemblance to the U.S. cases stemming from the death of \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry a year ago. The actor\u2019s personal assistant and a longtime friend are among those charged with helping supply him with ketamine in the final months of his life, leading up to his overdose on the anesthetic.",
      "Three young men were similarly charged in the opioid-overdose death of rapper Mac Miller in 2018.",
      "Local authorities gathered, among other pieces of evidence, Payne's cell phone records, material for forensics and testimonies. They are yet to unlock the singer\u2019s personal computer \u2013 which is damaged \u2013 and other devices that were seized.",
      "Payne\u2019s autopsy showed his injuries were neither caused by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the chances of Payne committing suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",
      "The singer had posted on his Snapchat account that he traveled to Argentina to attend Horan\u2019s concert in Buenos Aires on Oct. 2. He shared videos of himself dancing with his girlfriend, American influencer Kate Cassidy, and singing along in the stands. Cassidy had left Argentina after the show, but Payne stayed behind.",

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d enjoyed another weekend at the top of the box office. The Sony release starring Tom Hardy added $26.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "It was a relatively quiet weekend for North American movie theaters leading up to the presidential election. Charts were dominated by big studio holdovers, like \u201cVenom 3,\u201d \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d and \u201cSmile 2,\u201d while audiences roundly rejected the Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Robert Zemeckis reunion \u201cHere.\u201d Thirty years after \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cHere\u201d opened to only $5 million from 2,647 locations.",
      "\u201cVenom 3\u201d only fell 49% in its second weekend, which is a notably small drop for a superhero film, though it didn\u2019t exactly open like one either. In two weeks, the movie has made over $90 million domestically; The first two opened to over $80 million. Globally, the picture is brighter given that it has already crossed the $300 million threshold.",
      "Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to attract moviegoers even six weeks in (and when it\u2019s available by video on demand), placing second with $7.6 million. That's up 11% from last weekend. The animated charmer has made over $121 million in North America and $269 million worldwide.",
      "\"'The Wild Robot' has quietly been this absolute juggernaut for the fall season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor that film to see an increase after six weeks is astounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile 2\u201d landed in third place with $6.8 million, helping to push its worldwide total to $109.7 million.",
      "The time-hopping \u201cHere,\u201d a graphic novel that was adapted by \u201cForrest Gump\u201d screenwriter Eric Roth, was financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony\u2019s TriStar. With a fixed position camera, it takes audiences through the years in one living room. Critics were not on board: In aggregate it has a lousy 36% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cIt was a slow weekend anyway, but it didn\u2019t resonate in a way that many thought it might,\" Dergarabedian said. \"There are a lot of films out there for the audience that \u2018Here\u2019 was chasing.\"",
      "Despite playing in almost 1,000 more locations, \u201cHere\u201d came in behind Focus Features' papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d which earned $5.3 million. Playing in 1,796 theaters, \u201cConclave\u201d dropped only 20% from its debut last weekend and has made $15.2 million so far. Two Indian films also cracked the top 10 in their debuts, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d and \u201cSingham Again.\u201d",
      "Overall box office continues to lag behind 2023 by almost 12%. But holiday moviegoing will likely give the industry an end-of-year boost with titles like \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d on the way.",
      "\u201cIn a couple of weeks, it\u2019ll get a lot more competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d a comedic drama about cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, launched in four theaters this weekend in New York and Los Angeles. It made an estimated $240,000, or $60,000 per screen, which is among the top three highest per theater averages of the year. Searchlight Pictures will be expanding the well-reviewed film nationwide in the coming weeks, going wide on Nov. 15 to over 800 theaters.",
      "Box office charts don\u2019t always paint a full picture of the moviegoing landscape, however. This weekend several relatively high-profile films playing in theaters did not report full grosses for various reasons, including the Clint Eastwood film \u201cJuror #2,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s WWII film \u201cBlitz\u201d and the Cannes darling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d Netflix, which is handling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d never reports box office. Apple Original Films is following suit with \u201cBlitz,\u201d a likely awards contender, which is in theaters before hitting Apple TV+ on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is a Warner Bros. release, and a well-reviewed one at that. The film directed by Eastwood stars Nicholas Hoult as a juror on a murder case who faces a big moral dilemma. Domestic ticket sales were withheld. The studio did say that it earned $5 million from international showings, where it played on 1,348 screens.",
      "Even major studios withhold box office numbers occasionally. Earlier this year, Disney did not report on the Daisy Ridley movie \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea.\u201d Results were most notably withheld during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It\u2019s really up to the distributors,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cOften times the reason that certain movies may not be reported is that there\u2019s a chance that the quality of the movie will be conflated with the box office number.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, were:",
      "1. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $26.1 million.",
      "2. \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d $7.6 million.",

      "Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince\u2019s only full sibling, died Monday",
      "NEW YORK -- Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince's only full sibling, died Monday at North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, her son President Nelson confirmed to The Associated Press. She was 64.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, and President Nelson said he doesn't expect to know \u201cfor a couple of days.\u201d",
      "Born to jazz musician John L. Nelson and Mattie Della Shaw in 1960, two years after Prince, Nelson was a singer-songwriter, releasing four albums across her career, starting with 1988's \u201cRoyal Blue.\" That album produced her biggest hits, \u201cMarc Anthony\u2019s Tune,\u201d which spent 11 weeks on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 33, and \u201cL.O.V.E.,\" which spent seven weeks on the chart and topped at No. 52.",
      "At the time, she told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, \u201cThe album is basically about love relationships between a man and a woman. I\u2019m royal blue because I can\u2019t find him,\u201d she said.",
      "It's an alternative to her brother's chosen color of purple. Of their relationship, she said: \u201cThe funniest thing is people say, \u2018How does it feel to be Prince\u2019s sister?\u2019 They don\u2019t actually realize what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been Prince\u2019s sister ever since I got here on Earth.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press described her \u201cRoyal Blue\u201d album as \"mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening\" material, \u201cfar removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound. Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Then came 1992's \u201cYellow Moon, Red Sky,\u201d 2008's \u201cA Brand New Me,\u201d and finally, 2011's \u201cHustler.\u201d",
      "Nelson is survived by two sons, President and Sir, and five grandchildren.",
      "\u201cBorn 1960, the daughter of Mattie and John Nelson, she was best known as Prince\u2019s sister and worked to keep his legacy alive with his fans attending fan and industry events,\u201d President Nelson shared in a statement. \u201cServices will be private, and in lieu of flowers, the family has asked that you take care of one another.\u201d",
      "According to the Star Tribune, Nelson was scheduled to retire and perform a farewell concert at the Dakota in downtown Minneapolis in June. Illness caused her not to take the stage. A few days before the concert, she said she had a mixtape on the way and was working on a memoir.",
      "Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose in 2016 at his home in Minneapolis. He was 57. He had no will, and his six siblings inherited equal interests in the estate: Tyka Nelson and five half-siblings \u2014 Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John R. Nelson, Omarr Baker and Alfred Jackson.",
      "Tyka Nelson, Baker and Jackson, the three youngest, sold their stake to a music publishing company called Primary Wave Music, LLC, which later assigned its interests to an affiliate, Prince OAT Holdings LLC. Jackson has since died.",
      "Representatives for Paisley Park, Prince\u2019s private estate which is also a museum, studio, and concert venue in Chanhassen, Minnesota, did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment.",

      "After months of reporting on what polls described as a remarkably close race, news outlets finally have the chance to report on actual results",
      "For all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.",
      "Fox News Channel declared Donald Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. \u201cThis is, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\u201d Trump said onstage at his victory party in West Palm Beach.",
      "His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would speak later Wednesday morning, her campaign manager said, dispersing a crowd that had gathered to celebrate her at Howard University.",
      "Broadcast, cable news networks, digital news sites and one streaming service \u2014 Amazon \u2014 covered the count steadily into Wednesday morning. Many of their journalists had warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days, like it had in 2020.",
      "Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. Eastern time, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. The dam broke at 11:18 p.m. on Tuesday, when the AP called the first of seven battleground states, North Carolina, for the former president.",
      "The networks moved quickly into the post-mortem stage.",
      "\u201cThis looks a lot more like 2016 to me than 2020,\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said, a reference to Trump\u2019s victory that year over Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
      "Fox News Channel pointed to exit poll results that showed Trump making gains among young voters and Latinos. \u201cThe Biden-Harris people pushed them into Trump\u2019s open arms,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Fox News' Brit Hume said, \u201cit's time for his enemies to stop it.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Trump praised his running mate, JD Vance, for \u201cgoing into the enemy camp\u201d for interviews on places like CNN and MSNBC. \u201cHe absolutely obliterated them,\u201d he said.",
      "Hours earlier, when the first exit poll results showed the unpopularity of President Joe Biden and Americans with a dim view of where the country was headed, CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace said that \u201cit would be a miracle if Harris could win with that.\u201d His colleagues, Dana Bash and Audie Cornish, warned him of jumping to conclusions that Harris would be blamed for that, but Wallace sounded more prescient as the night progressed.",
      "\u201cShe was trying to do something as a sitting vice president that had never been done before \u2014 succeed an unpopular president,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, an NBC News analyst, said the element of race could not be discounted. Some Americans were more comfortable with President Joe Biden, a white man, than Harris, who was attempting to be the first woman of color to be elected president, she said.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine a woman of color acting the way Donald Trump acted \u2014 even for one day?\u201d CNN analyst Van Jones said. \u201cThe kinds of stuff that he said, the kinds of stuff that he did, the way that he would insult people. If you're a person of color, you don't feel like you have the freedom.\u201d",
      "Trump had \u201ca license to just be a fool, just to be an obnoxious ass ... and he gets to be president,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Due to remarkably close pre-election polls, the outcome was considered a mystery that could take many days to resolve. In his last pre-election prediction, statistician Nate Silver said it was no better than a coin flip, giving an ever-so-slight edge to Harris.",
      "The New York Times' predictive Needle judged the contest a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the beginning of the evening, leaning slightly toward Trump. But it moved steadily in Trump's direction, to the point where the Times by midnight judged Trump with a 90 percent likelihood of capturing the presidency again.",
      "Also by midnight, CNN's count had Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 the so-called blue wall that was central to her strategy for victory.",
      "\u201cIt's not mission impossible\u201d for Harris to come back and win Pennsylvania, CNN's John King said, looking over voter statistics. \u201cBut it's becoming mission improbable.\u201d Within two hours, CNN awarded Pennsylvania to Trump.",
      "For much of the night, the journalists who stood before \u201cmagic boards\u201d \u2014 King, Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel, Steve Kornacki on MSNBC \u2014 took up much of the airtime with granular reports on results. State-by-state, county-by-county, they showed numbers where Trump was outperforming his 2020 campaign and Harris lagged behind Biden\u2019s results.",
      "If anything, the networks relied too much on their numbers czars than on their reporters.",
      "The presence of actual results were a tonic to news organizations that had weeks \u2014 and an excruciatingly long day of voting \u2014 to talk about an election campaign that polls have repeatedly shown to be remarkably tight. They tried to extract wisdom from anecdotal evidence.",
      "\u201cDixville Notch is a metaphor for the entire race,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alyssa Farah Griffin said, making efforts to draw meaning from the tiny New Hampshire community that reported its 3-3 vote for Harris and Trump in the early morning hours.",
      "Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams, during his one-night leading Amazon's streamcast appearance, had one unexpected guest in the California studio where he was operating. Puck reporter Tara Palmeri was supposed to report from Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach but was denied credentials to attend by the former president's team.",
      "Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita described her as a \u201cgossip columnist\u201d in a post on the social media site X. Palmeri told Williams she had accurately reported some anxiety within the Trump camp about who was voting early.",
      "Neither Axios nor Politico would immediately confirm reports that some of their reporters were similarly banned, and the Trump campaign did not immediately return a call for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Anti-abortion advocates say they will quickly dismantle some of President Joe Biden's abortion policies once President-elect Donald Trump makes his return to the White House next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Anti-abortion advocates say there is still work to be done to further restrict access to abortion when Republican Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.",
      "They point to the federal guidance that the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden released around emergency abortions, requiring that hospitals provide them for women whose health or life is at risk, and its easing of prescribing restrictions for abortion pills that have allowed women to order the medication online with the click of a button.",
      "\u201cNow the work begins to dismantle the pro-abortion policies of the Biden-Harris administration,\" the Susan B. Anthony List, the powerful anti-abortion lobby, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s first-term pro-life accomplishments are the baseline for his second term.\u201d",
      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that.",
      "Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors.",
      "The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk.",
      "The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems \u2014 eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain.",
      "Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. \u201cOur world is stacked against us,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines:",
      "A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death.",
      "Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association.",
      "The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood.",
      "Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check.",
      "Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke.",
      "Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity \u2014 or some combination \u2014 per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home.",
      "Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated.",
      "The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes.",
      "But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital.",
      "The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t have insurance or they can\u2019t get to a doctor\u2019s office because of transportation issues or they can\u2019t get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,\" Bushnell said.",
      "Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership.",
      "The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause.",
      "Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil has been flooded by some legal platforms that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and also illegal sites based in China.",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched supreme court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court, which struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in October and is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. The open race for retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley's seat comes after the court flipped from conservative control in a 2023 election marked by record-breaking spending.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like state supreme court elections are going to go back to the way they were 10 years ago anytime soon,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",

      "The Tobacco and Vapes Bill would also bar smoking and vaping in some outdoor spaces such as playgrounds and the entrances to schools and hospitals. But a proposed ban on smoking in pub beer gardens has been dropped after opposition from bar owners.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the hospitality industry had \u201ctaken a real battering in recent years\u201d and it is not \u201cthe right time\u201d to ban smoking outside pubs.",
      "The bill also proposes to restrict vape flavors and ban bright vape packaging aimed at children, to combat \u201ca cynical industry that has sought to addict a new generation of children to nicotine,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July\u2019s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain.",
      "It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18.",
      "If passed \u2013 as is likely because of the governing Labour Party\u2019s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world.",
      "The government said the bill \u201cbreaks the cycle of addiction and paves the way for a smoke-free U.K.\u201d",
      "The number of people who smoke in Britain has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people \u2014 or about 13% of the population \u2014 still smoke, according to official figures.",
      "Authorities say smoking causes some 80,000 deaths a year in the U.K, and remains the number one preventable cause of death, disability and poor health."

      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "Police used surveillance camera footage to track down Kwan.",
      "They found he had hatched an elaborate plot by sending fake letters with National Health Service logos, hyperlinks and even a QR code to offer a home visit for a COVID booster to O'Hara. Kwan disguised himself in head-to-toe protective gear, tinted glasses and a surgical mask and drove a vehicle to the appointment in January using fake license plates.",
      "Kwan, who was described as having a morbid obsession with poisons, used iodomethane, a substance found in pesticides that he thought would be difficult for medics to detect, the judge said.",
      "Police found arsenic, liquid mercury and castor beans, which can be used to make the chemical weapon ricin, during a search of his home. He had instructions on how to make ricin on his computer.",
      "The judge said Kwan was upset about getting a smaller share of his inheritance when his father died. He had a strained relationship with his mother, and learned that she had a provision in her will that would allow O'Hara to stay in her home if she died before him.",
      "\"Your resentment and bitterness towards your mother and Mr. O\u2019Hara was all to do with money and your belief you were not being given money which you thought you were entitled to,\u201d Lambert said.",
      "O'Hara said justice had been served by the sentence."

      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",

A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",

      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate.

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

Local media gave his name as Fernando Guerrero Alc\u00e1ntar, but a navy spokesman would not confirm that, or whether he was in uniform at the time.",
      "The navy said in a statement that he was driving in his own private vehicle when the attack occurred, so it was unclear if the gunmen knew who he was.",
      "He would be one of the highest-ranking military officers killed in Mexico since 2013.",
      "That year, gunmen in the neighboring state of Michoacan ambushed and killed Vice Adm. Carlos Miguel Salazar, the top navy commander in the neighboring Pacific coastal state of Jalisco. Members of the Knights Templar drug cartel were blamed for that killing.",
      "Vice admiral is a slightly higher rank than rear admiral.",
      "Attacks by Mexican cartels on high-ranking officers have occurred, but are relatively rare.",
      "However, the Mexican government has given more law-enforcement responsibility to the navy, army and the militarized National Guard in recent years, and they now represent the front-line forces against the country's drug cartels.",
      "Manzanillo, because it is a Pacific coast port with direct shipments from China and other places in Asia, is highly prized by drug cartels seeking to smuggle in precursor chemicals to produce the deadly opioid fentanyl."

      "\u201cThey want to get rid of me. When they want me dead, it means that I\u2019m doing something. I\u2019m hurting them so bad,\" Alinejad, 48, said, referring to the Iranian government. \u201cI\u2019m echoing the voice of powerful women and that scares them.\u201d",

It stands along a four-kilometer (2.5-mile ) stretch of the former wall in downtown Berlin.",
      "The posters combine the demands of East German protesters against the communist authorities in autumn 1989, such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom to travel, with current day wishes and were created as part of workshops in schools, church parishes, local art groups and cultural projects.",

      "In Washington, a U.S. official said the Biden administration informed Qatar two weeks ago that the Hamas office's continued operation in Doha was no longer useful and the Hamas delegation should be expelled.",
      "A senior U.S. official said that after Hamas rejected the last proposal for a cease-fire, Qatar accepted the advice and informed the Hamas delegation of the decision 10 days ago.",
      "A senior Hamas official said they were aware of Qatar\u2019s decision to suspend mediation efforts, \u201cbut no one told us to leave.\u201d Hamas has repeatedly called for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza as a condition for any cease-fire deal. Israel seeks the return of all hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and insists on a presence in Gaza.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office had no comment.",
      "Late Saturday, the state-run Qatar News Agency published comments attributed to Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, confirming that Doha informed parties in the talks 10 days ago that it \u201cwould stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round.\u201d",
      "\u201cQatar will resume those efforts with its partners when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians,\" the report said.",
      "There continued to be no end in sight to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon, where Israel\u2019s military said it struck command centers and other militant infrastructure in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and elsewhere. An Israeli airstrike on the southern port city of Tyre late Friday killed at least seven, officials and a resident said.",
      "Hezbollah \u201cshould continue (the fight) and we will continue to back them up even if we lose our families, our homes, and end up in the dirt,\u201d said one Beirut resident, Mohammed Mekdad, as people searched the smoking rubble.",
      "In Gaza, Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said, while Israel announced the first delivery of humanitarian aid in weeks to the territory's hungry, devastated north.",
      "One strike hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City\u2019s eastern Tufah neighborhood, killing at least six people, the territory's Health Ministry said. Two local journalists, a pregnant woman and a child were among the dead, it said. Israel's army said the strike targeted a militant belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, offering no evidence.",
      "Another Israeli strike killed seven people, including two women and a child in the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital. Israel's army didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "And an Israeli strike hit tents in the courtyard of central Gaza\u2019s main hospital, killing at least three people and wounding a local journalist, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said. It was the eighth Israeli attack on the compound since March.",
      "The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said 11 aid trucks containing food, water and medical equipment reached the enclave's far north on Thursday. It's the first time any aid has reached there since Israel began a new military campaign last month.",
      "But not all the aid reached the agreed drop-off points, according to the the U.N. World Food Program. In the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya, Israeli troops stopped one convoy bound for nearby Beit Lahiya and ordered the supplies to be offloaded, WFP spokesperson Alia Zaki said.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has focused on Jabaliya, where Israel says Hamas had regrouped. Other areas affected include Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun just north of Gaza City.",
      "The aid announcement came days before a U.S. deadline demanding that Israel improve aid deliveries across Gaza or risk losing access to U.S. weapons funding. The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies.",
      "A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, issued Thursday said there's a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza, the territory's most isolated area.",
      "COGAT rejected those findings and said the report relied \u201con partial, biased data and superficial sources with vested interests.\u201d",
      "The U.N. estimates that tens of thousands of people remain in northern Gaza. Earlier this week, the Health Ministry said there were no ambulances or emergency crews operating north of Gaza City.",
      "The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to U.N. figures.",
      "More than a year of war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They don't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children.",
      "The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people \u2014 mostly civilians \u2014 and abducting 250 others. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third believed to be dead.",
      "\u201cIt has been 400 days and the hostages are still in Gaza. There is a war without a direction. It\u2019s so sad,\u201d said Eial Tiskim, who attended the latest protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday night to demand a cease-fire deal.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Stefanos Kasselakis, a businessman who burst into Greek politics over a year ago, said he was leaving left-wing Syriza, the country's main opposition party he had led, and forming his own.",
      "Kasselakis announced he was leaving Syriza Friday after a two-day party congress refused to consider his leadership candidacy in a contest that will take place later this month.",
      "Kasselakis, 36, has lived most of his life in the U.S. and only entered Greek politics in May 2023 as a candidate in a national election. Syriza, already the main opposition party, suffered a disastrous double defeat at elections held in May and June of that year. He unexpectedly entered the leadership contest to replace longtime leader Alexis Tsipras and triumphed in September 2023.",
      "His main opponent and several of her supporters bolted the party in December 2023, forming a new organization, New Left. Many of the Syriza members who had supported Kasselakis soon soured on him, accusing him of not being a true leftist. Kasselakis did not endear himself with his confrontational style and open disdain for the elected party organs.",
      "In September, Syriza's central committee ousted Kasselakis from his post after a motion of no confidence. He contested the legitimacy of the vote and was set to run in the leadership race but was stopped by the party's central committee.",
      "Along with Kasselakis, four lawmakers also bolted the party Friday and Saturday. This has left Syriza with 31 lawmakers in the 300-member Greek parliament, equal with the socialist PASOK party.",
      "Under Tsipras, Syriza had governed the country from 2015-2019. Recent opinion polls show party support back into single digits."

      "BEIRUT -- Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have returned to their country since Israel launched a massive aerial bombardment on wide swathes of Lebanon in September. Many who fled to Lebanon after the war in Syria started in 2011 did not want to go back.",
      "But for officials in Lebanon, the influx of returnees comes as a silver lining to the war between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 3,000 people and displaced some 1.2 million in Lebanon. Some in Syria hope the returning refugees could lead to more international assistance and relief from western sanctions.",
      "Nisreen al-Abed returned to her northwest Syrian hometown in October after 12 years as a refugee in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley. The airstrikes had been terrifying, but what really worried her was that her 8-year-old twin daughters need regular transfusions to treat a rare blood disorder, thalassemia.",

      "Joseph Daher, a Swiss-Syrian researcher and professor at the European University Institute in Florence, noted the number of arrests is small and that Assad's government might not view the returnees as a threat because they are mostly women and children.",
      "Still, Daher labeled government attempts to show the returning refugees are welcome as \u201cpropaganda,\u201d saying, \u201cthey\u2019re unwilling and not ready in terms of economics or politics to do it.\u201d",
      "UNHCR head Filippo Grandi said this week that his agency is working with the Syrian government \u201cto ensure the safety and security of all those arriving,\" and he urged donors to provide humanitarian aid and financial assistance to help Syria recover after 13 years of war.",

      "The attack happened when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, according to Hamza Shafqaat, a senior government administrator.",
      "When asked about a security breach that led to the bombing, Shafqaat told reporters that \u201cit is usually very difficult to stop such suicide attacks.\u201d",
      "However, Shahid Nawaz, who is in charge of security at Quetta\u2019s train station, insisted there was no breach as the attacker was disguised as a passenger and blew himself up among people at the station.",
      "TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform\u2019s roof blown apart and a destroyed tea stall. Luggage was strewn everywhere. Most of the victims were taken to a state-owned hospital and some to a military one.",
      "Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department and police said over a dozen soldiers and six railway employees were among the dead at the station, where a walk-through gate has been installed to check whether anyone is carrying explosives. Still, there are multiple other entrances to the station without such security.",
      "A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad.",
      "A senior superintendent of police operations, Muhammad Baloch, said separatists frequently attacked soft targets.",
      "\"When their people are arrested, they also attack in retaliation. We all have to fight this war. We are resilient. Our teams are here and trying to save as many lives as we can.\u201d",
      "Police said some of the critically wounded passengers had died in the hospital, raising the death toll.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack \u201cwill pay a very heavy price for it,\" adding that security forces were determined to eliminate \u201cthe menace of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry also condemned the bombing and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims, as did the Russian Embassy in Islamabad.",
      "Saturday's assault came a little over a week after a powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in the province, killing nine people, including five children who were nearby.",
      "In August, the BLA carried out multiple coordinated attacks on passengers buses, police and security forces across Balochistan, killing more than 50 people, mostly civilians.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest but also least populated province. It is a hub for the country\u2019s ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province.",
      "The BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is working on major infrastructure projects. The group often demands the halt of all Chinese-funded projects and for workers to leave Pakistan to avoid further attacks.",
      "Last month, the BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside Karachi airport, killing two. Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working in Balochistan and other parts of the country.",

      "He was traveling with five others, a mix of friends and family. They had all left Venezuela last Saturday with the goal of reaching the United States.",
      "He said the group had waited in Venezuela for the results of July's presidential election, but after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was declared winner despite evidence that he had lost, they decided to leave. \"We didn\u2019t see any hope,\u201d Ch\u00e1vez said.",

      "Through Tuesday, Panama had recorded nearly 289,000 migrant arrivals through the Darien. This is about 38% fewer compared with the same period last year. Sixty-nine percent of this year\u2019s arrivals were Venezuelans.",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Family members of a 31-year-old American tourist who was killed while on vacation in Hungary\u2019s capital mourned their loss while a 37-year-old suspect was in custody Saturday.",
      "The victim, Mackenzie Michalski from Portland, Oregon, was reported missing on Nov. 5 after she was last seen at a nightclub in central Budapest. Police launched a missing person investigation and reviewed security footage from local nightclubs where they observed Michalski with a man later identified as the suspect in several of the clubs the night of her disappearance.",
      "The man was detained on Nov. 7 and questioned by police, and later confessed to the killing.",
      "Before the confession, Michalski's family and friends had launched an effort to find her, starting a Facebook group to gather tips on her whereabouts. Her parents traveled to Hungary to assist in the search, but while en route learned that she had been killed.",
      "At a candlelight vigil in Budapest on Saturday night, the victim's father, Bill Michalski, told The Associated Press that he was \u201cstill overcome with emotion\" at the death of his daughter.",
      "\u201cThere was no reason for this to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to wrap my arms around what happened ... I don\u2019t know that I ever will.\"",
      "Police detained the suspect, an Irish citizen, on the evening of Nov. 7. Investigators said that Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub and danced before leaving for the man's rented apartment. The man killed Michalski while they were engaged in an \u201cintimate encounter,\u201d police said.",
      "The suspect, whom police identified by the initials L.T.M., confessed to the killing, but said it had been an accident. Police said that he had attempted to cover up his crime by cleaning the apartment and hiding Michalski's body in a wardrobe before purchasing a suitcase and placing her body inside.",
      "He then rented a car and drove to Lake Balaton, around 90 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Budapest, where he disposed of the body in a wooden area outside the town of Szigliget.",
      "Video released by police showed the suspect guiding authorities to the location where he had left the body. Police said the suspect had made internet searches before being apprehended on how to dispose of a body, police procedures in missing person cases, whether pigs really eat dead bodies, and the presence of wild boars in the Lake Balaton area.",
      "He also made an internet search inquiring on the competence of Budapest police.",
      "Crime scene photographs released by police showed a rolling suitcase, several articles of clothing including a pair of fleece-lined boots, and a small handbag next to a credit card bearing Michalski's name.",
      "According to a post by an administrator of a Facebook group called \u201cFind Mackenzie Michalski,\u201d which was created on Nov. 7, Michalski, who went by \u201cKenzie,\u201d was a nurse practitioner who \u201cwill forever be remembered as a beautiful and compassionate young woman.\u201d",
      "At the candlelight vigil in Budapest on Saturday, Michalski's father gave brief comments to those who had gathered, and was wearing a baseball cap he said he had received as a gift from his daughter.",
      "Michalski had visited Budapest before, and called it her \u201chappy place,\u201d her father told the AP.",
      "\u201cThe history, she just loved it and she was just so relaxed here,\" he said. \"This was her city.\u201d"

      "LONDON -- Michael Woods has visited his wife, Mary, every day since she moved into a nursing home two years ago.",
      "But on Sunday, the 100-year-old Royal Air Force veteran will skip the daily get-together so he can fulfill another duty \u2014 honoring the men he served with during World War II.",
      "For the first time since he left the RAF in 1947, Woods will take part in Britain\u2019s national Remembrance Day service, joining thousands of veterans as they march past the Cenotaph war memorial in central London to honor those who died during the world wars and all the conflicts that followed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great privilege for me to do this,\u201d said Woods, a mechanic who kept Lancaster bombers flying during the war. \u201cAnd I suppose I\u2019ll never do it again.\"",
      "The annual ceremony is a solemn event marked every year when the king and envoys from the Commonwealth nations that fought alongside Britain in the two world wars lay wreaths at the Cenotaph. It culminates when up to 10,000 veterans, many with medals gleaming on their chests and regimental berets on their heads, parade past the memorial.",
      "Until now, Woods has watched on television from his home in Dunstable, 30 miles (50 kilometers) away. Mary always watched with him.",
      "Woods had a lot on his mind before. For many years, he was busy with his family: two daughters, a son, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. And, more recently, he was looking after Mary, his wife of 68 years.",
      "But there was something else holding him back as well. He didn\u2019t feel he deserved the honor, as he was \u201cjust\" a mechanic working on the 12-cylinder Rolls-Royce Merlin engines that powered the Lancaster bombers. He changed his mind after he connected with other ex-service members through Blind Veterans UK, the charity that has helped him deal with macular degeneration and glaucoma.",
      "He felt it was time to remember the men who didn\u2019t come home after they roared into the sky aboard planes he had certified as airworthy. Each Lancaster carried a crew of seven, most in their early 20s, so the losses \u2014 so many at once \u2014 were hard to bear.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very, very upsetting when a Lancaster takes off and it doesn\u2019t return,\" Woods told The Associated Press.",

      "The RAF\u2019s Bomber Command had the highest attrition rate of any Allied unit during World War II, with 44% of aircrew members killed in action, according to the International Bomber Command Centre. Some 55,573 of the 125,000 who served on the aircrews died during the war.",
      "Adrian Bell, CEO of Blind Veterans UK, said he\u2019s met many World War II veterans who describe themselves as mere cogs in a massive machine. But that\u2019s what it took to defeat fascism. Everyone was needed.",
      "So come Sunday, Woods will be marching.",
      "With the stubbornness to retain his independence that seems to have come with turning 100, Woods insists he won\u2019t use a wheelchair because he has never used one before and isn\u2019t going to start now. Besides, his son, Eddie, will be there to act as a guide and his buddies from the charity will be nearby to offer emotional support.",
      "He will be an inspiration, Bell said.",
      "\u201cI think the most important thing is the fortitude of a man who is 100 years old, who fought in the Second World War and beyond, who is going to be there physically on Sunday and marching as a tribute to those who lost their lives and as a sort of a sign of hope and a sign ... that there is life after all of these things,\" Bell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the embodiment of something that I think is really important.\u201d"

      "Ecuador\u2019s Vice President Veronica Abad has been suspended for 150 days accused of \u201cunjustified abandonment\u201d of her duties",
      "QUITO -- Ecuador's Vice President Veronica Abad was suspended Saturday for 150 days accused of \u201cunjustified abandonment\u201d of her duties. It comes during a public rift between Abad and President Daniel Noboa that could have implications for Ecuador 's February elections.",
      "Abad's suspension without pay came at midnight, her lawyer Dominique D\u00e1vila told The Associated Press. D\u00e1vila called the move \u201cextremely serious\u201d and claimed it may not have any legal backing.",
      "Abad was accused by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of not following an order in September to temporarily transfer her from Israel \u2014 where she also serves as ambassador \u2014 to Turkey due to the conflict, arriving eight days after the order.",
      "Abad had argued that she was not \u201cproperly prepared\u201d for the trip to Turkey and that Ecuador's government suggested \u201cthat I leave my children in Israel to go to Turkey alone.\u201d",
      "The move comes at a time of deep tensions between Abad and Noboa who, despite running the government together, have clashed for years establishing a sort of feud, the origins of which are unknown.",
      "In August, Abad filed a legal complaint accusing Noboa and other officials of gender-based violence.",
      "The suspension was the second sanction against Abad in less than a week. Abad was also fined $8,500 on Tuesday by Ecuador\u2019s Electoral Disputes Tribunal for early election campaigning in 2023 when she was a candidate for mayor of the city of Cuenca.",
      "The vice president has previously cited the Israel case and other incidents as government measures to pressure her to resign, while the president has called her \u201cdisloyal.\u201d",
      "D\u00e1vila, Abad's lawyer, said the suspension was the latest attempt to push Abad out, calling it a \u201ctrick to prevent the presidential succession\u201d and something they planned to appeal.",
      "Abad\u2019s fate has special importance for Noboa, who hopes to run for reelection in February 2025, and will have to request a leave of absence to carry out the campaign, according to experts.",
      "In that case, Abad would take over the presidency, but with the recent sanctions, the pathway to her taking the reigns would be blocked, according to constitutional lawyer Andr\u00e9 Benavides. The expert said that while the suspension lacks strong legal backing, any appeals process to reverse the 150 day suspension would take longer than the suspension period."

      "That\u2019s what the allies have been doing. A total of 23 members are expected to meet the 2% target his year, compared to just three 10 years ago, according to NATO. Lithuania has already surpassed 2.5% with a goal of reaching 4%, which would be more than the United States.",
      "Europe\u2019s defense industry managed to increase output of some products after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 but European countries also donated their own weapons to Ukraine, and \u201cremain dependent on the U.S. for some important aspects of their military capability,\u201d a report published by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies at the Prague event said.",
      "Lithuania, which borders Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad exclave to the west and Belarus to the east, remains the largest buyer of U.S. arms among the three Baltic states.",

      "Kas\u010di\u016bnas insisted that Europe\u2019s military aid to Ukraine has to continue and Russia should not dictate the conditions for peace while a limited cease-fire would not make sense because it would only help Russian troops recover from losses and strike again.",
      "\u201cWe need a just peace, credible peace,\u201d he said.",

      "A soldier for Yemen\u2019s exiled government has opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom\u2019s nearly decadelong war there",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A soldier for Yemen\u2019s exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom's nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday.",
      "The assault in eastern Hadramawt province comes as a yearslong cease-fire between Saudi Arabia and Yemen's Houthi rebels largely has held despite the militants' ongoing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea corridor. While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being \u201cthe beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Houthis claimed new airstrikes targeting the rebel-held capital of Sanaa, likely carried out by the United States after the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone over the country.",
      "The attack took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 500 kilometers (310 miles) east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement.",
      "\u201cThe Joint Forces Command underscores that this \u2018Lone Wolf\u2019 cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,\u201d the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added.",
      "Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen's successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun.",
      "Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier's arrest. That's worth around $15,000 on the black market.",
      "Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group's Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to \u201ccoordinate operations directly with each other.\"",
      "The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from \u201cthe feeling of oppression\u201d over Saudi troops being stationed in the area.",
      "\u201cThe heroic operation is the beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders,\u201d Rizq wrote.",
      "Yemen has been mired in a decadelong war since the Houthis swept into Sanaa from their northern strongholds in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen's exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate.",
      "The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and Israel's invasion of Lebanon.",
      "On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported suspected U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes, which previously have targeted radar stations, military bases and drone and missile launch sites.",
      "The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning, the Houthis said.",

      "A natural gas utility that serves more than 2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and parts of California is being fined $2 million by regulators in Arizona",
      "PHOENIX -- A natural gas utility with more than 2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and parts of California is being fined $2 million by regulators in Arizona over concerns about piping that is known to degrade in the heat.",
      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",
      "It was reported that degradation and resulting leaks involved piping installed in the Southwest, particularly in the Mohave Desert region in Arizona, California and Nevada.",
      "In Arizona, state investigators concluded that Southwest Gas failed to properly map where this type of piping had been installed.",
      "Southwest Gas estimates there are more than 10,000 miles (16,100 kilometers) of the piping throughout Arizona. The utility says it has a plan to target high-risk areas for replacement or abandonment.",
      "The agreement between state regulators and Southwest Gas stems from two separate incidents in 2021, including one in Chandler in which an explosion injured four people.",
      "In addition to replacing or abandoning all newly discovered and previously unmapped spots that contain the defective piping, Southwest Gas must also notify regulators of any leaks.",
      "An amendment to the agreement that was proposed by Corporation Commissioner Kevin Thompson made clear that the company would have to propose new rates \u2014 and win regulatory approval through an administrative process \u2014 if it wants to recoup from customers any of the costs associated with fulfilling the agreement.",
      "\u201cThis matter has been before the commission long enough and the approval of this settlement is a big step in the direction of maintaining public safety and holding the utility accountable,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers should bear the entire responsibility for the mistakes of the manufacturer and their defective products, and I wish the utility would have pursued this path more aggressively when they had the chance.\u201d",
      "Southwest Gas also agreed to increase leak patrols throughout the year."

    "story": [
      "Cherokee Nation Entertainment has filed a lawsuit challenging a measure Arkansas voters approved this week that revokes its license for a planned casino in the state",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Cherokee Nation Entertainment on Friday filed a lawsuit challenging a constitutional amendment Arkansas voters approved this week that revokes its license for a planned casino in the state.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court claims the measure approved by voters on Tuesday violates its constitutional rights, and seeks to block its enforcement before it takes effect Nov. 13. The constitutional amendment blocks a casino that was planned in Pope County.",
      "Pope County was one of four sites where casinos were allowed to be built under a constitutional amendment that voters approved in 2018. Casinos have already been set up in the other three locations.",
      "\u201cCherokee Nation Entertainment is firmly committed to protecting its constitutional rights, defending its lawfully issued casino license, and safeguarding the substantial investments it made in good faith based on the establishment of the Pope County casino license under Amendment 100 in 2018,\" Bart Calhoun, an attorney for Cherokee Nation Entertainment, said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest in a costly fight between the Cherokee Nation and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, which had spent at least $30 million combined on the campaign over the ballot measure. The state Supreme Court last month rejected a lawsuit by the Cherokee Nation that sought to disqualify the measure from the ballot. The Choctaw Nation operates a casino near the Arkansas border.",
      "\u201cThis legal action to attempt to bypass the voice of Arkansas voters is not unexpected,\u201d said Hans Stiritz, spokesman for Local Voters in Charge, the campaign backed by the Choctaw Nation in favor of the measure. \u201cBut we are fully confident in the process that brought Issue 2 to the ballot. Arkansas voters have spoken clearly on Issue 2 and we expect it to stand.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Tim Griffin called the lawsuit \u201cbaseless\u201d and said he was prepared to vigorously defend the state.",
      "The proposed amendment removes the Pope County casino\u2019s authorization from the state constitution. It also requires future casino licenses to be approved by voters in the county where it would be located. The constitution currently requires casino license applicants to submit letters of support from local officials.",
      "Cherokee Nation Entertainment has said it plans to build a 50,000-square-foot (4,600-square-meter) casino northeast of Russellville, 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock. Plans also call for a 200-room hotel, a conference center and an outdoor music venue."

      "The spotlight is on Azerbaijan as the small petrostate in the South Caucasus hosts the U.N.\u2019s biggest climate conference.",
      "Diplomats from across the world will descend on the capital Baku for the annual climate summit, known as COP29, to discuss how to avoid increasing threats from climate change in a place that was one of the birthplaces of the oil industry.",
      "It was in Baku where the world\u2019s first oil fields were developed \u202fin 1846 and where Azerbaijan led the world in oil production in 1899.",
      "Sandwiched between Iran to the south and Russia to the north, Azerbaijan is on the Caspian Sea and was part of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1991. Nearly all of Azerbaijan\u2019s exports are oil and gas, two of the world\u2019s leading sources of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. President Ilham Aliyev described them in April as a \u201cgift of the gods.\u201d",
      "Aliyev is Azerbaijan\u2019s authoritarian leader. He is the son of the former president and has been in power for more than two decades, overseeing a crackdown on freedom of speech and civil society. The Associated Press was not granted permission by Azerbaijan's authorities to report in the country ahead of the conference.",
      "Aliyev has said it is a \u201cbig honor\u201d for Azerbaijan to host the conference. He has also said he wants his country to use more renewable energy at home is so that it can export more oil and gas abroad.",
      "In metal cages next to Azerbaijan\u2019s Aquatic Palace sporting venue are pumpjacks \u2014 a sign says they extract just over 2 tons of oil a day. Others pump away elsewhere, sucking up oil in view of one of Baku\u2019s religious and tourist sites, the Bibi Heybat mosque that was rebuilt in the 1990s after it was destroyed by the Bolsheviks almost 80 years ago.",
      "Aliyev said he considers it \u201ca sign of respect\u201d from the international community that Azerbaijan is hosting COP and a recognition of what Azerbaijan is doing around green energy.",
      "Some of those plans involve developing hydropower, solar and wind projects in Karabakh, a region populated by ethnic Armenians who fled to Armenia after a lightning military offensive by Azerbaijan in September 2023.",
      "Aliyev said in a speech in March that his country is in the \u201cactive phase of green transition\u201d but added that \u201cno one can ignore the fact that without fossil fuel, the world cannot develop, at least in the foreseeable future.\u201d",
      "Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan\u2019s environment minister and former vice president at\u202fthe state energy company Socar, will serve as conference president of the talks. Babayev said in April he wants to show how this \u201coil and gas country of the past\u201d can show the world a green path with its efforts to ramp up renewable energy, especially wind power.",
      "He said he believes his country\u2019s COP summit must build on\u202f last year\u2019s agreement \u202fto transition away from fossil fuels and pave the way for countries to come together in 2025 on beefed-up and financed plans to clamp down on heat-trapping gases.",
      "But plenty of people doubt those commitments.",
      "Multiple organizations say Azerbaijan\u2019s commitment to the green energy transition amounts to greenwashing \u2013 giving the impression that the country is doing more than it is to combat climate change.",
      "While many countries including the United States and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 last year\u2019s host \u2014 grapple with the challenges of transitioning away from fossil fuels, Azerbaijan has historically not been proactive in that regard, said Kate Watters, executive director at Crude Accountability, which monitors environmental issues in the Caspian Sea region.",
      "Environmental monitoring in Azerbaijan is dangerous, she said, referencing a crackdown on civil society that has effectively snuffed out any real opposition and seen people detained.",
      "There's no effective mechanism in Azerbaijan for locals to ring alarm bells about exposure to pollutants from the oil and gas industry, Watters said. She referenced health issues such as rashes and sickness that residents may experience living near the Sangachal oil and gas terminal just outside Baku but indicated that their concerns are not heard.",
      "Azerbaijani government officials did not respond to numerous requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Babayev has pointed to Azerbaijan experiencing higher-than-normal temperatures and said he wants states to come together to improve plans to stop the emission of gases that contribute to global warming. But his country has been criticized for failing to clamp down on exactly that.",
      "Analysis from Global Witness, a nonprofit organization, found the volume of gas flared at oil and gas facilities in Azerbaijan increased by 10.5% since 2018.",
      "Gas flaring is a major source of soot, carbon dioxide and methane emissions that contribute to global warming. It happens when energy companies burn off excess gas instead of capturing it when it's released while drilling for oil. It's been blamed by human rights groups and investigative journalists for some of Azerbaijanis' health issues, including around the Sangachal terminal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re heading into a COP where even the host isn\u2019t bothering to do the basic functions of climate diplomacy,\u201d Louis Wilson, head of fossil fuels investigations at Global Witness, told AP.",
      "The Paris climate agreement requires countries to submit plans to combat climate change, with Azerbaijan's latest update coming in 2023. A group of climate scientists rated it \u201ccritically insufficient\u201d in September. It's expected the country will submit an updated plan this year.",
      "Azerbaijan owns one of the largest gas fields in the world, Shah Deniz, and BP announced in April the start of oil production from a new offshore platform also in the Caspian Sea.",
      "Baku is planning to hike its fossil fuel production over the next decade and its natural resources have transformed it into a geopolitical player.",
      "Before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Moscow supplied some of 40% of Europe\u2019s natural gas through four pipelines but most of that was later cut off.",
      "That meant opportunity for Azerbaijan, with the EU striking a deal later that year to double its imports of Azeri gas to 20 billion cubic meters a year by 2027. But there are questions as to whether Azerbaijan can meet that demand and disagreements over the terms of the deal.",
      "\u201cThe more renewable sources we have, the more natural gas we will save,\u201d Aliyev said in March, noting the fuel saved will be \u201can additional contribution to the Southern Gas Corridor,\u201d which takes gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe.",
      "Azerbaijani officials have argued that it is unfair to criticize Baku for producing more fossil fuels when there is a demand for them across Europe as national governments endeavor to keep fuel prices low for citizens.",
      "Azerbaijan\u2019s hosting of COP will turn the spotlight on the nation which makes most of its money from selling fossil fuels but it may also highlight Europe\u2019s \u2014 and the world's \u2014 continuing dependence on them.",
      "For many climate experts, the question for Azerbaijan is whether the country that saw the beginnings of the fossil fuel industry is serious about hosting negotiations focused on moving the world toward green energy.",

    "summary": "A new study says private jet carbon pollution soared 46% from 2019 to 2023",
    "story": [
      "A new study says private jet carbon pollution soared 46% from 2019 to 2023",
      "Carbon pollution from private jets has soared in the past five years, with most of those small planes spewing more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in about two hours of flying than the average person does in about a year, a new study finds.",
      "About a quarter million of the super wealthy \u2014 worth a total of $31 trillion \u2014 last year emitted 17.2 million tons (15.6 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide flying in private jets, according to Thursday's study in the Nature journal Communications Earth & Environment. That's about the same amount as the 67 million people who live in Tanzania,",
      "Private jet emissions jumped 46% from 2019 to 2023, according to the European research team that calculated those figures by examining more than 18.6 million flights of about 26,000 airplanes over five years.",
      "Only 1.8% of the carbon pollution from aviation is spewed by private jets and aviation as a whole is responsible for about 4% of the human-caused heat-trapping gases, the study said.",
      "It may seem like a small amount, but it's a matter of fairness and priorities, said the study's lead author, Stefan Gossling, a transportation researcher at the business school of Sweden's Linnaeus University.",
      "\u201cThe damage is done by those with a lot of money and the cost is borne by those with very little money,\" Gossling said.",
      "The highest emitting private jet user that the team tracked \u2014 but did not identify by name \u2014 spewed 2,645 tons (2,400 metric tons) of carbon dioxide in plane use, Gossling said. That's more than 500 times the global per person average of either 5.2 tons (4.7 metric tons) that the World Bank calculates or the 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) that the International Energy Agency figures and Gossling cites.",
      "\u201cThis report presents further proof that billionaires are causing the climate crisis,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, executive director of the advocacy organization Climate Organizing Hub. \u201cThey are clinging to their private jets and oil profits while regular people see increasing floods, hurricanes and wildfires.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year the International Energy Agency calculated that the world's top 1% of super-emitting people had carbon footprints more than 1,000 times bigger than the globe's poorest 1%.",
      "Gossling's study counted more than 35,600 tons (32,300 metric tons) of carbon pollution from just five global events \u2014 2022\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, 2023\u2019s World Economic Forum, 2023\u2019s Super Bowl, the 2023 Cannes film festival and the 2023 United Nations climate negotiations in Dubai. That came from 3,500 private jet flights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a grim joke that the billionaire class is flying private jets to the annual climate conferences, and the United Nations should crack down on this hypocritical practice,\u201d said Jean Su, energy justice director for the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "Researchers also examined more than 1,200 flights by celebrity actors, singers and directors, but Gossling declined to give the public figures\u2019 names.",
      "Many private flights aren't even for business \u201cnor are they necessary,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThey are very often lifestyle related.\u201d",
      "While the study \u201cdoes shine a bright light on some of the most gluttonous emitters, i.e. the very wealthy,\u201d University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann said the focus shouldn't be on individual behaviors and someone's carbon footprint. He called that \u201ca distraction from the primary task at hand, which is decarbonizing our societal infrastructure through systematic change and policy.\u201d",
      "That's the problem, Gossling said.",
      "\u201cWe have been told for a long time that it is the system that needs to change, not the individual,\u201d Gossling said. \u201cThat has meant that nobody has been responsible for their lifestyles.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem is that the 26,000 aircraft and the individuals using them will say \u2018We are just a small group. We are not relevant in terms of emissions.\u2019 But everybody else will look at the small group and say, 'Look these are the super-emitters, if they are not relevant, how can we be relevant?\u201d Gossling said. \u201cAnd then you have this pointing at each other of two different groups that locks us in a circular argument.\u201d",
      "About 51% of those private jets burn at least 239 gallons of fuel per hour. That's translates to more carbon emissions in two hours and one minute than the IEA's estimate of the average person's yearly 4.7 tons (4.3 metric tons) of pollutants, the study calculated.",
      "\u201cGiven that technology is not going to resolve (climate change), I think the answer is clear. We need to start at the top,\u201d Gossling said.",
      "Gossling said the way to address the high-flying emissions is to charge a tax or landing fee equivalent to the damage done by each ton of emissions. That's about $200 or 200 euros. Westin called for a private jet ban.",
      "The United States is by far the hub of private jets with more than 68% of the globe's private aircraft, about 5 per 100,000 people, the study found. But Gossling said private jets are everywhere, even in poor countries.",
      "In the United States, Alaska has the most private jet flights per person, at nearly 5,000 per 100,000 residents, according to a different study by the student travel company Rustic Pathways.",

      "MILAN -- Italy has opened an administrative procedure against China\u2019s Sinochem, the largest shareholder in Italian tiremaker Pirelli, for a possible breach of restrictions designed to protect national strategic assets.",
      "Pirelli announced Wednesday that the procedure was launched under the so-called \u201cgolden power\u201d provisions, which include restrictions to the access of some information and higher vote thresholds for strategic decisions, invoked by the Rome government in mid-2023.",

      "In announcing the golden power provision, the government cited the sensitivity of sensors implanted in tires that can collect data such as road layouts, geolocation and the state of infrastructure, making it of a \"critical technology of national strategic importance.\u201d",
      "The tiremaker\u2019s second-largest investor is Camfin, the investment vehicle of Pirelli\u2019s former CEO and current executive vice-chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera, which holds a 32.4% stake."

      "When mortgage rates increase they can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, reducing homebuyers\u2019 purchasing power at a time when home prices remain near all-time highs, even though the housing market remains in a sales slump going back to 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds, which lenders use as a guide to price home loans. Bond yields have been rising following encouraging reports on inflation and the economy.",

      "China has announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

Industry leaders are also among those saying that Germany needs a stable government in place soon, as the economy struggles and as Europe prepares for a change of leadership in the United States.",
      "Scholz on Friday said that he's willing to talk about the timing of a vote of confidence and the subsequent new election. He said consultations were taking place with stakeholders, including groups in the German Bundestag and constitutional bodies, in order \u201cto take into account what the others think and mean.\u201d",

      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",

      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",

      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",

      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell."

    "story": [
      "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to limit donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, setting the stage for a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs that spend freely in elections.",
      "In the nation's only campaign finance reform initiative on the ballot on Election Day, residents voted to cap individual donations to super PACs at $5,000. Supporters fully expect a lawsuit that they hope will bring clarity to PAC donations after the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited spending by super PACs.",
      "The measure was carefully crafted to survive legal challenges as states try to find a way to regulate campaign spending after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a supporter of the proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become a place where our democracy is being bought and sold by the richest people in our country,\" said Bennett, a Republican from Oxford. \u201cPeople of all political stripes support this measure. The only people who really oppose this are the monied interests who abuse the system.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court opened the floodgates for big business and labor unions to spend freely on elections in the Citizens United decision, and a Court of Appeals decision three months later lifted limits on individual spending.",
      "The Maine initiative doesn't attempt to limit independent spending on behalf of candidates. It focuses instead on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of Citizens to End Super PACs in Maine, said the goal is to reduce the outsized influence that super PACs currently enjoy through so-called \u201cdark money\u201d spending.",
      "Political nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors and do not have to reveal much about how they spend the donations they receive. A super PAC may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. Its activities must be reported to the Federal Elections Commission but is not otherwise regulated if not coordinated with the candidate or campaign.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to stand up to the big money in politics in Maine. We\u2019re asserting our right to limit the amount of money that someone can give to a super PAC to eliminate not only corruption in our politics but the appearance of corruption in our politics. We think that\u2019s something worth fighting for,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "In Maine, the limit would only apply to PACs spending money on behalf of candidates, not ballot committees involved in referendums. Maine law currently limits contributions to candidates, not PACs. For general elections, individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,950 to a gubernatorial candidate and $475 to a legislative candidate.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, and his Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum. A similar citizen initiative effort in Massachusetts was blocked by the attorney general on constitutional concerns.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Lessig said.",
      "The concern with unlimited individual contributions is the risk of a quid pro quo even when super PACs are spending independently and not coordinating directly with a candidate, Lessig said.",
      "The matter will ultimately have to be decided by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that the U.S. Supreme Court will apply existing jurisprudence that states are free to limit contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue that this case would raise is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d",
      "The Maine law goes into effect this winter, if there is no legal challenge, after an emphatic vote. Nearly 75% of voters supported the citizen initiative."

      "The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey say that recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between the neighboring countries and regional rivals are bearing fruit, although significant differences remain, notably over maritime boundaries...",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously.",
      "Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.",
      "\u201cI am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,\u201d Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions.",
      "\u201cThere were indeed difficult moments during the past year,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cBut in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.\u201d",
      "With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential.",
      "\"We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,\" Fidan said. \"Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.\u201d",
      "Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters.",
      "Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war.",
      "Turkey also doesn\u2019t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law.",
      "Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.",
      "Friday\u2019s talks \u201cincluded the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cIt is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.\u201d",
      "Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled.",
      "\u201cThere are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,\" Fidan said. \"We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d he added.",
      "Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc.",
      "While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks.",
      "The two \u201cemphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,\u201d Fidan said.",

      "Stellantis said Thursday that the Toledo South plant, which makes the Jeep Gladiator midsize pickup truck, will go from two daily shifts to one as early as Jan. 5.",
      "Sales of the Gladiator, the pickup truck version of the Jeep Wrangler SUV, are down nearly 21% so far this year to 36,519, according to Motorintelligence.com.",
      "\u201cThese are difficult actions to take, but they are necessary to enable the company to regain its competitive edge and eventually return production to prior levels,\u201d Stellantis said.",
      "A message was left Thursday seeking comment from the United Auto Workers union, which represents employees at the Toledo plant.",
      "Under the union contract with Stellantis, laid-off workers will get supplemental pay for one year that, when combined with state unemployment benefits, will equal 74% of regular pay. They\u2019ll also get health insurance coverage for two years, Stellantis said.",
      "The move is the latest action by the company as it struggles with high inventory on dealer lots in the U.S. Stellantis' overall sales have been down most of the year in the U.S., and discounts to counter high sticker prices that came after a poor second quarter didn\u2019t work.",
      "In August, the company warned that it could lay off as many as 2,450 of the 3,700 union workers at the pickup truck plant in Warren, Michigan, north of Detroit. It said at the time the number of job cuts will be lower because of early retirement offers.",
      "In the U.S., Stellantis\u2019 dealer inventory ballooned to just over 430,000 vehicles in June. Third-quarter sales fell 20%, and they\u2019re down over 17% for the first nine months. The rest of the auto industry saw sales increase 1% from January through September.",
      "CEO Carlos Tavares said in October that inventory dropped by 52,000 in recent months, and the company is trying to get below 350,000 by Christmas for a \u201cfresh start\u201d going into the new year.",
      "Last month the world's fourth-largest automaker, which was created by the 2021 merger of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, reported a 27% drop in net revenues for the third quarter.",
      "Tavares has been under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union this year, caught off guard by too many high-priced vehicles on dealer lots. Tavares has been trying to cut costs by delaying factory openings, laying off union workers and offering buyouts to salaried employees.",
      "The union is threatening to strike against the company over delays in reopening an assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois, which Stellantis blames on a slowing market."

      "Financial markets worldwide have swung sharply as investors lay bets on what Trump\u2019s plans for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation  could mean for the global economy.

      "Amazon workers in Alabama will have the opportunity decide whether to unionize for the third time in three years",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Amazon workers in Alabama will decide for the third time in three years whether to unionize after a federal judge ruled that the retail giant improperly influenced the most recent vote in which employees rejected a union.",
      "Administrative law judge Michael Silverstein on Tuesday ordered the third vote for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Birmingham, after determining that Amazon committed six violations leading up to the second election in March 2022.",
      "Amazon managers surveilled employees' union activities and threatened workers with plant closure if they voted with the union, Silverstein said in an 87-page decision. Amazon managers also removed pro-union materials from areas where anti-union materials were available, the judge determined.",
      "The National Labor Relations Board also found improper interference in the first election in 2021, leading to the redo in 2022.",
      "Silverstein\u2019s decision comes after months of testimony and is the latest development in a nationwide legal battle involving Amazon, the National Labor Relations Board and unions spearheading unionization efforts. Some states, like California, have fined the mega retailer for labor violations.",
      "Both Amazon and the union that organized the vote in Bessemer said that they would appeal the judge's order.",
      "The president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Stuart Appelbaum, affirmed the court's findings that Amazon broke labor laws.",
      "But he also said that he believed Amazon was likely to commit similar violations in a third election if the court did not order \u201csignificant and meaningful remedies\u201d to protect the vote.",
      "Specifically, the union requested access to private meetings between Amazon representatives and workers, as well as training for Amazon supervisors on labor laws. The judge declined those requests.",
      "\u201cThe record reveals that there are over a hundred managers at BHM1, but my findings of unfair labor practices are limited to four managers, who each committed isolated unfair labor practice,\u201d the judge ruled, referring to the Bessemer facility.",
      "Appelbaum said that the union would appeal that decision.",
      "\u201cAmazon must be held accountable, and we\u2019ll be filing accordingly,\u201d Appelbaum said.",
      "Mary Kate Paradis, a spokesperson for Amazon, said the company vehemently disagreed with the court\u2019s ruling and indicated that there would be an appeal.",
      "\u201cOur team at BHM1 has already made their choice clear, twice that they don\u2019t want a Union. This decision is wrong on the facts and the law,\u201d Paradis said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the NLRB and RWDSU keep trying to force a third vote instead of accepting the facts and the will of our team members.\u201d",
      "With approximately 6,000 employees, Bessemer in 2021 became the largest U.S. facility to vote on unionization in Amazon's over 20-year history. Since then, similar battles have ensued at Amazon facilities across the country.",
      "Workers in Staten Island, New York, successfully voted to unionize in 2022, becoming the first Amazon union in the U.S. But the union has yet to begin bargaining with Amazon amidst legal challenges from the country's second largest employer.",
      "The bid to unionize in Bessemer in particular was always viewed as an uphill battle: Alabama is one of 27 \u201cright-to-work\u201d states where workers don\u2019t have to pay dues to unions that represent them.",
      "Amazon\u2019s sprawling fulfillment center in Bessemer opened in 2020, right as the COVID-19 pandemic began. The city is more than 70% Black, with about a quarter of its residents living in poverty, according to the United States Census.",
      "A vote will likely be delayed until after the court hears anticipated appeals from both parties.",

      "The collapse of Germany\u2019s governing coalition and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s imminent return to the White House are creating new risks for the European Union's biggest economy",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The collapse of Germany's governing coalition and President-elect Donald Trump's imminent return to the White House are creating new risks for the European Union's biggest economy, already in a troubling decline.",
      "Germany's economy has been shrinking for the past two years in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, war in Ukraine and competition from China. Amid both structural problems at home and global challenges, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's fractious three-party coalition failed to find a way forward on some key issues.",
      "The situation came to a head Wednesday night when Scholz announced he was firing Finance Minister Christian Lindner. The move effectively meant the collapse of the chancellor's coalition, which relied on Lindner\u2019s pro-business Free Democratic Party, and left the government bereft of a parliamentary majority.",
      "The coalition's breakdown followed weeks of internal disputes over how to boost Germany's ailing economy.",
      "Scholz said he planned to seek a vote of confidence in parliament on Jan. 15, a move that could lead to an early election by the end of March if he loses. Germany's next regularly scheduled election is not until September. In the meantime, he said he would reach out to opposition leader Friedrich Merz of the center-right Christian Democrats to discuss ideas for strengthening the country's economy and defense.",
      "But business leaders called Thursday for Scholz to act much more quickly to produce a stable government that is poised to tackle the crisis.",
      "\u201cEvery additional day with this federal government is a lost day. We demand new elections as soon as possible,\u201d said Dirk Jandura, president of the German wholesale lobby BGA. \u201cGermany needs an economic turnaround. We have to turn the tide before the waves get too high.\u201d",
      "The coalition's collapse came in the final hours of a day in which European leaders began to digest the certainty of another Trump presidency, which will have serious implications for European security and the economy.",
      "\u201cAt the European level, political instability in Germany is not good news,'' Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the Italian think tank ISPI, said, noting that a strong Franco-German alliance at the center of the European Union provided an important counterweight during Trump's first presidency.",
      "Trump has threatened a withdrawal of NATO commitments and a fundamental shift of support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has also threatened to slap tariffs of up to 20% on goods from the EU, (and even higher tariffs on goods from China), raising the prospect of a trade war with Washington's European allies.",
      "Tariffs would deal a sharp blow to German exports and serve another painful setback to an economy long powered by cheap and plentiful energy from Russia and large export markets.",
      "German industry still has not fully recovered from the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then came Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which led Germany and other Western countries to cut themselves off from Russian gas and oil. Competition from China, including its electric vehicles, has meanwhile forced German and other and European carmakers to lower production and lay off workers.",
      "\u201cPolitical developments over the last 24 hours have further darkened the already bleak short-term outlook for the German economy,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at Dutch banking firm ING, said.",
      "\u201cA second term in office for Donald Trump in the U.S., with the expected new trade tensions, will hit the German economy, which has 10% of its exports going into the U.S.,\" Brzeski said in a note published Thursday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require a lot of imagination to see U.S. tariffs on European cars sending the German automotive industry into deeper problems.\u201d",
      "Other analysts say Trump\u2019s embrace of tariffs might actually benefit Germany\u2019s automobile industry, whose woes have been one of the reasons for the weakening economy. While Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs on European products, President Joe Biden already placed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles vehicles, which are flooding the global market.",
      "\u201cTrump can save the German automotive sector\u201d by keeping the tariffs on Chinese EVs, said Daniel Gros, director of the Institute for European Policymaking at Milan\u2019s Bocconi University. \u201cThe United States is the only market in the world where German carmakers don\u2019t encounter much competition from China.\u201d",
      "Last month, Volkswagen said it planned to close at least three factories in Germany, the first domestic closures in its 87-year history.",
      "\"Some factories will have to close, but perhaps fewer,'' Gros said.",
      "Scholz's firing of the finance minister came after his center-left Social Democrats and the environmentalist, left-leaning Greens had discussed plans for massive state investments. The Free Democrats, however, rejected tax increases or changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed limits on running up debt.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of refusing to find common ground on economic issues, including by publicly calling for what the chancellor said would be tax cuts worth billions for a few top earners while at the same time cutting pensions for all recipients.",
      "\u201cThat is not decent, that is not fair,\u201d Scholz said.",
      "Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck\u2019s Greens and Lindner\u2019s Free Democrats, a party that in recent decades was mostly allied with conservatives, set out in 2021 to form an ambitious, progressive coalition straddling ideological divisions that would modernize Germany.",
      "The government can point to achievements: preventing an energy crunch after Russia cut off its gas supplies to Germany, initiating the modernization of the military and a series of social reforms. But the impression it has left with many Germans is of deepening dysfunction.",
      "\u201cIn view of the global political situation and the poor economic development of Germany as a location, we now need a new, capable government with its own parliamentary majority as quickly as possible,\" said Siegfried Russwurm, president of the Federation of German Industries.",
      "\"With the inauguration of the new U.S. government at the beginning of 2025, uncertainty is expected to increase,\u201d Russwurm said.",

      "The NFL played its first regular-season game in Germany in Munich in 2022, then two games in Frankfurt the following year. Munich is hosting Sunday\u2019s game between the New York Giants and Carolina Panthers, the fifth and last overseas game of the season.",

      "\u201cIt's what the people want, right?\u201d he posed. \"That's normal \u2014 we won a lot. I would just like to have all the squad (available).\u201d",
      "That won't be happening anytime soon considering star center midfielder Rodri, this year's Ballon d'Or winner, is out for the season with an ACL injury. Guardiola also had his best four center backs \u2014 Ruben Dias, John Stones, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake \u2014 unavailable, while playmaker Kevin De Bruyne is clearly not sharp or fit enough on his return from injury.",

      "Indeed, City was dominant in the first half and went in front when Erling Haaland scored his league-leading 12th goal of the campaign.",
      "However, like in the 4-1 loss at Sporting in the Champions League on Tuesday, City couldn't sustain its level in the second half and Brighton fought back, with Joao Pedro equalizing in the 78th and setting up Matt O'Riley for the winner in the 83rd on his Premier League debut.",
      "City's losing run started at Tottenham in the English League Cup last week, before a 2-1 defeat at Bournemouth in the league \u2014 its first league defeat in 11 months.",
      "For Guardiola, it's simple. City's squad cannot cope with all its injuries while the fixtures are coming thick and fast.",

      "City's next game is after the international break, at home to Tottenham in the league.",
      "Liverpool has won nine of its 11 league games in a breathtaking start under new manager Arne Slot, who has got Salah playing in top form.",
      "Salah set up Nunez after a fast breakaway in the 20th minute and scored himself on another counterattack in the 84th for his 10th goal of the season.",
      "\u201cIf you asked me before the season started, I would not say we were candidates,\u201d Liverpool midfielder Alexis Mac Allister said about his team's title chances, \"but now it looks like (we are).\u201d",
      "Liverpool right back Trent Alexander-Arnold went off with a suspected hamstring injury in the first half.",
      "Wolverhampton secured its first win in the league and climbed off the bottom of the standings by beating Southampton 2-0 to ease the pressure on manager Gary O'Neil.",
      "Brazil forward Matheus Cunha set up Pablo Sarabia for a second-minute goal and scored himself in the second half to inspire Wolves at Molineux.",
      "Southampton dropped to last place on its return to the top flight.",
      "Harry Wilson scored another late goal to help Fulham continue its impressive season by winning at 10-man Crystal Palace 2-0.",
      "Wilson's two stoppage-time goals earned Fulham a dramatic win at Brentford on Monday. This time, he built on Emile Smith Rowe's opener by netting in the 83rd minute, after Daichi Kamada was red-carded for Palace. Wilson had another goal ruled out for handball in stoppage time.",
      "Brentford bounced back from that painful loss to Fulham with a 3-2 victory over Bournemouth, thanks to Yoane Wissa's double and a 50th-minute winner from Mikkel Damsgaard.",

      "Miami (9-1, 5-1 Atlantic Coast Conference, No. 4 College Football Playoff) was denied its first 10-0 start since 2017. Georgia Tech (6-4, 4-3) became bowl-eligible and ended a two-game losing streak.",

      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",

      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",

      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",

      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",

      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",

      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d Michael Budkie, the executive director of the group, wrote in the Thursday morning letter."

      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",

      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "Authorities say 43 monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near a fence surrounding the site and that workers are using food to try to recapture them",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Forty-three monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near the site and workers are using food to try to recapture them, authorities said Friday.",
      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",
      "In January 2023, the USDA said temperatures were out of the 45 to 85 degree Fahrenheit (7.2 to 29.5 degree Celsius) required range at some of the compound's monkey cages. The inspection found moldy food in one bin, sharp edges on a gate that could cut an animal and sludge, food waste, used medical supplies, mechanical equipment, and general construction debris on the grounds.",
      "Supporters of medical research involving nonhuman primates said they are critical to lifesaving medical advances like creating vaccines against COVID-19 because of their similarities to people. Keeping a domestic supply of the animals is critical to prevent shortages for U.S. researchers.",
      "Humans have been using the rhesus macaque for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, they kind of represent some of the worst aspects of human nature,\u201d Maestripieri said.",

      "The FBI said it was in touch with the Justice Department on the messages, and the Federal Communications Commission said it was investigating the texts \u201calongside federal and state law enforcement.\u201d The Ohio Attorney General's office also said it was looking into the matter.",
      "Tasha Dunham of Lodi, California, said her 16-year-old daughter showed her one of the messages Wednesday evening before her basketball practice.",
      "The text not only used her daughter's name, but it directed her to report to a \u201cplantation\u201d in North Carolina, where Dunham said they\u2019ve never lived. When they looked up the address, it was the location of a museum.",
      "\u201cIt was very disturbing,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just trying to figure out what does this all mean for me? So, I definitely had a lot of fear and concern.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "Three NASA astronauts whose prolonged space mission ended with a trip to the hospital last month won't say which one of them got sick",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Three NASA astronauts whose prolonged space station mission ended with a trip to the hospital last month declined to say Friday which one of them was sick.",
      "Astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps publicly discussed their spaceflight for the first time since returning from the International Space Station on Oct. 25. They spent nearly eight months in orbit, longer than expected because of all the trouble with Boeing\u2019s Starliner crew capsule and rough weather, including Hurricane Milton.",
      "Soon after their SpaceX capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast, the three were taken to a hospital in nearby Pensacola along with Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin, who launched with them back in March.",
      "One of the Americans ended up spending the night there for an undisclosed \u201cmedical issue.\u201d NASA declined to say who was hospitalized or why, citing medical privacy.",
      "When asked at Friday\u2019s news conference which one had been sick, the astronauts refused to comment. Barratt, a doctor who specializes in space medicine, declined to even describe the symptoms that the unidentified astronaut had.",
      "\u201cSpaceflight is still something we don\u2019t fully understand. We\u2019re finding things that we don\u2019t expect sometimes. This was one of those times and we\u2019re still piecing things together on this,\" said Barratt, the only member of the crew who had flown in space before.",
      "Epps said everyone is different in how they respond to space -- and gravity.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the part that you can\u2019t predict,\" she said, adding, \"Every day is better than the day before.\u201d",
      "Dominick said little things like sitting comfortably in a hard chair took several days to get used to once he returned. He said he didn\u2019t use the treadmill at all during his time in space, as part of an experiment to see what equipment might be pared on a long trip to Mars. The first time he walked was when he got out of the capsule.",
      "The two astronauts who served as test pilots for Boeing's Starliner \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams \u2014 will remain at the space station until February, flying back with SpaceX. Starliner returned empty in September.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 14:50:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.",
      "The request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency's Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency's website.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\" when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "Critics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.",
      "The letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla's stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.",
      "Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "A message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.",
      "In the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner's manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.",
      "But Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla's account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.",
      "\u201cTesla's X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla's postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\"",
      "The postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "On April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \"get to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.",
      "In addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\" and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.",
      "In the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system's ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d",
      "Drivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.",
      "\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "The letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d",
      "The agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.",
      "That means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.",
      "Auto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.",
      "Musk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.",
      "He added that he can't think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said."

      "The explosions in mid-September were widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. The blasts killed at least 37 people, including two children, wounded more than 3,000 and deeply unsettled even Lebanese who have no Hezbollah affiliation.",

      "A small facility in Cyprus is hosting senior government officials from as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders",
      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- From as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia, an assortment of senior government officials converge on this small facility for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders.",
      "In just its third year of operation, the U.S.-funded Cyprus Centre for Land, Open Seas and Port Security (CYCLOPS) has far exceeded expectations. From the dozen courses that officials were initially hoping to hold annually, demand has skyrocketed, with scheduled training sessions for next year expected to surpass 50, says the center\u2019s director Chrysilios Chrysiliou.",
      "So far, over 2,000 officials from 20 countries including Yemen, Libya, Armenia and Ukraine, have received training on radiological and nuclear detection for customs officers, methods of smuggling weapons of mass destruction, and chemical terrorism investigations among a host of other topics.",
      "On Monday, a group of Cypriot and Egyptian officials started a two-day seminar on maritime cybersecurity led by the U.S.-based Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "\u201cThis uniqueness has actually brought ... a lot of success which could not had been foreseen when Cyclops was initially being created,\u201d Chrysiliou told the Associated Press.",
      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "TOKYO -- A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it had survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant was shut down again Monday due to an equipment problem, its operator said.",
      "The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan\u2019s northern coast was put back online on Oct. 29 and had been expected to start generating power in early November.",
      "But it had to be shut down again five days after its restart due to a glitch that occurred Sunday in a device related to neutron data inside the reactor, plant operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said.",
      "The reactor was operating normally and there was no release of radiation into the environment, Tohoku Electric said. The utility said it decided to shut it down to re-examine equipment to address residents' safety concerns. No new date for a restart was given.",
      "The reactor is one of three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation.",
      "The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami triggered by the quake but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns.",
      "All of Japan\u2019s 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 was the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to restart.",
      "Japan's government last year adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy and is pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024. killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. It caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate."

      "NEW YORK -- Shares of Tesla soared Wednesday as investors bet that the electric vehicle maker and its CEO Elon Musk will benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump\u2019s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.",
      "\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a note to investors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players.\u201d",
      "Tesla shares jumped 14.8% Wednesday while shares of rival electric vehicle makers tumbled. Nio, based in Shanghai, fell 5.3%. Shares of electric truck maker Rivian dropped 8.3% and Lucid Group fell 5.3%.",
      "Tesla dominates sales of electric vehicles in the U.S, with 48.9% in market share through the middle of 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Subsidies for clean energy are part of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. It included tax credits for manufacturing, along with tax credits for consumers of electric vehicles.",
      "Musk was one of Trump\u2019s biggest donors, spending at least $119 million mobilizing Trump\u2019s supporters to back the Republican nominee. He also pledged to give away $1 million a day to voters signing a petition for his political action committee.",
      "In some ways, it has been a rocky year for Tesla, with sales and profit declining through the first half of the year. Profit did rise 17.3% in the third quarter.",
      "The U.S. opened an investigation into the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system after reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian. The investigation covers roughly 2.4 million Teslas from the 2016 through 2024 model years.",
      "And investors sent company shares tumbling last month after Tesla unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi at a Hollywood studio Thursday night, seeing not much progress at Tesla on autonomous vehicles while other companies have been making notable progress.",

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too",
      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 15:38:31 -0500",
    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 3, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 5, 2024 to correct that TV sizes are measured on the diagonal, not by width.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s privacy watchdog on Tuesday fined social media company Meta 21.6 billion won ($15 million) for illegally collecting sensitive personal information from Facebook users, including data about their political views and sexual orientation, and sharing it with thousands of advertisers.",
      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",
      "South Korea\u2019s privacy law provides strict protection for information related to personal beliefs, political views and sexual behavior, and bars companies from processing or using such data without the specific consent of the person involved.",
      "The commission said Meta amassed sensitive information by analyzing the pages the Facebook users liked or the advertisements they clicked on.",
      "The company categorized ads to identify users interested in themes such as specific religions, same-sex and transgender issues, and issues related to North Korean escapees, said Lee Eun Jung, a director at the commission who led the investigation on Meta.",
      "\u201cWhile Meta collected this sensitive information and used it for individualized services, they made only vague mentions of this use in their data policy and did not obtain specific consent,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee also said Meta put the privacy of Facebook users at risk by failing to implement basic security measures such as removing or blocking inactive pages. As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",
      "In September, European regulators hit Meta with over $100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form.",

      "The commission said then that the two companies didn\u2019t clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an \u201ceasy and clear\u201d consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump scored a comprehensive victory Tuesday, improving his numbers across several key demographics. Can other Republicans do the same?",
    "story": [
      "\"Love him or hate him, Trump is a generational candidate,\" one Republican said.",
      "Donald Trump scored a comprehensive victory Tuesday, improving his numbers across several key demographics, possibly sweeping every swing state and clinching the popular vote, which no Republican had done since 2004.",
      "The president-elect, however, says he has run his last race. Term limits will bar him from running again in four years, and Republicans will need to show similar strength in 2026 to maintain their Senate majority and key House seats they were able to secure this year, not to mention the White House again in 2028.",
      "Yet Trump remains a singular figure in Republican politics, and while some lawmakers have been able to find success with their own coalitions, past Trump emulators have failed to capture the same kind of appeal across the political spectrum that he holds -- an appeal that appears to be the dominant force in the modern GOP.",
      "When asked by ABC News whether Trump's coalition can be replicated by others, more than a half-dozen Republican operatives responded with one answer: a resounding maybe.",
      "\"Love him or hate him, Trump is a generational candidate,\" said Tricia McLaughlin, a GOP strategist who worked on Vivek Ramaswamy's presidential campaign. \"That is something in the next three years we have to grapple with.\"",
      "\"I think we're yet to see who that might be,\" she added of who can emulate Trump's 2024 path, \"and I think part of the reason we might not be able to see who that is now, and it might take us a while, is because Donald Trump is the name of the game.\"",
      "The thoroughness of Trump's win left Democrats scratching their heads and gave Republicans a path forward beyond his final term in office, if they're able to capitalize on it.",
      "He appeared on track to take all seven swing states, while staying competitive in deep blue states like New Mexico and New Jersey. He was able to clinch 46% of the Latino vote, won Hispanic men outright and kept his loss to single digits among female voters even amid furor over abortion access, according to exit poll data. And while he expanded the Republican coalition to include more voters of color, he maintained his dominance with white voters.",
      "Now, it's contingent on Republicans, likely with Trump's support, to continue those successes as they work to defend their new Senate majority in 2026, remain competitive for the House and elect another president in four years.",
      "One way, strategists said, is to try to be as legislatively productive as possible while Trump is in the White House. He was elected to change things, they argued, and making those changes will help reinforce the perception of the Republican Party that handed the GOP victories up and down the ballot, benefiting others hitting the campaign trail in their own races.",
      "\"This is not a squeaker of a win, it's a landslide, he has a mandate on the policies he's running on. So, it would be wise for our party to achieve all of that sooner than later, in the first 100 days for Congress to get that together,\" said GOP strategist Kristin Davison. \"To keep the coalition, the first step is to deliver.\"",
      "\"And then, moving forward, we have four years here, and elections during that time and following, to take that message that meets voters where they are,\" Davison added. \"I think where we might make a mistake is where candidates copy and paste. Nobody will be able to be Trump\u2026But to take that message and apply it to their specific state and district and community will be the best way to continue and grow that.\"",
      "To do so, Republican candidates might have to break from traditional GOP orthodoxy in the same way that Trump did. Out are support for free trade and big business benefits, in are \"fair trade\" and policies beneficial to workers.",
      "\"I think it's important to remember that this coalition is built on policy over anything else. Yes, personality helps him build it. But the policy is what builds this coalition,\" said Nick Trainer, a former Trump administration official. \"You have to find your way in, whether that's increased child tax credits or pro-labor stances or whatever it may be, you have to find your way into it. But it's not something where you can be a PowerPoint Republican of yesteryear.\"",
      "It won't be easy.",
      "Past emulators have failed. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential bid flamed out as Trump remained the party leader, and Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is trailing in a state that favored Trump.",
      "Trump has undoubtedly brought more voters into the fold, including some who are thought to not be motivated to vote for anyone besides him. And if there is any hope of Trump's coalition living on in other races, his involvement could be key.",
      "\"There's this fascinating voter out there that is uniquely keyed for Donald Trump, and we may never see them again. They may never vote again in their lives, because I'm convinced that a lot of them never voted before Donald Trump,\" said one GOP strategist who worked on several down-ballot races this year.",
      "\"How do we keep them engaged? How do we keep them motivated to keep coming around?\" the person added. \"I don't know, but that would be one way to replicate it, is if he took an active role in kind of playing kingmaker from this point forward.\"",
      "To be certain, there are other coalitions to be had.",
      "GOP governors like Mike DeWine in Ohio and Brian Kemp in Georgia have won as more traditional Republican lawmakers, at times with margins even more expansive than those Trump won in their states.",
      "But Trump and his coalition are clearly the 800-pound gorilla in Republican politics, and while replicating the president-elect's appeal will be key to Republican success, doing so won't come as naturally to others.",
      "\"It will be extremely difficult,\" the Republican strategist said. \"Doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Doesn't mean that there won't be efforts to do it. But I do think there will be a limit to how successful you're going to be without your name being Donald Trump.\"",

That's why we do things like publish ratings of pollster accuracy and transparency and make complex election forecasting models to explore what would happen if the polls are off by as much as they have been historically.",
      "Polls are also important for the reporting we do here at 538, which is rooted in empiricism and data. Furthermore, the quality of the data we're getting about public opinion is important not just for predicting election outcomes and doing political journalism, but also for many other parts of our democratic process.",
      "Suffice it to say, if polls are getting more or less accurate, the public needs to know. And now that the 2024 election is in the rearview mirror, we can take a rough first look at how accurate polling was.",
      "Just one note on scope before we get started: In this article, I will be taking just a broad look at how polls did in states where the results are final or nearly final. That means we won't assess the accuracy of national polls yet, given how many votes are still left to count in California and other slow-counting states, and won't be assessing the accuracy of individual pollsters, which we'll do when we update our pollster ratings next spring.",
      "Polls in 2024: Low error, medium bias",
      "Despite the early narrative swirling around in the media, 2024 was a pretty good year to be a pollster. According to 538's analysis of polls conducted in competitive states* in which over 95 percent of the expected vote was counted as of Nov. 8 at 6 a.m. Eastern, the average poll conducted over the last three weeks of the campaign missed the margin of the election by just 2.94 percentage points. In the seven main swing states (minus Arizona, which is not yet at 95 percent reporting), pollsters did even better: They missed the margin by just 2.2 points.",
      "This measure, which we call \"statistical error,\" measures how far off the polls were in each state without regard for whether they systematically overestimated support for one candidate. And by this metric, state-level polling error in 2024 is actually the lowest it has been in at least 25 years. By comparison, state-level polls in 2016 and 2020 had an average error close to 4.7 percentage points. Even in 2012, which stands out as a good year for both polling and election forecasting, the polls missed election outcomes by 3.2 percentage points.",
      "At this early juncture, we can only speculate as to why error was so low this year. One reason could be that pollsters have mostly moved away from conducting polls using random-digit dialing \u2014 a type of polling that has recently tended to generate results that oscillate more wildly from poll to poll than other methods. One notable pollster that does still use RDD is Selzer & Co., which had Vice President Kamala Harris leading President-elect Donald Trump by 3 points in its final poll of Iowa this year. Trump ended up winning the state by about 13 points, making for a 16-point error. It looks possible that Selzer's poll had too many Democrats and college-educated voters in it, factors the firm generally does not attempt to correct for due to Selzer's philosophy of \"keeping [her] dirty hands off the data\" (to be fair, this approach had worked excellently until this year; Selzer is one of the top-rated pollsters in 538's pollster ratings).",
      "Quinnipiac University, which also uses RDD, also generated polls that didn't seem consistent across states, though they ended up being closer to the outcome than Selzer. Meanwhile, other prominent pollsters that previously used RDD have now stopped using the method. That includes ABC News, which, after publishing an RDD poll that found now-President Joe Biden ahead of Trump by 17 points in Wisconsin in 2020 (something the pollsters behind the survey rightly identified as an outlier result when it was published), now sources its polls from Ipsos, which conducts polls online among respondents who are randomly recruited by mail and telephone.",
      "Another factor is that pollsters are increasingly balancing their samples on both demographic and political variables, such as individuals' recalled vote in the last election. While this can cause some strange results, it generally stabilizes the polls and produces fewer outliers than one would expect by random chance alone.",
      "Based on our preliminary findings, pollsters that used this aggressive approach to modeling had lower error than others. While this is just a loose proxy as we conduct a more thorough analysis, we found that pollsters who conducted their surveys with online probability panels, interviewed people with robo-calls, or included text messages or phone calls as part of a bigger mixed-mode sampling design tended to use more complex weighting schemes (and were especially reliant on recalled vote) \u2014 and also had lower error than pollsters using more hands-off modes:",
      "But the news is not all good. While polls had a historically good year in terms of error, they had a medium-to-bad one in terms of statistical bias, which measures whether polls are missing the outcome in the same direction. By our math, state polls overestimated support for Harris by an average of 2.7 points on margin in competitive states.",
      "That's lower than the statistical bias of the polls in 2016 and 2020, which underestimated Trump by 3.2 and 4.1 points, respectively. But it's higher than the bias in the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections.",
      "This is not great news for pollsters. It means they did not fully solve their problems from 2016 and 2020 of getting enough Trump supporters to take their polls . While those problems may have been abated by pollsters weighting their data more aggressively or improving their sampling designs, they are still obviously present. You can really see this if you look at the pattern of polling bias in the competitive states from 2016 to 2024:",
      "While pollsters managed to reduce their bias in some states, especially Wisconsin, from 2020 to 2024, the pattern in the industry is still the same: Pollsters are having a hard time reaching the types of people who support Trump.",
      "You should expect errors in polling",
      "While bias in the polling industry is troubling, it is not necessarily unexpected \u2014 especially after the last few elections. And it's worth repeating that a 3-point error on the margin is indeed very small historically. Political pollsters have designed a tool that, on average, can measure public opinion among hundreds of millions of people to within 1.5 percent of its \"true\" value (converting vote margin to vote share). When you think about it that way, it's actually remarkable that polls are as accurate as they are.",
      "After the 2020 election, a year in which America's pollsters faced their worst performance since 1980, the American Association of Public Opinion Research (the professional society for pollsters and survey researchers) issued a warning to people trying to predict election outcomes in 2022 and 2024. \"Polls are often misinterpreted as precise predictions,\" it said. \"It is important in pre-election polling to emphasize the uncertainty by contextualizing poll results relative to their precision.... Most pre-election polls lack the precision necessary to predict the outcome of semi-close contests.\"",
      "In other words, polls are simply not up to the task of dispositively determining the result of a close race before it happens. In such a case, the margin between candidates would be too small for observers to conclude that one candidate was reliably ahead, given the inherent uncertainty in polling.",
      "Let's put this note of caution in the context of the 2024 election. At first glance, it may seem like polls had a bad year because they pointed to a close election and Trump looks like he will cruise to a 312-226 win in the Electoral College. But as I wrote last week, because he led in the Sun Belt swing states and was tied in Pennsylvania, polls didn't really even need to underestimate Trump at all for him to win the election. And, I warned, if they underestimated him by 2 points \u2014 which would be small compared to other misses historically \u2014 he could sweep all seven swing states.",
      "Well, it looks like that is exactly what happened. In fact, it was the modal outcome in our final forecast. AAPOR's warning is more relevant today than ever.",

      "According to June 2024 data from U.N. Women, \"113 countries worldwide have never had a woman serve as Head of State or Government.\" This means that among the 193 United Nations member states, at least 80 countries have had a female head of state or government.",

      "\"I'm clearly a woman, I don't need to point that out to anyone,\" she said. \"The point that most people really care about is, can you do the job, and do you have a plan to actually focus on them?\"",

      "She also blasted Bernie Sanders in an interview with The New York Times.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in portions of a New York Times podcast interview published Friday, blamed Vice President Kamala Harris' election loss on President Joe Biden's late exit from the presidential race and the lack of Democratic primary.",
      "Pelosi told Lulu Garcia-Navarro, a host of \"The Interview,\" that \"had the president [Biden] gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\" the paper said in a story about the Thursday interview. The exchange won't be posted in full until Saturday.",
      "\"The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary,\" Pelosi said.",
      "\"And as I say, Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward. But we don't know that. That didn't happen. We live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different,\" she added.",
      "As ABC News has reported, Pelosi worked behind the scenes to urge Biden to drop out of the presidential race following his performance at CNN's debate.",
      "Back in November 2022, when ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Pelosi, \"do you think President Biden should run again?\" she answered, \"Yes, I do. I mean President Biden has been a great president for our country. He has accomplished so much.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 20:41:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite concerns about the future of the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights, health care was not a major voting issue in this election, experts tell ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of abortion rights ballot initiatives also voted for Trump.",
      "Americans who voted to elect Donald Trump the 47th president in Tuesday night's election expressed concerns about several major issues, including the state of democracy, the economy, immigration and foreign policy.",
      "The state of democracy in particular was the most important issue to voters, with 35% saying as much according to an ABC News preliminary exit poll, followed by 31% who said the economy was the most important issue to them.",
      "Health care, however, did not seem to be a major voting issue for many Americans. Though abortion, for example, was among the top five voting issues, only 14% said it was their most important issue, the exit poll showed.",
      "Experts told ABC News that despite concerns about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and further restrictions on abortion rights, other issues were top of mind for Americans.",
      "\"Health care issues are always a concern to people, but certainly there were other issues that were more important to people at this time,\" Dr. Perry Halkitis, dean of the School of Public Health at Rutgers University in New Jersey, told ABC News. \"It seemed like the economy and migration were the biggest issues, but especially the economy. People expressed very serious concerns about prices, very serious concerns about the affordability of things, very serious concerns about inflation.\"",
      "\"And those surpassed concerns about health care access and or reproductive rights, and many people voted based on their pocketbooks instead of their health care rights and access,\" Halkitis continued.",
      "Affordable Care Act",
      "During his first term, then-President Trump tried several times to repeal the ACA but was unsuccessful. He was promising as late November 2023 to replace it, saying Republicans \"should never give up\" trying.",
      "However, throughout 2024, Trump said on several occasions, both on social media and during the presidential debate, that he wanted to make the ACA \"better\" rather than replace it.",
      "Ultimately, worries about heath care and potential changes to the ACA didn't even crack the top five voting issues in ABC News exit polls.",
      "Halkitis said he doesn't think there will be radical changes to the ACA during Trump's second term because it's \"baked into people's lives.\" However, he does worry about legislation or policies that could limit the types of services that are available from health care providers, as opposed to a complete repeal or dismantling of the ACA.",
      "\"One example is that in the state of Texas, about a year ago, the district court decided that the pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is the use of one pill once a day to prevent HIV, did not have to be covered by insurance of a particular company,\" Halkitis said. \"I think things like that that speak to people's beliefs, whether correct or incorrect, [that] may affect the kinds of health care services that are provided to people, if the president-elect is to make any changes to the Affordable Care Act.\"",
      "Another example is the federal contraceptive coverage guarantee. Under a provision of the ACA, most private insurance plans must cover the full cost of most contraceptives, such as birth control, without making patients pay out-of-pocket costs.",
      "If the incoming Trump administration allows employers and schools to use religious and moral exemptions to prevent coverage of contraceptives, as the White House did during Trump's first term, this may lead to out-of-pocket costs that make contraceptives unaffordable to some, some experts told ABC News.",
      "Also at risk could be those with preexisting conditions. Under the ACA, insurers cannot charge more or deny coverage to someone or their child because of a preexisting health condition. However, Vice President-elect JD Vance has suggested placing people with chronic conditions into separate risk pools, which could raise premiums for those with preexisting conditions.",
      "\"I hope that doesn't happen because that would actually be disastrous for so many millions of Americans,\" Halkitis said. \"What I think would happen is that, if they were to modify the preexisting conditions clause, and put the people in a different bracket, is that it may become unaffordable for people to have health insurance.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, professor and chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Georgia, said he thinks voters in future elections will be motivated to go to the polls if they see modifications to the ACA.",
      "For example, Patrick said public opinion is generally favorable for provisions such as parents being able to keep their children on their insurance plans until age 26, as a 2019 KFF Health Tracking Poll found, which may have inspired people to go to the polls in past elections.",
      "\"We know that as you start to make modifications to things like the Affordable Care Act, people do care as we start to modify things, or change things when it affects their health insurance,\" Patrick told ABC News. \"If you say to someone, 'keeping your kid on your health insurance until they're 26,' people generally are in favor of those types of policies.\"",
      "Reproductive rights",
      "Some political strategists believed that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overruling Roe v. Wade would drive voters who support abortion rights to the polls to vote for Kamala Harris. Trump himself took credit for the ruling, boasting that he \"was able to kill Roe v. Wade.\"",
      "While supporters of legal abortion still broke strongly for Harris, Trump's approach focusing on states' rights appeared to resonate with voters who didn't view abortion access as incompatible with a Trump presidency.",
      "In Arizona, 23% who voted \"yes\" on the state's initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution also voted for Trump. In Nevada, where another abortion-rights measure was approved, 25% of \"yes\" voters likewise went for Trump, according to the ABC News exit poll.",
      "\"I think what we're seeing [in] the exit polls is that abortion was a very important issue among many, many voters. However, those voters did not all vote for Kamala Harris,\" Dr. Leslie Kantor, professor and chair of the Department of Urban Global Public Health at the Rutgers School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"I think that there was actually a certain amount of confusion, which was sown pretty deliberately by the Trump-Vance campaign in the final weeks, trying to convince people that, in fact, they don't oppose abortion, when the track record clearly shows that they do.\"",
      "Kantor said this is evident in statements by Trump and Vance in which they said the president-elect would veto a national abortion ban if it came across his desk, or in comments by Trump in which he said he would not use the 150-year-old Comstock Act to ban mail delivery of abortion medication.",
      "Kantor noted that, despite Trump expressing pride for appointing justices to the Supreme Court to overrule Roe v. Wade, he was less vocal about abortion rights on the campaign trail.",
      "\"In 2024, when people are seeing the devastating consequences of the overturn [sic] of Roe v. Wade, he really backed away from that position and was much less clear, and voters were clearly less clear,\" she said. \"Because when you see somebody who says, 'I think abortion should be legal in most cases,' and then voting for somebody who clearly does not believe abortion should be legal, you know that people have been confused.\"",
      "Preliminary exit poll results from ABC News show that abortion was an important voting issue for young women, with about 19% of all women voters saying it was their most important issue, rising to 42% among women younger than 30.",
      "Kantor further noted that she thinks young women are scared after reading news reports about women pushed to the brink of death or dying after medical care was denied because physicians were hesitant to act due to restrictions to state abortion laws. She added that some abortion care providers are also leaving states where abortion care is restricted.",
      "\"Young women are terrified about what's happening all around the country,\" Kantor said. \"The truth is it isn't even safe to have a wanted pregnancy in this country. \u2026So, I think young women are staring at 30 years, possibly 25 years, of having to manage their sexual and reproductive health with very few providers and very few rights.\"",
      "It may be difficult to access abortion services even in states where care is now legal. In Missouri, voters enshrined the right to reproductive freedom in the state's constitution, effectively ending the state's restrictive ban. However, abortion for now remains unavailable in the state.",
      "\"Access to services is incredibly restricted and, at some point, having a right is meaningless if you can't actually get the service,\" Kantor said.",

      "The exception, of course, was inflation, and it appears to have overshadowed other indicators. More than two-thirds of voters say the economy is in bad shape, according to the preliminary results of an ABC News exit poll.",
      "Inflation likely shaped negative voter perceptions of the economy and helped fuel anger toward the party in power, just as it has done across the globe since the pandemic unleashed a wave of rapid price increases, experts told ABC News.",
      "The political potency of inflation stems from the visceral, recurring sense of unease caused by high prices, experts added. That feeling leaves voters insecure about their future and desperate for a leader who can change the nation\u2019s course.",
      "\u201cInflation has a specific and special power in elections,\u201d Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs for Ipsos in the U.S., told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s something people see in their face every day -- every time they go to the grocery store or fill up their car.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cInflation is present in people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s something they\u2019re unhappy with and it\u2019s something they rightly or wrongly blame on whoever is in charge.\u201d",
      "The pandemic set off an acute bout of inflation that impacted nearly every country across the world, when global supply chain blockages caused an imbalance between the availability of goods and the demand for them. In other words, too much money chased too few products.",
      "Prices began to rise rapidly in the U.S. in 2021, catapulting the inflation rate to a peak of about 9% the following year. Inflation soared even higher in many other countries, including the likes of Brazil and England, where leaders faced an angry electorate.",
      "In Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro cut taxes on fuel and electricity in an effort to slash prices over the months preceding an election that concluded in October 2022, the nation nevertheless replaced him with a leftwing challenger.",
      "Earlier that year, in England, Prime Minister Liz Truss responded to the highest inflation in four decades with an economic policy centered on tax cuts and energy price controls. Her tenure in office lasted just 44 days before market reaction and political disarray led to her stepping down.",
      "The post-pandemic pattern has exemplified a high rate of leadership change amid inflation crises around the world over the last half century, according to a study by Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy firm. Examining 57 inflation shocks since 1970, the firm found government turnover in 58% of cases.",
      "Further, when there was an election during or within two years of an inflation shock, it led to a change in government in roughly three out of every four instances, according to Eurasia Group.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this trend on jet fuel after the pandemic,\u201d said Robert Kahn, the managing director of global macro-geoeconomics at the New York-based Eurasia Group. \u201cThe pandemic inflation shock contributes to a sense of instability and a loss of confidence among people in their governments.\u201d",
      "Carola Binder, an economics professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the history of inflation in the U.S., characterized recent anti-incumbent sentiment in a slightly different way: \u201cWhen people are experiencing inflation and suffering from it, they want to have someone or something to blame.\u201d",
      "Inflation has cooled dramatically over the past two years, now hovering near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%. Even so, that progress hasn't reversed a leap in prices that dates back to the pandemic. Since President Joe Biden took office in 2021, consumer prices have skyrocketed more than 20%.",
      "The potential role of inflation in the U.S. election owes to a typical lag between when inflation comes down and when consumers acclimate to new price levels, since a lower inflation rate does not mean prices have come down but rather that they have begun to increase at a slower pace, experts told ABC News.",
      "\u201cWhen inflation comes back down, the prices of many critical items remain high, especially for people who are stretched and living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Kahn said.",
      "Consumers will likely acclimate to current price levels over the coming months, but voters will remain sensitive to inflation, experts said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposals of heightened tariffs and the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants risk rekindling rapid price increases, some experts said.",
      "When asked about whether inflation could reemerge as an important issue ahead of the next midterm elections in 2026, Jackson said: \u201cIf Republicans shoot themselves in the foot, absolutely.\u201d",

      "The standoff carries high stakes for the U.S. economy, experts said.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a defiant tone this week when posed with the question of whether he would resign from his position if asked by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Powell said, pausing to let the one-word answer register with the reporters assembled at a press conference in Washington, D.C., blocks away from the White House. When asked whether Trump could fire or demote him, Powell retorted: \u201cNot permitted under the law.\u201d",
      "Prominent Trump allies responded within hours. \u201cThe Executive Branch should be under the direction of the president,\u201d Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah posted on X atop a screenshot of Powell\u2019s comments. Lee added: \u201cYet another reason why we should #EndTheFed.\u201d",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, a top Trump donor, reposted the message from Lee with an emoji appended, indicating Musk\u2019s full support.",
      "The high-stakes standoff has elicited questions about what Trump could do to overcome the Fed\u2019s longstanding independence, whether such maneuvers could prove effective and what it may mean for everyday Americans.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know, according to experts:",
      "What could Trump do to meddle with the Federal Reserve?",
      "The Federal Reserve Act, which founded the central bank in 1913, granted the central bank a measure of independence from the White House.",
      "In actuality, however, the Fed has only enjoyed independence since the early 1950s, when the central bank did away with a policymaking role taken up by the Treasury Department.",
      "Federal law allows the president to remove a Federal Reserve governor, including the Fed chair, \u201cfor cause.\u201d",
      "Experts who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that some legal ambiguity looms over what type of conduct warrants sufficient cause for removal, but they said a policy dispute is unlikely to meet such a standard. Still, Trump could attempt to push out Powell and test how courts interpret the law, experts added, noting that the case could end up with the conservative-majority Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTrump could try and he might try,\u201d Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that he has that authority, but if he takes this to the Supreme Court, I don\u2019t know what to think of the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Instead, Trump could leave Powell in his position on the Fed\u2019s 7-member Board of Governors but demote him from his role as chair, Blinder said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a subtle question that has never been tested,\u201d Blinder said, acknowledging a lack of clarity about whether it would be allowed. \u201cWe can\u2019t answer that quite as definitively.\u201d",
      "If the courts reject Trump or he wants a sure path to the removal of Powell, Trump could push Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act in a manner that weakens or eliminates the Fed\u2019s independence, experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Congress\u2019s prerogative,\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something written at the top of Mount Sinai.\u201d",
      "As he did on numerous occasions over his first term, Trump could also try to influence Fed policy through public criticism of the central bank in general and Powell in particular, experts said.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least [a] say in there,\" Trump said about interest rate policy during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in August.",
      "Could Trump successfully influence interest rate decisions, and why does it matter?",
      "Experts cast doubt on the prospect of Trump meaningfully influencing the Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions, at least in the short term.",
      "The attempted removal of Powell would likely get tied up in the courts for months, if not years, while an effort to pass new legislation would face steep odds in the Senate, where it would need to overcome a 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome a filibuster, the experts said.",
      "Powell would likely resist a campaign of public pressure undertaken by Trump, just as Powell did the first time around, experts added.",
      "Trump would also face a potentially steep decline in the stock market if he appeared to seriously threaten the independence of the Fed, some experts said. Bank executives and other business leaders would likely voice stiff opposition, fearing economic instability and runaway inflation, they added.",
      "\u201cTrying to overcome Fed independence would be highly disruptive,\u201d said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital and co-author of \u201cThe Myth of Independence: How Congress Governs the Federal Reserve.\u201d \u201cI think the market would be an important consideration in all these efforts.\u201d",
      "Trump, however, could simply wait for his opportunity to appoint loyal personnel at the central bank, according to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed official. In 2026, Powell\u2019s term will expire and Trump will appoint a replacement, who will then require Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cFrankly, the easy thing is to wait a year and nominate someone else,\u201d Sahm said.",
      "The status of Fed independence holds important stakes for everyday people, Sahm added. A central bank that lacks independence is more likely to throw its dual mandate of stable inflation and maximum employment out of whack, since politicians tend to prioritize short-term economic performance over long-term steadiness, Sahm said.",
      "\u201cIf you have a central bank that does what the president wants instead of what the economy needs, then we can end up with high inflation, high unemployment and financial instability,\u201d Sahm said.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana lawmakers advanced bills to flatten the state's income tax rate and repeal the corporate franchise tax in a special legislative session focused on a sweeping tax reform package championed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry.",
      "The session started earlier this week and the bills quickly cleared committees despite pushback from Democratic lawmakers and groups such as those representing the film industry, which are set to lose tax breaks. The state House of Representatives could vote on the bills early next week.",
      "One of the bills would introduce a flat individual income tax rate of 3% while increasing deductions for the lower income brackets. The legislative fiscal office's former chief economist Greg Albrecht described the proposed income tax plan as \u201cmodestly progressive\u201d compared to the existing tax code in a study commissioned by a coalition of nonpartisan policy think tanks.",
      "Democratic Rep. Matthew Willard, the state House Minority Leader, said on Thursday that the income tax cuts would do little to help lower-income households. Citing Albrecht's study, he noted that people earning between $25,000 to $30,000 annually would only get back $224 as a result of the proposed reforms.",
      "\u201cAlthough this plan saves everybody money, the majority of people who truly benefit from it don't need much financial help and the people who do need financial help are saving $200, $300 a year \u2014 but they need $1,000,\u201d said Willard, a member of the House Ways and Means committee.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the bigger picture, I mean really how you improve the lot of everybody, especially on the lower income brackets, is you get them a better job and I think you give them more opportunity,\u201d said Richard Nelson, Secretary of the Department of Revenue and the architect of the governor's tax reform proposals.",
      "If approved, the flat income tax rate would leave the state with an estimated revenue hole of more than $1 billion, which Landry's proposal calls for making up for primarily by expanding sales tax on dozens of services and digital goods such as streaming sites \u2014 likely a harder sell for the GOP-dominated Legislature moving forward.",

      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",

      "The vote came at the end of a lengthy and tumultuous public comment period and questioning from city councilmembers, during which several people were thrown out of council chambers. McDonnell\u2019s appointment was heavily opposed by immigration advocates, who say he allowed federal authorities to operate freely while he was sheriff and shared information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",

That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do.\u201d",

      "Dallas Jerome Nicholas Medina, 32, of Ravenna, Ohio, was originally indicted on a felony intimidation charge, but pleaded guilty on Oct. 31 in Albemarle County Circuit Court to a reduced charge of misdemeanor disorderly conduct and will not serve any jail time, The Daily Progress reported.",
      "\u201cIt seemed like a reasonable outcome for everybody, a reasonable compromise,\u201d Medina\u2019s lawyer, Mike Hallahan, told The Daily Progress after the hearing.",
      "Medina\u2019s case is among more than a dozen stemming from an event on Aug. 11, 2017. That\u2019s when a group of white nationalists carrying torches marched through the campus of the University of Virginia, some chanting, \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201d He was the fourth participant to enter a plea deal.",
      "In addition to the four misdemeanor pleas, six people have been convicted of felonies and one case ended with a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a verdict.",
      "Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Lawton Tufts, who prosecuted Medina, said in court that three factors warranted the lesser charge: he had no prior criminal record, he was not accused of assaulting anyone and he helped stop a fight.",
      "When asked if he wanted to comment, Medina was reticent.",
      "\u201cI got to go home,\u201d he told The Daily Progress. \u201cSorry.\u201d"

      "Voter rights groups have petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with their mail-in ballots",
      "PHOENIX -- Voter rights groups on Saturday petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with their mail-in ballots following delays in vote counting and notifying voters about problems.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and the Campaign Legal Center asked the state's high court in an emergency petition that the original 5 p.m. Sunday deadline be extended up to four days after a voter is sent notice of a problem.",
      "The groups argued in the petition that \u201ctens of thousands of Arizonans stand to be disenfranchised without any notice, let alone an opportunity to take action to ensure their ballots are counted.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause these ballots have not even been processed, Respondents have not identified which ballots are defective and have not notified voters of the need to cure those defects,\u201d the petition stated.",
      "Arizona law says people who vote by mail should receive notice of problems with their ballots, such as a signature that doesn\u2019t match the one on file, and get a chance to correct it in a process known as \u201ccuring.\u201d",
      "The groups' petition noted that as of Friday evening more than 250,000 mail-in ballots had not yet been verified by signature. The bulk of them were in Arizona's most populous county, Maricopa County.",
      "Just under 200,000 early ballots remained to be processed as of Saturday, according to estimates on the Arizona Secretary of State\u2019s Office website.",
      "Taylor Kinnerup, a spokesperson for the Maricopa County Recorder's Office, said it takes pride in conducting \u201caccurate and timely\u201d signature verification, and that all signatures for the general election went through the process by the end of the day Friday, \u201cgiving voters with questioned signatures ample time to cure their signature.\u201d",

    "summary": "Democratic incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen won reelection early Saturday morning after The Associated Press declared she had beat Republican Sam Brown in a race that turned on Rosen&rsquo;s strong performance in the state&rsquo;s two largest counties &mdash; Clark and Washoe",
    "story": [
      "Democratic incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen won reelection early Saturday morning after The Associated Press declared she had beat Republican Sam Brown in a race that turned on Rosen\u2019s strong performance in the state\u2019s two largest counties \u2014 Clark and Washoe",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen won reelection early Saturday morning after The Associated Press declared she had beat Republican Sam Brown in a race that turned on Rosen's strong performance in the state's two largest counties \u2014 Clark and Washoe.",
      "With nearly all of the vote counted, the AP called the race for Rosen.",
      "At the time the AP called the race at 12:15 a.m. ET on Saturday, there were not enough votes left to count, according to AP's estimates, in the state's rural areas to make up the gap created by Rosen's performance in the counties that are home to Las Vegas and Reno.",
      "Rosen was one of several vulnerable Senate Democrats defending their seats with control of the chamber hanging in the balance. By the time Rosen was named the winner, the GOP had long since won control of the Senate and she will return to Washington as a member of the minority party.",
      "The AP declares a winner only when it can determine that a trailing candidate can\u2019t close the gap and overtake the vote leader.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how the AP called this race:",
      "CANDIDATES: Rosen (D) vs. Brown (R) and two others plus \u201cNone of these candidates.\u201d",
      "POLL CLOSING TIME: 10 p.m. ET",
      "ABOUT THE RACE: Rosen was one of five vulnerable Senate Democrats running for reelection in a cycle when a loss by any one of them could have cost their party control of the chamber, given the Republican pick-up of the retiring Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s seat in West Virginia earlier on election night.",
      "Rosen was first elected in 2018, when she defeated Republican incumbent Dean Heller by 5 percentage points. Brown ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination for the state\u2019s other U.S. Senate seat in 2022, placing a distant second in a crowded field behind Adam Laxalt. He is a retired Army captain who was nearly killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Rosen more than doubled Brown\u2019s spending and fundraising haul for the cycle, but both entered the final two-and-a-half week stretch of the campaign about evenly matched in terms of available cash in the bank.",
      "In statewide elections, Democrats tend to carry only two of Nevada\u2019s 17 counties: Clark (home to Las Vegas) and Washoe (home to Reno). Whether they win depends on how big their margins are in those two counties. Clark County has by far the largest population in the state. A large vote margin there is vital to Democratic electoral success. It comprised 69% of the total statewide vote in 2020. Washoe is more competitive.",
      "WHY AP CALLED THE RACE: In vote results reported after Election Day, Rosen has consistently won every update released by election officials in Clark and Washoe counties. There\u2019s no precedent in recent Nevada elections for ballots counted late in the process in those counties to back a Republican, and at the time of AP\u2019s race call, there were not enough ballots left in the state\u2019s rural counties to make up for her edge in Clark and Washoe.",

      "SEATTLE -- A 37-year-old man who police say stabbed five people in Seattle in broad daylight Friday and possibly four others the day before made his first court appearance Saturday where a judge ordered him held on $2 million bail.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in and travel to the Chinatown-International District deserve to feel safe and be safe,\u201d said King County Prosecuting Attorney Leesa Manion after the judge found probable cause to hold him on five counts of first-degree assault.",
      "In setting the high bail amount, the judge noted that the man had a warrant out for his arrest. He also has nine felony convictions in Washington state that include four car thefts, possession of stolen property, robbery and attempted burglary, according to the probable cause report.",
      "The case is still under investigation and has not been referred to the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for a charging decision, spokesperson Casey McNerthney said Saturday. They expect to receive the case by Thursday, he said.",
      "Messages sent to the King County Department of Public Defense seeking comment were not immediately returned Saturday afternoon.",
      "Four of the five victims were taken to Harborview Medical Center on Friday. One man who was in critical condition was upgraded to serious, while two others remain in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit, Susan Gregg, spokesperson for the hospital, said Saturday. Another male patient was in satisfactory condition, she said.",
      "Police said they recovered two knives soiled with what appeared to be blood in the parking lot where the man was arrested. A third knife was lodged in a victim's back when he was taken to the hospital, court records said.",
      "Seattle police said they believe the man was also involved in at least four other stabbings in the same area on Thursday. He fit the descriptions of the suspect and the attacks were also random, like Friday's assaults. Police continue to investigate the case and more charges may be added, they said.",
      "The Thursday stabbings in Chinatown started when a 52-year-old woman was found with multiple stab wounds, police said. On Thursday afternoon, a 32-year-old man was found after being stabbed multiple times and at about 8 p.m., a 37-year-old man was stabbed multiple times in the back, police said.",
      "On Friday at about 2 p.m., police received 911 reports that four people had been stabbed in Chinatown. Another victim was found about a block away, the probable cause statement said.",
      "One witness told police that he saw the suspect walk up behind a man and stab him in the back. That man was hospitalized with four stab wounds. The witness said he followed the suspect as he calmly walked up the street and then stabbed three people as they stood on a corner.",
      "Video evidence showed that the suspect also stabbed another man before striking the group of three, police said. The video shows the suspect walking behind a person and stabbing him in the back. He fell to the ground with the knife still lodged in his back, police said.",
      "Police arrived and used witness descriptions to take the man into custody. He was wearing a black sweatshirt with writing across the chest that read \u201cFear of God State,\u201d police said. He had what appeared to be blood on his hands and shoes, police said.",
      "\u201cThis incident was apparently one individual over a 38-hour period of time committing random assaults,\u201d Deputy Chief Eric Barden said at the scene Friday."

      "Works from the Boy Scouts of America's art collection, including some paintings by Norman Rockwell, will go up for auction to help compensate tens of thousands of people, mainly men, who were sexually abused while in scouting",
      "DALLAS -- In one Norman Rockwell painting, a family proudly welcomes a beaming Boy Scout home from camp, his duffel bag in hand. In another of Rockwell\u2019s achingly idyllic works, a Cub Scout stands on a chair to measure the chest of his older brother, a Boy Scout who has taped his fitness record to his bedroom wall.",
      "Many of the works from the Boy Scouts of America\u2019s collection are as interwoven into American life as the organization itself, having been featured on magazine covers, calendars and even used to sell war bonds. Next week, the works will begin to be auctioned off to help pay the compensation owed to tens of thousands of people \u2014 mainly men \u2014 who were sexually abused while in scouting.",
      "The collection of over 300 works, including dozens by Rockwell, is estimated to be worth nearly $60 million \u2014 a tiny amount in relation to the organization\u2019s multibillion dollar bankruptcy plan. Campgrounds and other Boy Scouts\u2019 properties have also been sold to help pay the survivors.",
      "\u201cThe idea that an iconic art collection that the Boy Scouts have assembled over many years is being liquidated in order to pay survivors recoveries and to bring them some measure of justice I think is very significant,\u201d said Barbara Houser, a retired bankruptcy judge who is overseeing the survivors\u2019 settlement trust.",
      "This year, the 114-year-old organization based in suburban Dallas announced it is rebranding to Scouting America, a change intended to signal the organization\u2019s commitment to inclusivity. The group now welcomes girls, as well as gay youth and leaders.",
      "Hoping to survive a barrage of sexual abuse claims, the Boy Scouts filed for bankruptcy in 2020. The $2.4 billion bankruptcy plan, among the nation\u2019s biggest and most complex, allowed the organization to continue operating while it compensated survivors. It went into effect last year.",
      "Houser said over 82,000 people filed claims during the bankruptcy case, and of those, over 64,000 have filled out a detailed questionnaire to assert their claims. Survivors will be paid according to the severity of the abuse they suffered.",
      "\u201cMany of these survivors have been waiting decades, literally, for there to be some recognition of what happened to them,\u201d Houser said.",
      "There could be multiple distributions of funds to survivors as money becomes available and further litigation plays out, and how much each survivor gets will depend on how much money the trust collects, Houser said.",
      "So far, nearly 6,000 survivors have elected to receive one-time payments of $3,500, and different settlements are being determined for other survivors, with some payments beginning for them.",
      "In addition to the art sale, those contributing to the trust include insurers and local Boy Scout councils. As of last month, over 30 council properties have been sold, Scouting America said.",
      "Tom Krumins had only just started having conversations with family and friends about being abused as a middle-schooler at a camp in South Carolina when the bankruptcy was filed, and it took him months to decide whether to join the settlement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the type of bravery and courage that an Eagle Scout should show but at the same time it does feel like you\u2019re ripping away a part of yourself or losing yourself along the way,\u201d Krumins said.",
      "He said his focus has been the Boy Scouts\u2019 commitments to youth protections, which survivors insisted be strengthened before they would vote in favor of the bankruptcy plan. The money will be helpful but what is most important is \u201cmaking sure this never happens again,\u201d he said.",
      "Doug Kennedy, a survivor and co-chair of a committee representing victims in the bankruptcy case, said that more than three-fourths of claimants approved the plan, but that watching the process play out through the courts has been \u201cagonizing\u201d for survivors.",
      "\u201cThe reality is for most survivors, all this resolves is the bankruptcy, it doesn\u2019t resolve their pain and it doesn\u2019t resolve what was taken away from them,\u201d he said.",
      "The collection will be sold by Heritage Auctions in Dallas in the coming years, including over two dozen works that are going on the block Friday.",
      "The collection includes nearly 60 works by Rockwell, who worked for the organization\u2019s magazine, Boys\u2019 Life, at the beginning of his career, and maintained a relationship with scouting \u2014 including creating images for their calendars \u2014 for more than half a century.",
      "A work by J.C. Leyendecker depicting a Scout signaling with flags was painted in 1911, a year after the organization was founded. It appeared on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post and was reproduced many times on scouting materials. His 1918 painting of a Boy Scout clutching a sword in front of a flag-draped, shield-wielding depiction of Lady Liberty was adapted as a poster to sell World War I bonds.",
      "\u201cMany artists were really involved in sort of cementing the culture and the vision of the Boy Scouts,\u201d said Aviva Lehmann, Heritage\u2019s senior vice president of American art.",
      "For the last four years, the works have been on display at the Medici Museum in Ohio. Before that, some had been on display at the National Scouting Museum."

      "At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris, 52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win about seven out of every ten votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were counted.",

      "POLL CLOSING TIME: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET.",
      "ABOUT THE RACE: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state, where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election Day.",
      "Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border.",
      "Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by Republicans then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate contests and the governorship since 2018.",
      "Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years.",

Trump carried the county by 3 points in 2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%.",
      "WHY AP CALLED THE RACE:",
      "In statewide elections going back a dozen years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz.",

      "Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on election night, Trump has consistently led since then.",
      "The AP\u2019s analysis of Arizona's voting history and political demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris' favor, they would not be enough to give her the lead.",

      "AUGUSTA, Maine -- A ranked-choice voting tabulation aimed at determining the winner of a key congressional race in Maine will start on Tuesday with scanning of ballots into a computer at a centralized location, with a goal of having results by week's end, the state's top election official said Saturday.",
      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden already said he won the election in Maine's 2nd Congressional District but the secretary of state said neither Golden nor Republican Austin Theriault surpassed 50% of first-place votes on Election Day, necessitating the shipment of ballots to the state capital for an additional voting round.",
      "Under Maine's ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates in order of preference on ballots. If no candidate wins a majority of first-place votes, then the lesser choices of the last-place finisher\u2019s supporters are reallocated to establish a majority winner.",
      "Election officials intend to begin scanning ballots into a computer Tuesday afternoon with a goal of running the tabulation by week's end, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Saturday. After ranked voting is concluded, state election officials will begin a formal recount requested by Theriault based on the razor-thin margin.",
      "As it stands, both candidates were just below 49%, with Golden holding a slight edge of about 2,000 votes, according to figures released by the secretary of state.",
      "Golden and Theriault were the only candidates on the ballot, but Diana Merenda of Surry, who ran an organized write-in candidacy, received several hundred votes. The second choices of any voters who left their first choice blank also will be counted. Other write-in candidates will be treated as blanks.",
      "The race is among a handful of pivotal races without a declared winner, with control of the U.S. House at stake. The thin margin came in an election in which Republican Donald Trump won the 2nd District, allowing him to collect one of Maine\u2019s four electoral votes.

      "The Los Angeles Times reported Friday that the Democratic governor agreed to pay $13,000 in a settlement with the Fair Political Practices Commission.",
      "State law requires elected officials to report donations made on their behalf within 30 days. Elected officials often ask companies to make these charitable donations, and the payments aren't subject to campaign contribution limits but are required to be reported out.",
      "The Commission said Newsom and his 2018 campaign committee didn\u2019t make donation reports on time on 18 occasions, sometimes filing them months late. Among them was one payment of more than $12 million from T-Mobile, the Times reported.",
      "Newsom\u2019s campaign said some filings were late because it had to depend on third parties to track filing information. Nathan Click, a spokesperson for the governor, said Newsom has filed a thousand other such reports on time."

      "The Associated Press left phone and emailed messages seeking comment Friday from Brown's campaign. In a Saturday morning post on X, Brown thanked Nevada.",
      "\"Serving as your nominee has been the honor of a lifetime, and though the outcome is not what we hoped, I am deeply moved by the trust, dedication, and hope you\u2019ve shown throughout this journey,\" Brown said.",
      "Brown had Trump\u2019s support in the Republican primary and won easily, but he was significantly outspent during the campaign, leaving Rosen to dominate the airwaves for months.",
      "Rosen, a former Las Vegas-area synagogue president and computer programmer, ran ads touting herself as an independent who doesn\u2019t listen to \u201cparty leaders.\u201d",

      "Rosen also spotlighted her work on expanding broadband internet access and helping to connect Las Vegas with Southern California via light rail.",
      "And she hammered Brown for his opposition to abortion rights, saying he would support a national abortion ban despite Brown\u2019s statements that he respects Nevada voters' choice decades ago to legalize abortions.",
      "A ballot measure this year that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution passed. Voters must again approve it in 2026 in order to amend the constitution.",
      "The Senate contest drew relatively little national interest for most of the campaign, a striking contrast with the presidential race as both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris targeted the state and its six electoral votes.

      "Two years ago, Gluesenkamp Perez, who owns an auto-repair shop with her husband, came out of nowhere to win the seat, which hadn\u2019t been in Democratic hands for over a decade. She beat the Trump-endorsed Kent by fewer than 3,000 votes out of nearly 320,000 cast, making it one of the closest races in the country and setting the stage for a tough election fight this year.",
      "Her predecessor, Republican Jaime Herrera Beutler, held office for six terms but failed to survive the 2022 primary after voting to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6 insurrection. The district narrowly went for Trump in 2020, making it a crucial target for both parties this year.",
      "The race gained additional attention last week when an arson attack struck a ballot box in Vancouver \u2014 the district\u2019s biggest city \u2014 scorching hundreds of ballots. People who cast their votes in that box were urged to contact the county auditor\u2019s office to receive replacement ballots.",
      "Gluesenkamp Perez has balanced progressive policies with some measures popular with Republicans during her tenure, including securing the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 something she criticizes Biden for failing to do \u2014 and introducing a constitutional amendment to force presidents to balance the budget.",
      "She supports abortion access and has hammered Kent, who previously has said he supported a national abortion ban, for changing his position after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Kent now says abortion laws should be left up to the states.",
      "Gluesenkamp Perez supports policies to counter climate change, but also speaks openly about being a gun owner. A top priority is pushing a \u201cright to repair\u201d bill that would help people get equipment fixed without having to pay exorbitant prices to the original manufacturer.",
      "Kent, a former Green Beret who has called for the impeachment of President Joe Biden, cited inflation and illegal immigration as top concerns.",
      "The two disagreed on a major local issue: the replacement of a major bridge across the Columbia River between Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington. Gluesenkamp Perez supports plans to replace the existing bridge; Kent argued that a separate new bridge should be built while the old one is maintained."

      "Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including Darfur. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured, and recently warned that the country has been pushed to the brink of famine.",

Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. That legacy appears to have returned, with the International Criminal Court\u2019s prosecutor, Karim Khan, saying in January there were grounds to believe both sides may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide in Darfur. The RSF was born out of the Janjaweed.",

      "Influencers excitedly wonder what eyeliner, serum or hand cream will be behind door one, and gush over the beautiful box it has come in.",
      "But are these products, which can cost hundreds of pounds, actually worth the money?",
      "Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester.",
      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",
      "The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together.",
      "\"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December.",
      "The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\".",
      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable spending that amount of money, mainly because I wouldn\u2019t have that amount of spare cash,\" says Emma.",
      "\"They can be very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m not the type that would pay full price,\" Nihal says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re going to use every single product then maybe yes. But sometimes in these prepacked stuff, you\u2019ll probably only use two or three of these products.\"",
      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",
      "But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one.",
      "\"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson.",
      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",
      "Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount.",
      "Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year.",
      "Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there.",
      "\"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\"",
      "With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar.",
      "But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case.",
      "\"They always sell out every year, so I feel like there\u2019s room for more.\""

      "\"I was definitely pleased to get it back at least,\" he said.",
      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",
      "The main reason, behind \u00a3146m of the total, is that repayments were taken from people despite them not earning above the annual threshold at which point repayments automatically kick in.",
      "This can happen when someone earns above the monthly threshold which triggers the beginning of loan repayments, due to things like to taking extra shifts, getting a new job or receiving a bonus, but their annual earnings might still fall below the yearly threshold.",
      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",
      "However, as Mr Allingham said, many university graduates may need the cash for their day-to-day expenses.",
      "\"It is definitely worth doing, particularly even with the cost of living crisis still lingering on a little bit, having that extra boost of cash right now could make a world of difference,\" Mr Allingham said.",

    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "What are interest rates and why do they change?",
      "An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it.",
      "The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money.",
      "This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts.",
      "The Bank of England moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is the increase in the price of something over time.",
      "When inflation is high, the Bank may decide to raise rates to keep it at or near the 2% target.",
      "The idea is to encourage people to spend less, to help bring inflation down by reducing demand.",
      "Once this starts to happen, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them.",

      "The current Bank rate is 4.75%, after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years.",

      "The main inflation measure, CPI, rose by 1.7% in the 12 months to September 2024 which was down from 2.2% in August. This means prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers.",
      "It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards.",
      "How much could interest rates fall?",
      "It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as this depends whether inflation remains consistently below the Bank's target.",
      "The picture has altered following October's Budget by Chancellor Rachel Reeves. It included plans to borrow and spend billions of pounds, so financial markets and the Bank expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated.",

      "Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.42%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts. A five-year deal is 5.13%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of households in England and Wales will struggle to pay their water bills when they go up, a consumer watchdog has warned.",
      "The water regulator, Ofwat, has provisionally said bills would rise by an average of \u00a319 a year between 2025 and 2030 - a 21% increase over that period.",
      "But in a survey of 9,500 households carried out by the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), some 18% said they were already struggling with bills and 40% said they would struggle to afford these rises.",
      "Water companies said they were proposing an increase in support to struggling households to protect vulnerable customers.",
      "Ofwat and water firms have been locked in tense negotiations over how much they will be able to charge for the five years from April next year.",
      "In this major survey from the Consumer Council for Water (CCW), customers across 19 water company areas were presented with the proposed bill rises that were adjusted for inflation.",
      "Some 40% of the 9,500 people asked said they would find bill rises difficult to afford. Of those:",
      "54% said they would have to cut back on non-essentials to pay for it43% said they would use less water38% said they would cut back on food shopping and other essentials",
      "54% said they would have to cut back on non-essentials to pay for it",
      "43% said they would use less water",
      "38% said they would cut back on food shopping and other essentials",
      "While 75% of households surveyed supported their water companies' plans for investment, that fell to 58% when they were reminded of the associated bill rises.",
      "Mike Keil, chief executive of the CCW, said the bill increases would put an \"intolerable strain\" on the finances of millions of households.",
      "\"It\u2019s quite frightening the extent to which water affordability is going to affect people in the future.\"",
      "He said a third of households under strain will cut back on essentials \"like food shopping\" in order to pay their water bill.",
      "\"That's a situation we just can't let happen,\" he added.",
      "Every water company has a scheme which can help reduce your bills if you are on a low income, but eligibility and support varies by company.",
      "The CCW is calling for a single social tariff across England and Wales to end what it calls a \"postcode lottery of assistance\".",
      "Mr Keil said current support on offer for customers in the form of social tariffs was \"completely inconsistent\".",
      "\"We are calling for the current system to be revamped and replaced with a much more fair system of social tariffs so it is consistent across England and Wales, which means that everyone who is struggling can be assured that that safety net is in place and support is there if they need it,\" he said.",
      "He says a single social tariff would be funded  centrally and distributed where the need is greatest.",
      "\"Water companies committed back in 2019, as part of a public interest commitment, to end water poverty by 2030, and this single social tariff is the best way to do that,\" he said.",
      "Ofwat and the Environment Agency are still continuing with investigations into all water companies in England and Wales after sewage spills into England's lakes, rivers and seas more than doubled in 2023.",
      "Mr Keil said customers wanted to see investment but also \"need to see evidence their money is being well spent\" to repair trust in water firms.",
      "'A bit bleak'",
      "Jonathan Sawers, 48, in Southampton pays Southern Water \u00a3600 a year.",
      "The firm landed a \u00a390m fine for dumping raw sewage in the sea, which its chief executive said came about because the company had not invested enough.",
      "Ofwat has forecast Southern Water will put bills up by 44% and Mr Sawers told the BBC the extra \u201c\u00a3200-\u00a3300 a year won\u2019t just appear from nowhere\u201d.",
      "He said paying the water bill after constant increases has \u201cbeen tough at times\u201d that has put stress on his wife and children. He has just come out of arrears from previous bill rises, he added.",
      "\u201cNow with the possibility of a 44% increase to our bill so that Southern Water can pay the fine imposed by Ofwat, our bill could potentially be \u00a3900,\" he said.",
      "\u201cConsidering my latest pay offer is 1% per year over three years and along with the gas and electric hikes of the past couple of years it\u2019s all looking a bit bleak\u201d, he said.",
      "In July, Ofwat provisionally said bills would rise by an average of \u00a319 per year between 2025 and 2030 - totalling a \u00a394 increase, or a 21% rise, over that five year period. That increase does not include inflation.",
      "The bill hike varies by region with the regulator agreeing to a rise of 44% for Southern Water, and 11% for Northumbrian Water.",
      "Since July, some companies have asked for further increases. For example, Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, was given the go-ahead to lift bills by 23%. It has since said it needs to raise bills by 59%, in order to keep operating as normal.",
      "The BBC understands Ofwat is considering permitting bigger bill increases for some companies when it makes a final decision in December, to reflect higher financing costs.",
      "Responding to the CCW survey, Water UK, which represents the sector, said companies wanted to provide more help to customers struggling with bill rises.",
      "\u201cWe urgently need investment in our water and sewage infrastructure,\" a spokesman said.",
      "He added the survey showed there was widespread public support for investment to secure water supplies and stop sewage spills.",
      "\"However, we understand increasing bills is never welcome,\" he said.",
      "Ofwat said it would \"fully consider\" the findings from the CCW research.",
      "\"It is also clear the majority of customers accepted the investment being proposed and the increase in bills needed to fund it, but it is crucial companies deliver the meaningful improvements this investment is designed to bring\", a spokesperson said.",
      "\"Performance in the past has not been good enough. This is the challenge the companies will need to meet in the years ahead \u2013 and we will be closely monitoring progress as they do.\"",

    "summary": "Its chair says officials have questions to answer as to why details of an overspend were not shared.",
    "story": [
      "The Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend in the public finances in the run-up to the previous government's Spring Budget \"under the law\", the UK's budget watchdog has said.",
      "Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), told a committee of MPs on Tuesday the Treasury should explain why information was \"not provided to us\".",
      "His comments prompted the committee's chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier to suggest the Treasury \"may have broken the law\".",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC it had acted \"within the law\" but said it had made changes to make sure the \"unidentified pressures... never happen again\".",
      "The Conservative party has been contacted for comment.",
      "Last week, the OBR said the previous government \"did not provide\" them with all available information at former chancellor Jeremy Hunt's last Budget in March.",
      "The \u00a39.5bn overspend forms the basis of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 claim that the Conservatives left Labour with a significant \"hole\" in the public finances.",
      "Asked by the committee on Tuesday how the shortfall could have happened, the OBR's Mr Hughes said \"the system very clearly broke down\", but insisted \"that kind of failure will not happen again\" because of processes put in place since.",
      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound.",
      "Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\".",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",
      "He said it \"was a question for the Treasury to ask: why was information available within the Treasury and not provided to us?\"",
      "In summarising Mr Hughes' comments, Hillier said: \"The Treasury may have even broken the law in the run-up to the Spring Budget in not disclosing all the spending information.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Hunt has previously accused the OBR of failing to act in a \"politically impartial manner\" by releasing its findings about the overspend on the day of the Budget last week, arguing it would help make the case for Labour's big tax rises.",
      "Hunt said it was \"impossible to know\" how much of the \u00a39.5bn would have been compensated for by savings elsewhere.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cAt the time of the Spring Budget, we communicated to the OBR the decision that ministers would manage spending pressures by making offsetting savings. This was within the law.",
      "\"We have accepted all the recommendations put forward by the OBR in its review of the March 2024 forecast.",
      "\"This is enshrined in the new Charter for Budget Responsibility to ensure that the unfunded pressures identified at the Public Spending Audit never happen again.\"",

      "Separately, the OBR told the committee workers will take most of the hit from the upcoming increase to employers' National Insurance (NI) contributions.",
      "At the Budget, Reeves said employers will pay NI at a rate of 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000 from April, up from 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100.",
      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",
      "He said part of the reason for this was the reduction of the threshold for employers paying the tax.",
      "However, he suggested that the personal impact for workers might see \"a bit of an offset\" with the increase to minimum wages announced in the Budget.",

      "At the committee, lawyers were asked about their experience of the Horizon Shortfall compensation scheme, which is overseen by the Post Office.",
      "This compensation scheme is for sub-postmasters who were not convicted, or part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) court action, but who believe they experienced shortfalls because of Horizon.",
      "David Enright, whose law firm represents hundreds of Post Office victims, said there is no funding for legal advice at the start, with claimants presented with a \"DIY questionnaire\".",

      "\"To date, both parties are demonstrating that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and users which paves the way for a far stronger three-player market than the current imbalance,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",

      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",

      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",

      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",

      "But along with an outpouring of praise for Jiang and her teacher, the student\u2019s story also sparked a discussion about whether China\u2019s education system did enough to support gifted students in less academic pathways - especially those who may not have received similar recognition by their teachers.",
      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",

      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",

      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",

    "story": [
      "The much-anticipated new Paddington in Peru film has had mixed reviews over its opening weekend, with critics calling it \"charming-enough\", but some agreeing the film struggles to reach the heights of its predecessors.",
      "The third instalment in the Paddington live action adventure franchise sees the marmalade sandwich munching bear return to Peru to visit his aunt Lucy.",
      "The film, that includes a return of much loved cast members including Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Hugh Bonneville, opened in UK cinemas on Friday 8 November.",
      "Since the beginning of the film series in 2014, Paddington Bear has grown to become a national treasure with fans of all ages through its heart-warming appeal.",
      "Of the latest film, Peter Bradshaw wrote in the Guardian that the experience was \"just as jolly as the previous two films, but not really as funny\" and likened it to a \"special episode of a TV sitcom that takes the cast to the Costa del Sol\".",
      "In the Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin wrote that while the film \"lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edge that elevated the first two Paddington movies\", it was \"serviceable enough given its limitations\".",
      "Nick Curtis was more cutting with his two star review in the Standard, saying Paddington in Peru \"misses the easy charm, the fluency and the icy sliver of jeopardy\" from the first two movies \"which had genuine cross-generational appeal\".",
      "He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant.",
      "Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears.",
      "\"Whether riffing on The Sound Of Music, strumming irritatingly on a guitar, or struggling to keep a phony smile plastered across her face, Colman is great fun, though a little underused. Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\"",
      "Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love.",
      "\"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"",
      "The director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\".",
      "Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\".",
      "She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\"",
      "Away from the big screen, a new Paddington musical is being developed for the stage, with McFly's Tom Fletcher set to write the music and lyrics.",
      "On November 7 the cast of the upcoming film unveiled special livery on a Great Western Railway (GWR) train that will travel through Devon and Cornwall.",

    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",
      "The case raises a perplexing question: is a notification valid if no copy of it can be found?",
      "The simple answer is, we don't know yet.",
      "The court has not clarified if the book could be accessed in India but advised Mr Khan to pursue any legal options to obtain it.",
      "Uddyam Mukherjee, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer, told the BBC that federal departments couldn\u2019t provide a clear answer either, when asked by the court.",
      "\u201cI have never come across a situation like this,\u201d said Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court.",
      "If the notification is not found then \u201ctechnically no ban exists\u201d and the book can be imported.",
      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",
      "However, some legal experts disagree.",
      "Raju Ramachandran, a senior lawyer, said he found the suggestion a \u201clittle extreme\u201d.",
      "\u201cAll that the high court says is that this particular petition has become infructuous [invalid] since the notification could not be found,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has not given the right to the petitioner to import the book.\u201d",
      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",
      "In 2012, the government of Rajasthan state sought the arrest of four Indian authors - Hari Kunzru, Ruchir Joshi, Amitava Kumar and Jeet Thayil - after they downloaded a few passages from the Satanic Verses and read them out at a literary festival in the city.",
      "At the time, many legal experts were of the opinion that downloading a book whose import had been banned could not be considered a crime. But online copies of the book have been hard to find in India.",
      "Rushdie, 76, continues to face threats over his outspoken views on Islam.",
      "In 2022, he lost an eye and spent six weeks in hospital after being stabbed up to 10 times on stage at an event in New York state. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder.",
      "In his recent memoir, the writer has criticised the response to his book, noting that \"no properly authorised body [in India] had reviewed the book, nor was there any semblance of a judicial process\"."

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",
      "\u201cIt's hard not to go overboard with admiration for a nonagenarian who remains so unaffected by her fame on the one hand,\u201d wrote one, \u201cand some of the awful things life has thrown at her on the other.\u201d",
      "She held a special place in the nation\u2019s heart as queen of its longest-running radio drama, and was thought of with enormous affection by her fellow cast members.",
      "June \u201cshone through sadness without a word of complaint,\" recalled Charles Collingwood - who plays Brian Aldridge, her fictional son-in-law, \u201cand always remained immense fun\"."

      "Then aged 41, Jones had already made an indelible mark on American music as a performer, arranger, songwriter, producer, soundtrack composer and record executive.",
      "He started out in the jumping jazz clubs of the 1950s; mastered soul, swing and pop on recordings by Dinah Washington, Frank Sinatra and Lesley Gore; and reached the top 10 in his own right.",
      "Some of the biggest entertainers in America agreed to perform at his memorial.",

      "Even more exciting things were yet to come.",
      "Jones went on to forge an era-defining partnership with Michael Jackson; oversee 1985's We Are the World, one of the biggest-selling songs of all time; craft hits for acts like Chaka Khan and Donna Summer; and work with the biggest names in hip-hop.",
      "Few branches of American popular music were immune to his influence.",
      "Jones had always been a survivor.",
      "He grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression in the 1930s on the South Side of Chicago. His mother was taken to a psychiatric institution when he was seven and his father worked as a carpenter for notorious gangsters the Jones Boys.",
      "Young Quincy wanted to be a gangster too. \"You want to be what you see, and that's all we ever saw,\" he said.",
      "He and his brother were \"street rats\" and, when he strayed into the wrong neighbourhood at the age of seven, a rival gang member \"nailed my hand to a fence\". Another injury came from an ice pick to the face.",
      "His father took the family to Washington state, where one night Quincy and some friends broke into a community centre, looking for food. Inside, there was a piano.",
      "\"I touched it and every cell in my body said, this is what you'll do [for] the rest of your life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2016.",
      "The encounter \"changed my life\", he said in conversation with rapper Kendrick Lamar for a 2018 Netflix documentary, adding that, \"I would have been dead or in prison a long time ago\" if he hadn't discovered music.",
      "Quincy immediately began experimenting with instruments at school, settling on the trumpet, and began playing in nightclubs.",
      "At the age of 14, he made friends with another then-unknown musician called Ray Charles, who became a lifelong collaborator.",
      "He also played with Billie Holiday at 14, and got taken under the wings of bandleader Count Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry. He went on to accompany Dizzy Gillespie and appeared in the band during Elvis Presley's first TV appearance.",
      "After showing a talent for arranging songs while touring the world with Lionel Hampton's big band, he was soon in demand in that capacity, too.",
      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sinatra had been impressed with Jones's work and called on him to arrange and conduct two of his albums in the 1960s. The pair formed a fertile partnership, with Sinatra calling him \"a giant\" and \"one of the finest musicians I've ever known\".",
      "The pair became firm friends outside the studio, too. \"Seven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying,\" Jones recalled.",

      "In Cold Blood's author Truman Capote reportedly tried to have Jones removed from the film because he was black. But he remained, and the score earned Jones the first of seven Oscar nominations.",
      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",
      "In 2015, he went into a diabetic coma for four days, and the following year went to hospital with a blood clot.",
      "His death on Sunday at the age of 91 has left the music world in mourning.",
      "If there's to be a second Quincy Jones memorial concert, stars will be queuing up to celebrate the full achievements of a singular talent."

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:20:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician, who has died aged 91, was one of the most consequential producers in jazz and pop.",
    "story": [
      "\"Music is sacred to me,\" Quincy Jones once said. \"Melody is God's voice.\"",
      "He certainly had the divine touch.",
      "Jones, who has died at the age of 91, was the right-hand man to both Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson, and helped to shape the sound of jazz and pop over more than 60 years.",
      "His recordings revolutionised music by crossing genres, promoting unlikely collaborations and shaping modern production techniques.",
      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "Listen to Billie Jean",
      "2) Frank Sinatra - Come Fly With Me (Live at The Sands)",
      "\"The friendship was so strong. You can't describe it,\" said Jones of his partnership with Frank Sinatra - which extended far beyond the recording studio.",
      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fitted the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died of lung cancer in 1990. In 2019, on what would have been her 95th birthday, Jones posted a tribute to the singer, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote on Facebook..",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",

      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",

      "Officers can currently use cells as a \"place of safety\" for up to 24 hours to allow those needing immediate care to be assessed by a doctor.",
      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",

      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",

      "The NHS will review whether to change its advice on testing for prostate cancer in light of Sir Chris Hoy's \"powerful\" call for more younger men to be checked, the health secretary has said.",
      "Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris, 48, has advanced cancer that has spread to his bones and is terminal.",
      "In his first TV interview since announcing his condition, Sir Chris told BBC Breakfast how people with a strong family history should consider seeing their GP for PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test to help spot the disease.",
      "PSA tests are not routinely offered to men under 50 without symptoms but who may be at risk. Doctors are instead told to use their judgement.",
      "Sir Chris told BBC Breakfast: \"To me it seems a no-brainer. Why would they not reduce the age? Bring the age down and allow more men to go in and get a blood test.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that Sir Chris makes a powerful argument. \"That's why I've asked the NHS to look at the case for lowering the age.\"",
      "\"It's obviously got to be evidence-led, clinically-led decisions,\" he said.",
      "I'm more grateful for each day, Sir Chris Hoy tells BBC",
      "I'm more grateful for each day, Sir Chris Hoy tells BBC",
      "NHS guidelines for England say anyone can request a PSA test if they are over the age of 50.",
      "And men of any age who have symptoms can also ask for one.",
      "Routine PSA testing or screening is not offered on the NHS, because experts say the test is not accurate enough on its own to rule in or out cancer reliably. Doctors are looking at whether adding in MRI scans to PSA tests might improve the situation.",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",
      "The charity Prostate Cancer UK backs the call, saying doing more checks could potentially save thousands of lives each year.",
      "Spokeswoman Chiara De Biase said: \"One in eight men will get prostate cancer, but there's currently no screening programme for the disease.",
      "\"If your dad or brother has had prostate cancer, or you're black, you have the highest risk of getting the disease, and we strongly recommend you talk to your GP about testing from 45.",
      "\"Right now, you need to be aware of this and bring it up with a GP yourself. As prostate cancer often has no symptoms in its earlier stages this is leading to too many men getting a late, incurable diagnosis - like Sir Chris.\"",
      "Sir Chris spoke of the \"absolute shock and horror\" he felt at his initial diagnosis.",
      "The news that he had a terminal illness, in September 2023, came \"completely out the blue\".",
      "\"No symptoms, no warnings, nothing. All I had was a pain in my shoulder and a little bit of pain in my ribs.\"",
      "And he spoke of the \"nightmare\" of learning wife Sarra had multiple sclerosis, and having to break the news to their two young children.",
      "\"We just tried to be positive and tried to say 'Do you know what? This is what we're doing and you can help because when I'm not feeling well, you can come and give me cuddles, you can be supportive, you can be happy, you can be kind to each other'.\"",
      "He said he was grateful for the outpouring of support they had received and that he was focusing on the positives and the good he hopes can come from it.",
      "'It's been the toughest year'",
      "His news prompted a near eight-fold increase in NHS searches for prostate cancer symptoms over the following days.",
      "\"It's been the toughest year of our lives so far by some stretch,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Maybe people seeing this or hearing about my story - just by them asking their GP - will create enough of a surge of interest that people that make the decisions will go 'you know what, we need to address this'. And in the long term this will save potentially millions of lives.\"",
      "He added: \"I know what the end result will be. Nobody lives forever. Our time on this planet is finite. Don't waste your time worrying about stuff that isn't that important. Focus on the things that are.",
      "\"My perspective on life has changed massively. I am more thankful, I'm more grateful for each day. It's been a tough year and it's going to be tough ahead in the future too but for now, right here right now, we're doing pretty well.\"",
      "The NHS advises men to speak to a doctor if they think they are higher risk of prostate cancer. A man's risk of this cancer increases with age.",
      "Cancer Research UK says the evidence so far suggests that routinely screening people using PSA would not greatly help prevent deaths and might instead lead to men having unnecessary treatment that could cause undue stress and potential side effects.",
      "PSA is not diagnostic. A raised PSA level does not necessarily mean there is cancer. It can be elevated with other conditions too, such as inflammation.",
      "If you ask for a PSA test, your doctor may advise you to think carefully about the benefits and disadvantages.",
      "The full interview - Sir Chris Hoy: Finding Hope - will be shown on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday, 5 November and will then be available to watch on BBC iPlayer. You can also listen in full on BBC Sounds.",

    "summary": "David Lammy is on his first visit to the continent since he became foreign secretary.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",

      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",
      "During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was \"solving the climate crisis\" and \"transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner\".",
      "Anyone, he said, including oil and gas companies, \"could come with solutions\" because Azerbaijan\u2019s \"doors are open\".",

      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

    "summary": "It is also set to be the world's first breach of 1.5C of warming across an entire calendar year.",
    "story": [
      "It is now \"virtually certain\" that 2024 - a year punctuated by intense heatwaves and deadly storms - will be the world's warmest on record, according to projections by the European climate service.",
      "Global average temperatures across the year are on track to end up more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which would make 2024 the first calendar year to breach this symbolic mark.",
      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",
      "While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck,\" said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute.",
      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

      "As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China.",

      "There was a big drop in the share price of turbine manufacturers on Wednesday, as fears grew that US offshore wind farms would be cancelled by a Trump presidency.",

      "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.",

      "With energy watchdog the International Energy Agency reporting that global investment in clean technology is running at double the size of coal, oil and gas in 2024, the new US administration might not want to drive this type of green investment into other, more eager countries.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 14:21:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers are looking forward to the next meteor shower, the Northern Taurids, which are set to peak on 11-12 November.",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon, and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, traversing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October 13 to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour, but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year periodicity with these fireballs. There were lots of fireball sightings in 2022. The next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view the Taurid meteor shower is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Anticyclonic gloom has settled on the UK recently bringing extensive cloud.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "Plus, as we have seen recently, it is hard to see anything in the sky if there is a blanket of low cloud. However, there could be some timely changes in cloud amounts at the time of peak viewing.",
      "A weather front crossing the UK on Sunday will bring a change in air mass. Even though an area of high pressure will build again, it may not contain as much cloud.",
      "It is possible that the clouds will part on Monday night and give us a better chance of seeing some spectacular meteor displays.",

      "The free online gaming platform, which has around 70 million daily users worldwide, allows players to create their own games and play those made by others.",
      "It is particularly popular with children - but some have complained they have been exposed to upsetting and harmful content on the site.",
      "Starting 3 December, game creators will be asked to say whether their games are suitable for under-13s - with any that fail to do so being blocked for players 12 and younger.",
      "And from 18 November, under-13s will also be barred from accessing \"social hangouts\", which are online spaces where players can talk to each other by text and voice.",
      "It specifies hangout experiences as games where \"the primary theme or purpose\" is to allow people to communicate with each other as themselves, rather than role-playing as a character.",
      "Younger users will also be unable to use \"free-form 2D user creation\" from the same date, which it said were games \"that allow users to draw or write in 2D and replicate those creations to other users without the completed creation going through Roblox moderation\".",
      "It is thought that this is aimed at preventing users writing or drawing offensive images or messages which are difficult to moderate.",
      "\"We recognize the deadline is soon, but we greatly appreciate your cooperation in helping us ensure Roblox is a safe and civil place for users of all ages to come together,\" it said in a post on the Roblox developer website.",
      "Potential risks",
      "According to the media regulator Ofcom, Roblox is the most popular game in the UK for children aged 8 to 12.",
      "But it has faced criticism over its protections for younger users, with one young person telling the BBC in May he had been approached on Roblox and asked for sexual images.",
      "At the time, Ofcom, the regulator for online safety, told tech firms to hide \"toxic\" content from children and published draft codes of practice.",
      "Since then there have been further issues, with Turkey entirely blocking access to Roblox in August.",
      "\u201cAs a company that\u2019s transparent with our community of developers, we needed to share key information about the upcoming changes prior to launch,\" Roblox told the BBC in a statement.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re constantly strengthening our safety systems and policies \u2014 we shipped over 30 improvements this year and we have more to come,\u201d it added.",
      "But despite announcing the changes would begin swiftly, it said it would not begin enforcing the requirements until 2025."

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",

      "The regulator says a merger between Vodafone and Three could go ahead - if both companies make price promises for consumers and commit to boosting the UK's 5G rollout.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had previously said that creating what would be the country's biggest mobile network could drive up prices and harm competition.",

    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",

    "summary": "Start-up firms are looking for ways to dye clothes using less water and heat.",
    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

    "summary": "The move comes after US officials were quoted saying they would not accept Hamas's presence in Qatar.",
    "story": [
      "Qatar has suspended its work as a mediator in ceasefire and hostage release talks between Israel and Hamas, officials say.",
      "The country said it would resume its work when Hamas and Israel \"show their willingness\" to negotiate.",
      "It comes after senior US officials reportedly said Washington would no longer accept the presence of Hamas representatives in Qatar, accusing the Palestinian group of rejecting fresh proposals for an end to the war in Gaza.",
      "Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas's political office in Doha \"no longer serves its purpose\" were \"inaccurate\".",
      "\"Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,\" a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.",
      "\"Qatar will resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.\"",
      "Hamas has had a base in the Qatari capital since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.",
      "Several news agencies reported on Saturday that Qatar had agreed with the US to tell Hamas to close its political office in Doha due to \"a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith\".",
      "But the foreign ministry said the reports were \"inaccurate\". The claims have also been denied by Hamas officials.",
      "The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia.",
      "Alongside the US and Egypt, the Qataris have also played a major role in rounds of so-far unsuccessful talks to broker a ceasefire in the year-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.",
      "But there is growing evidence of a shift in the relationship.",
      "After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas held a two-hour mourning tent in Doha in a small hall, a stark contrast to the recent three-day mourning held for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which was conducted with official state oversight and security.",
      "The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. The group has always called for a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "The Qatari foreign ministry statement said: \"Media reports regarding the Hamas office in Doha is inaccurate.\"",
      "\"The main goal of the office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication... [which] has contributed to achieving a ceasefire in previous stages.\"",
      "Israel has also been accused of rejecting deals. Days after being fired earlier this week, former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of rejecting a peace deal against the advice of his security chiefs.",
      "The call for Hamas to be expelled from Qatar appears to be an attempt by the outgoing Biden administration to force some sort of peace deal before the end of his term in January.",
      "Were Hamas to be forced to leave Doha, it is unclear where they would base their political office. Key ally Iran would be an option, although the assassination of former leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July suggests they may be at risk from Israel if based there. It would also not give them anything close to the same diplomatic channels to the West.",
      "A more likely option would be Turkey. As a Nato member but also a Sunni majority state, it would give the group a base from which to operate in relative safety. Last April President Erdogan hosted then Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and his delegation in Istanbul, where they talked about \u201cwhat needs to be done to ensure adequate and uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and a fair and lasting peace process in the region\".",
      "The move would also most likely be welcomed by Ankara, which has often sought to position itself as a broker between east and west.",
      "Key Hamas figures such as Osama Hamdan, Taher al-Nunu, and others frequently featured on news outlets have been staying in Istanbul for over a month.",
      "Their extended presence in Turkey marks a departure from past visits, which were typically limited to brief stays.",
      "It is thought the personal safety of Hamas leadership is now a major concern for the group, which saw two leaders killed in less than four months. As well as Haniyeh\u2019s death in July, in October Israel killed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel.",
      "According to the European Council of Foreign Relations, \u201cHamas has adopted a temporary model of collective leadership to mitigate the effect of future Israeli assassinations\u201d.",
      "H A Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC that nowhere \u201cwill give them protection from Israeli assassination attempts in the same way that being in Doha, where America has its largest military base in the region, did\u201d.",
      "The latest move comes as US officials appear increasingly frustrated with the approach the Israeli government has taken to ending the war. In October, the US Secretaries of State and Defense said if Israel did not allow more humanitarian aid into the territory by 12 November, they would face unspecified policy \u201cimplications\u201d.",
      "Last weekend a number of UN officials warned the situation in northern Gaza was \u201capocalyptic\u201d. On Saturday the independent Famine Review Committee said there was a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas\u201d.",
      "The relationship between President Joe Biden and Netanyahu has deteriorated over the course of the war in Gaza, with increasing pressure from Washington to improve the humanitarian situation for the Palestinians and find some sort of negotiated settlement.",
      "Nearly 70% of Gaza war dead are women and children, UN says",
      "Gaza\u2019s top Islamic scholar issues fatwa criticising 7 October attack",
      "Palestinians leave Gaza in rare medical evacuation",
      "But, according to Dr Hellyer, US attempts at negotiation have been fatally flawed.",
      "\u201cBy setting red lines and allowing Netanyahu to cross them without consequence, the Biden administration effectively encouraged further impunity. I don\u2019t think any of this will change in the next 10 weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "Any overtures have been repeatedly rejected by Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition, who will now also feel emboldened by the prospect of an incoming Donald Trump presidency.",
      "While exactly what approach Trump will take to the region remains uncertain, he is thought to be more likely to allow Israel to act on its terms.",
      "He has previously said Israel should \u201cfinish what they started\u201d in Gaza. During his last term in the White House, he took a number of steps deemed highly favourable to Israel, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.",
      "It has also been reported, however, that Trump has told Netanyahu that he wants to see an end to the fighting by the time he takes office.",
      "Either way, it seems likely that the current US administration will have less influence over the government in Jerusalem.",
      "They may therefore believe the best way to force some sort of deal is to apply pressure on Hamas.  Whether it pays off may depend on whether Qatar, so long a reliable ally, decides to go along with it."

      "He said that Victor had explained to him how he\u2019d grabbed his sons in his arms as the water dragged them all outside.",
      "Then \u2013 despite his desperate efforts to keep hold of them - they were gone.",
      "Victor was found around four hours later, more than 200m away.",
      "He had been clinging to a tree.",
      "His mother \u2013 the boys' grandma \u2013 revealed that Victor had been ready to throw himself into the torrent and surrender to his fate, but then stopped.",

      "\u201cThey were such happy kids,\u201d she told us.",
      "Izan and Rub\u00e9n\u2019s parents had bought the property from a man called Francisco Javier Arona.",
      "Javi \u2013 as he\u2019s known - told EFE, the Spanish news agency, that the home had become \u201ca paradise\" for the Mat\u00edas family.",
      "He said he himself had lovingly constructed the house in La Curra, a neighbourhood of Mas del Jutge, in a colonial style over three years.",
      "Javi said he\u2019d affixed ornamental amphoras and delicate clay stars beneath a sweeping arch.",
      "Outside, there was little traffic in the cul-de-sac, meaning the boys could run around carefree with little perceptible danger.",
      "Family house surrounded by trucks",
      "The impending storm gathering on 29 October was a very big danger, and so Victor closed his business early and picked up his boys from the nursey so that he could keep them safe and dry at home, as the rain fell harder and harder.",
      "The force of the downpour became incredible, and soon the power was cut.",
      "The brothers\u2019 grandma, Antonia Mar\u00eda Mat\u00edas, a 72 year old cancer patient, told ABC Sevilla that she had called her son Victor at around 18:00 and heard the brothers crying.",

      "It may have been their haven, but the family home was also next to a lorry park.",
      "Jonathan Perez, their next door neighbour, explained to us how this played a deadly role.",
      "He said, \u201cThe father told us that there was a truck that hit the back of the house and the force of the water tore away everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cVictor regained his footing and carried the boys in his arms. But then he realised he no longer had them. The water took everything in its path,\u201d he explained.",
      "Barbara Sastre, the boy\u2019s aunt also told us at least one truck had sliced open the house in a blow that precipitated the boys and their dad being swept towards the nearby ravine.",
      "The unnamed owner of the parking lot from where the trucks came told one newspaper they had not hit the family house. He insisted it was the strength of the water that did the fatal damage.",
      "Jonathan, the neighbour, encapsulated the seething anger millions of Spaniards are feeling. Particularly, at the fact the official red alert sent to mobile phones came at 20:00 - far too late.",
      "\u201cThey were loving life and they hadn\u2019t even started being people, they were three and five years old,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWith better co-ordination, better management, and an earlier alarm \u2013 even half an hour earlier \u2013 those kids could have been saved and those parents would not be going through hell.\u201d",
      "The frantic search for the boys",
      "The whole neighbourhood in La Curra, stunned and shattered by the violence of the flooding, immediately began to search for the missing Izan and Rub\u00e9n.",
      "At least they did once the water had receded sufficiently for them to climb down from trees and clamber off their cars and try to reorientate themselves.",
      "They were helped by police officers from nearby Alicante, including a friend of Victor\u2019s, who quickly arrived and began a desperate search.",
      "But where to start?",
      "Cars, bricks, bed frames had been carried hundreds of metres from where they once stood.",

    "summary": "The smog covering Pakistan's second largest city has been captured in satellite images.",
    "story": [
      "Smog starts slow.",
      "At first, you cannot see it but you can smell it. It smells like something is burning. And it intensifies as the temperature drops.",
      "Then the smoke and fog start to envelop you and the city around you. Now you can see it. You are walking through the smoke, a thick ceiling of it hanging overhead.",
      "If you are not wearing a mask or you lower it for a moment, you will immediately inhale the bitter air.",
      "Your throat might start to feel itchy and sore. As it gets worse, you start sneezing and coughing. But it's worse for others: children, the elderly, those with breathing difficulties. The hospitals know to expect the influx.",
      "Lahore and its 13 million residents have now been choking for a week; the air quality index has passed the 1,000 mark repeatedly this month - anything above 300 is considered hazardous.",
      "Pakistani officials have scrambled to respond to the crisis - its scale unprecedented even in a city which deals with smog at this time each year.",
      "Schools are closed, workers have been told to stay home and people urged to stay indoors - part of a so-called \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d, which has also seen motorbike rickshaws, heavy vehicles and motorbike parking banned from hot spot areas.",
      "By the end of the week, Lahore High Court had ordered all the markets in the Punjab province to close by 20:00 each night, with complete closures on Sundays. Parks and zoos have also been shut until 17 November.",
      "The problem, according to Nasa scientist Pawan Gupta, is that pollution levels in the city \u201ctypically peak in late November and December\u201d.",
      "\u201cSo this is just beginning. The worst pollution days are probably still ahead of us,\u201d he warned.",
      "The smoke that has enveloped Lahore, in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province, can be seen from space - as can part of the cause.",
      "Satellite images from the US space agency Nasa shows both the thick layer of smog and the multiple concentrations of fire in the region between the Indian capital, Delhi, and Pakistan\u2019s Lahore.",
      "The same image, six weeks earlier, shows clear skies and - crucially - far fewer fires.",
      "A major cause of the smog is the fires which are caused by the burning of stubble after harvest by farmers in both Pakistan and India -  a quick way to clear their fields ready for the next crops.",
      "This year, Nasa estimates it will count \u201cbetween 15,500 and 18,500 fires \u201d, according to Hiren Jethva, a senior research scientist at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Morgan State University, higher than most years.",
      "According to Pakistan\u2019s environment protection authorities, around 30% of Lahore\u2019s smog comes from across the border in India. The Indian government has this year doubled fines for farmers caught stubble-burning as it tries to deal with the issue.",
      "But much of Lahore\u2019s air pollution comes from its five million motorbikes and millions of other vehicles\u2019 exhausts. On Friday, Lahore's high court identified heavy traffic emissions as the main cause of the smog, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.",
      "Then there are the industries in the city\u2019s outskirts - like the coal-fired brick kilns - adding even more pollution to the air.",
      "And in the final months of the year, it all combines with cold air flowing down from Tibet, creating the smog which is currently sitting over the city.",
      "It is clear the toxic air is making people sick.",
      "According to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI), a value of 50 or below indicates good air quality, while a value above 300 signals Hazardous air quality.",

      "He has already seen a surge in patients complaining of respiratory tract illnesses - \u201cparticularly worrying because we have not yet seen our first cold wave of the winter season\u201d.",
      "The danger is a constant concern for Lahore resident Sadia Kashif.",

      "\u201cI see my children struggle with coughs and breathing problems these days, and it is a painful reminder that our air has become extremely toxic.\u201d",
      "But the current \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d has left her unimpressed.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for the government to shut down school rather than taking real steps to address the crisis,\u201d says Kashif.",

      "In the meantime, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced this week she intends to write a letter to her counterpart in Indian Punjab to invite them to engage in \u201cclimate diplomacy\u201d, since it impacts both regions. Delhi says it is yet to hear from Pakistan on the issue.",

    "summary": "Dozens of videos involving a senior civil servant have flooded social media, shocking people in the central African country.",
    "story": [
      "What the rest of the world sees as a sex tape scandal could in fact be the latest episode in the real-life drama over who will become Equatorial Guinea\u2019s next president.",
      "Over the past fortnight, dozens of videos - estimates range from 150 to more than 400 - have been leaked of a senior civil servant having sex in his office and elsewhere with different women.",
      "They have flooded social media, shocking and titillating people in the small central African country and beyond.",
      "Many of the women filmed were wives and relatives of people close to the centre of power.",
      "It appears some were aware they were being filmed having sex with Baltasar Ebang Engonga, who is also known as \u201cBello\u201d because of his good looks.",
      "All this is hard to verify as Equatorial Guinea is a highly restricted society where a free press does not exist.",
      "But one theory is that the leaks were a way to discredit the man at the centre of the storm.",
      "Mr Engonga is a nephew of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and one of those thought to be hoping to replace him.",
      "Obiang is the world\u2019s longest-serving president having been in power since 1979.",
      "The 82-year-old has overseen an economic boom that has turned to bust as a result of the now-dwindling oil reserves.",
      "There is a small, extremely wealthy elite, but many of the 1.7 million people in the country live in poverty.",
      "Obiang\u2019s administration is heavily criticised for its human rights record, including arbitrary killings and torture, according to a US government report.",
      "It has also had its fair share of scandals - including the revelations about the lavish lifestyle of one of the president's sons, now vice-president, who once owned a $275,000 (\u00a3210,000) crystal-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson.",
      "Despite regular elections, there is no real opposition in Equatorial Guinea as activists have been jailed and exiled and those with designs on office are closely monitored.",
      "Politics in the country is really about palace intrigue and this is where the scandal involving Mr Engonga fits in.",
      "He was the head of the National Financial Investigation Agency, and worked on tackling crimes such as money laundering.",
      "But it turned out he himself was under investigation.",
      "He was arrested on 25 October accused of embezzling a huge sum of money from state coffers and depositing it in secret accounts in the Cayman Islands. He has not commented on the accusation.",
      "Mr Engonga was then taken to the infamous Black Beach prison in the capital, Malabo, where it is alleged that opponents of the government are subjected to brutal treatment.",
      "His phones and computers were seized and a few days later the intimate videos started appearing online.",
      "The first reference the BBC has found to them on Facebook is from 28 October on the page of Diario Rombe, a news site run by a journalist in exile in Spain, which said that \u201csocial networks exploded with the leaking of explicit images and videos\u201d.",
      "A post on X the following day referred to a \u201cmonumental scandal shaking the regime\u201d as \u201cpornographic videos flood social media\u201d.",
      "But they are believed to have originally appeared one-by-one a few days earlier on Telegram, on one of the platform's channels known for publishing pornographic images.",
      "They were then downloaded on to people\u2019s phones and shared among WhatsApp groups in Equatorial Guinea, where they caused a storm.",
      "Mr Engonga was quickly identified along with some of the women in the videos, including relatives of the president and wives to ministers and senior military officials.",
      "The government was unable to ignore what was going on and on 30 October Vice-President Teodoro Obiang Mangue (once owner of the Michael Jackson glove) gave telecoms companies 24 hours to come up with ways to stop the spread of the clips.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to watch families fall apart without taking any action,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, the origin of these publications is being investigated to find the author or authors and make them answer for their actions.\u201d",
      "As the computer equipment was in the hands of the security forces, suspicion has fallen on someone there, who, perhaps, sought to trash Mr Engonga\u2019s reputation ahead of a trial.",
      "The police have called on women to come forward to open a case against Mr Engonga for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. One has already announced that she is suing him.",
      "What is not clear is why Mr Engonga made the recordings.",
      "But activists have put forward what could be other motives behind the explosive leak.",
      "As well as being related to the president, Mr Engonga is the son of Baltasar Engonga Edjo'o, the head of the regional economic and monetary union, Cemac, and very influential in the country.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing is the end of an era, the end of the current president, and there is a succession [question] and this is the internal fighting we are seeing,\u201d said Equatoguinean activist Nsang Christia Esimi Cruz, now living in London.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Focus on Africa podcast, he alleged that Vice-President Obiang was trying to politically eliminate \u201canyone who could challenge his succession\u201d.",
      "The vice-president, along with his mother, are suspected to be pushing aside anyone who threatens his path to the presidency, including Gabriel Obiang Lima (another son of President Obiang from a different wife), who was oil minister for 10 years and then moved to a secondary government role.",
      "Those in the elite are thought to know things about each other that they would rather was not made public, and videos have been used in the past to humiliate and discredit a political opponent.",
      "There are also frequent accusations of coup plotting, which further fuels paranoia.",
      "But Mr Cruz also alleges that the authorities want to use the scandal as an excuse to crack down on social media, which is how a lot of information about what is really going on in the country gets out.",
      "In July, the authorities temporarily suspended the internet after protests broke out on the island of Annob\u00f3n.",
      "For him, the fact that a high-ranking official was having sex outside of marriage was not surprising as it was part of the decadent lifestyle of the country\u2019s elite.",
      "The vice-president, who himself has been convicted of corruption in France and has had lavish assets seized in various countries, wants to be seen as the man cracking down on graft and wrong-doing at home.",
      "Last year, for example, he ordered the arrest of his half-brother over allegations he sold a plane owned by the state airline.",
      "But in this case, despite the vice-president\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of the clips, they continue to be viewed.",
      "This week, he tried to appear more resolute calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in government offices \u201cto combat indecent and illicit acts\u201d, the official news agency reported.",
      "Saying that the scandal had \u201cdenigrated the image of the country\u201d he ordered that any officials found engaging in sex acts at work would be suspended as this was a \"flagrant violation of the code of conduct\u201d.",
      "He was not wrong that the story has attracted a lot of outside interest.",
      "Judging by Google's data, search enquiries that include the country\u2019s name have shot up since the beginning of this week.",
      "On Monday, on X, \u201cEquatorial Guinea\u201d was one of the top trending terms in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa - surpassing at times interest in the US election.",
      "This has left some activists who have been trying to tell the world about what is really going on in the country frustrated.",
      "\u201cEquatorial Guinea has much bigger problems than this sex scandal,\u201d said Mr Cruz, who works for a rights organisation called GE Nuestra.",

      "The 20,000 cap is likely to only lead to tourists being turned away on a handful of occasions. A spokesperson for the park told Reuters that it had only exceeded 20,000 visitors when entry is free on the first Sunday of the month, as well as three or four fee-paying days.",

      "Having claimed for months that he wanted his government to serve its full term into next year, the temptation of positive polls has clearly proved too much.",
      "In October the three parties of government agreed that the general election would take place this year - yesterday Harris officially called the election and asked the President Higgins to dissolve the D\u00e1il.",
      "But while this is the first major electoral test for the Fine Gael leader, for his political opponents there is just as much at stake.",
      "At the last general election four years ago, Sinn F\u00e9in - the main opposition party in the Republic - surprised political rivals and pundits alike when they made significant gains, winning 37 seats and securing the most first preference votes of any party.",
      "It marked a break with the two-party governing system, traditionally dominated by Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, signalling a huge shift in support for the all-island party.",
      "Senior party members acknowledged their tactics had been too cautious and could have won more seats if they had run more candidates.",
      "They declared victory even though the larger parties refused to enter government with them, and insisted next time round that party president Mary Lou McDonald would be elected as the first female taoiseach (Irish prime minister).",
      "But this time, there is little to no expectation of the party managing a repeat performance.",
      "The first sign that all was not well came in the form of disappointing local government and European election results over the summer.",

      "Bonanza budget",
      "As for Fine Gael, Simon Harris goes into this election hoping for stronger results than his predecessor Leo Varadkar managed in 2020, when the party lost 15 seats.",
      "Unable to form a government by itself, it sought to form a coalition government with Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green Party - an agreement that took four months to negotiate.",
      "There is no doubt Fine Gael has felt a bounce with Harris stepping into the top job.",
      "He still faces a challenge to prove to voters that his party should continue to govern after almost two decades, but having thrown the electorate a bonanza budget with extra cash for lots of sectors, hope is high in the party that it will see an improved performance.",

      "First as taoiseach, taking over from Leo Varadkar for the first half of the term as part of the coalition arrangements, before becoming T\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) and Ireland's foreign affairs minister in 2022 - a role that has seen him heavily engaged in political events north of the border too.",
      "His party narrowly won the most seats in 2020, pipping Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s 37 seats with just one more.",
      "Recent polls have shown the party sitting on about 20%.",
      "Whether the party does better than last time or struggles against Fine Gael will determine how Fianna F\u00e1il views Miche\u00e1l Martin\u2019s future as leader, after 13 years in the job.",
      "The success of independent candidates and some of the smaller parties in the recent council elections is a factor that could back come into play this time.",

    "title": "How would Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of migrants work?",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 03:29:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would face legal and practical challenges - and cost billions.",
    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, saying the cost of doing so will not be a deterrent.",
      "In some of his first public remarks since winning the election, Trump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border \u201cstrong and powerful\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not - really, we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC News.",
      "But how would Trump\u2019s campaign pledge of mass deportations of migrants actually work and what are the hurdles he may face?",
      "What are the legal challenges?",
      "The latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a number that has remained relatively stable since 2005.",
      "Most are long-term residents - nearly four-fifths have been in the country for more than a decade.",
      "Immigrants who are in the country without legal status have the right to due process, including a court hearing before their removal. A drastic increase in deportations would likely entail a large expansion in the immigration court system, which has been beset by backlogs.",
      "Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement.",
      "However, many of the country\u2019s largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice.",
      "Trump has pledged to take action against these \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, but America\u2019s patchwork of local, state and federal laws further complicates the picture.",

      "In maps and charts: How small gains delivered Trump a big win",
      "These are the seven things Trump says he will do as president",
      "Analysis - Why Kamala Harris lost",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a \"critical\" aspect of any mass deportation programme.",
      "\"It's much easier for Ice to pick someone up from a jail if local law enforcement co-operates, instead of having to go look for them,\" she said.",
      "As an example, Ms Bush-Joseph pointed to an early August declaration from the sheriff's offices of Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties, in which they said they would not deploy deputies to help any mass deportation plan.",
      "\"There are many others who would not co-operate with a Trump mass deportation plan,\" she said. \"That makes it so much harder.\"",
      "Any mass deportation programme is also likely to be almost immediately met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "A 2022 Supreme Court ruling, however, means that courts cannot issue injunctions on immigration enforcement policies - meaning they would continue even as the challenges work their way through the legal system.",
      "But can it be done, logistically?",
      "If a US administration was able to legally move ahead with plans for mass deportations, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges.",
      "During the Biden administration, deportation efforts have focused on migrants recently detained at the border. Migrants deported from further inland in the US, from areas not located near the border, are, overwhelmingly, those with criminal histories or deemed national security threats.",
      "Controversial raids on worksites that were carried out during the Trump administration were suspended in 2021.",
      "Deportations of people arrested in the US interior - as opposed to those at the border - have hovered at below 100,000 for a decade, after peaking at over 230,000 during the early years of the Obama administration.",
      "\"To raise that, in a single year, up to a million would require a massive infusion of resources that likely don't exist,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the BBC.",
      "For one, experts are doubtful that Ice's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down even a fraction of the figures being touted by the Trump campaign.",
      "Mr Reichlin-Melnick added that the deportation process is long and complicated and only begins with the identification and arrest of an undocumented migrant.",
      "After that, detainees would need to be housed or placed on an \"alternative to detention\" programme before they are brought before an immigration judge, in a system with a years-long backlog.",
      "Only then are detainees removed from the US, a process that requires diplomatic co-operation from the receiving country.",
      "\"In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.",
      "Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.",
      "Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.",
      "Aside from the use of the military and \"using local law enforcement\", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine earlier this year, the former president said only that he would \"not rule out\" building new migrant detention facilities, and that he would move to give police immunity from prosecution from \"the liberal groups or the progressive groups\".",
      "He added that there could also be incentives for state and local police departments to participate, and that those who do not \"won't partake in the riches\".",
      "\"We have to do this,\" he said. \"This is not a sustainable problem for our country.\"",
      "Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement.",
      "\"That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,\" he said. \"That's what keeps people showing up.\"",
      "Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary.",
      "\"They're coming for jobs,\" he said. \"And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.\"",
      "The financial and political costs",
      "Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (\u00a3327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people.",
      "Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.",
      "The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.",
      "Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.",
      "\"Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. \"A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.\"",
      "Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border.",
      "Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that \"nightmarish images\" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.",
      "\"Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,\" Mr Isacson said.",
      "\"You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,\" he added. \"All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.\"",
      "Have mass deportations happened before?",
      "Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.",
      "The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
      "During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the \"deporter-in-chief\".",
      "The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people.",
      "That figure is disputed by historians, however.",
      "The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.",
      "Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.",
      "\"Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,\" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.",
      "\"Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,\" she added.",
      "\"Those are not comparable situations.\"",

      "Until recently, just 350 people lived on Agalega, fishing and growing coconuts. Other food was delivered four times a year by ship from the capital of Mauritius, 1,100km (680 miles) to the south. A small airstrip was rarely used except in medical emergencies.",
      "But in 2015, Mauritius, an island nation of which Agalega is a part, signed a deal enabling India to build a vast 3,000m runway and a big new jetty there, as part of the two countries' deepening collaboration on maritime security.",

      "A carpet of palm trees has made way for the runway, which stretches along the spine of the north island between the two main villages - La Fourche in the north and Vingt-Cinq further south.",
      "Two 60m-wide buildings can be seen sitting on a tarmac apron, at least one of which could be a hangar to accommodate the Indian navy\u2019s P-8I aircraft, according to Samuel Bashfield, a PhD scholar at the Australian National University.",

      "\u201cAs newer satellite images become available, we\u2019ll better understand Agalega\u2019s role in Indian Ocean communications,\u201d he says.",
      "The International Institute for Strategic Studies refers to the facility as a \u201csurveillance station\u201d and says it is likely to contain a coastal radar surveillance system similar to Indian-built equipment elsewhere in Mauritius.",
      "The Indian government declined to answer questions about Agalega, and referred the BBC to earlier statements on its website. In one of these, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India and Mauritius were \"natural partners\" in maritime security, facing traditional and non-traditional challenges in the Indian Ocean region.",
      "The two countries have had a close defence relationship since the 1970s. The country\u2019s national security adviser, its coastguard chief and the head of the police helicopter squadron are all Indian nationals and officers in India's external intelligence agency, navy and air force, respectively.",

      "While it\u2019s not unusual for a large country to establish a military outpost on the territory of a smaller ally, the construction work on Agalega has troubled some islanders.",
      "A number of areas, including some of the island\u2019s palm-fringed white-sand beaches, have already been cordoned off, islanders say. There are also persistent rumours that the village of La Fourche will be swallowed by the Indian infrastructure that has grown up around it, and that the 10 families who live there will be forced out.",
      "\"It will become a restricted area completely for Indians,\" says Laval Soopramanien, president of the Association of Friends of Agalega.",

This gradually became a fully-fledged military base.",
      "Billy Henri fears that the Mauritius government, which owns all land on Agalega and is the only employer, is trying to make conditions so miserable that everyone will leave.",

      "The Mauritius and Indian governments say the improvements to sea and air transportation were designed to benefit the islanders and help lift them out of poverty. But local people say this hasn\u2019t happened: there are still only four ferries to the main island of Mauritius every year, and no passenger flights.",
      "Agalegans say they are barred from a new Indian-built hospital, even though a Mauritius government press release vaunted its operating theatres, X-ray machines and dentistry equipment.",

      "\"Baalbek is the major Roman site in Lebanon. You couldn't replace it if someone bombed it,\" says Graham Philip, an archaeology professor at Durham University.",
      "\"It would be a huge loss. It would be a crime.\"",

      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has largely been targeting southern Lebanon, suburbs in the capital Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley.",
      "But in the past fortnight, the campaign has moved into new areas, or rather, very old ground.",
      "The IDF told the BBC that it only targets military sites. But those targets are incredibly close to the Baalbek temples and Roman ruins in Tyre, a major port of the Phoenician Empire around 2,500 years ago.",
      "According to legend, Tyre is the place where purple pigment was first created - the dye crushed out of snail shells to embroider royal robes.",
      "On 23 October, the IDF issued evacuation orders for neighbourhoods close to the city's Roman ruins, including the remains of a necropolis and a hippodrome.",
      "Hours later it began striking targets. More bombing of the sites was reported last week.",
      "Videos from the strikes showed huge clouds of black smoke rising from seafront areas only a few hundred metres from the ruins.",

      "\"Each strike that poses a risk to a sensitive structure is weighed carefully and goes through a rigorous approval process as required.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:01:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The birth of a great Indian bustard chick through artificial insemination has given hope to conservationists.",
    "story": [
      "Last month brought good news for the great Indian bustard, a critically endangered bird found mainly in India.",
      "Wildlife officials in the western state of Rajasthan have performed the first successful hatching of a chick through artificial insemination.",
      "A lone adult male in one of two breeding centres in Jaisalmer city was trained to produce sperm without mating, which was then used to impregnate an adult female at the second centre some 200km (124 miles) away.",
      "Officials said the development was important as it has opened up the possibility of creating a sperm bank.",
      "Over the years, habitat loss, poaching and collisions with overhead power lines have effected great Indian bustards. Their numbers have fallen from more than 1,000 in the 1960s to around 150 at present.",
      "Most of them are found in Jaisalmer and hence, conservation activists say that the bird's habitat in the city should be protected. But this land is also prime real estate for renewable energy firms, presenting authorities with a unique conservation challenge.",
      "The great Indian bustard may not be as well known as the peacock (India's national bird) but it's just as impressive, says Sumit Dookia, a conservation ecologist who has been studying the bird for close to a decade. The massive bird, which weighs between 15kg and 18kg, is one of the biggest flying birds in India.",
      "It once had a prolific presence in the country and was found in at least 11 states, but today, its population is confined to Rajasthan, while a handful might be spotted in the southern state of Karnataka and the western state of Gujarat.",
      "The shy bird plays an important role in the food chain by preying on rodents, snakes and other pests and is also the state bird of Rajasthan, where it is called 'Godawan' by locals.",
      "But some of the bird's unique evolutionary traits are clashing with human interventions, making it vulnerable to extinction.",
      "For one, the great Indian bustard has good peripheral vision but poor frontal vision, making it difficult for them to spot power lines until they fly too close to them. Their large size makes it difficult for them to quickly change their flight path and they end up colliding with the cables and dying.",
      "\"Their vision could have developed like this as the bird spends a large amount of time on land,\" says Mr Dookia. It also lays its eggs on the ground, without a nest or any other form of protection except for the watchful eye of the mother and this might have caused it to develop good side vision, he adds.",
      "The great Indian bustard also has unique breeding habits. The bird lays just one egg at a time and spends the next two years caring for its offspring.",
      "\"Since it reaches maturity at around four years of age and lives for 12-15 years, it lays just about four-five eggs in its lifetime and many of these eggs are destroyed by predators,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "Conservationists say that over the past few years, the great Indian bustard's habitat in Jaisalmer has been overrun by solar and wind energy farms, leading to an increase in flying accidents.",
      "\"The increased human presence has also created more filth, attracting stray dogs who kill the birds or destroy their eggs,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "To boost the bird's population, the government of Rajasthan collaborated with the federal government and the Wildlife Institute of India to launch a conservation breeding centre at Sam city in 2018. Another breeding centre was set up at Ramdevra village in 2022, says Ashish Vyas, a top forest official in Jaisalmer.",
      "As a first step, researchers collected eggs found in the wild and hatched them in incubation centres. \"Currently, there are 45 birds in both the centres,14 of which are captive-bred chicks (including the one born through artificial insemination),\" he adds.",
      "The plan is to further boost the bird's population and then eventually release them into the wild. But conservationists say that this is easier said than done.",
      "This is because the birds born in these breeding centres have imprinted on human researchers (in other words, they have formed close bonds with their human caretakers) and have lost about 60-70% of their ability to survive in the wild, says Mr Dookia.",
      "\"Human imprinting is necessary for feeding and handling the birds but it also makes them lose their natural instincts. It will be extremely challenging to re-wild them, especially if there's no habitat left for the birds to be released into,\" he adds.",
      "The loss of habitat has also resulted in another problem: researchers have noticed that the birds, which used to migrate across states, have almost completely stopped doing so. Even in Jaisalmer, where the birds are found in two pockets - Pokhran in the eastern part of the city and the Desert National Park in the west - there's hardly any cross-migration, says Mr Dookia.",
      "It's likely that the birds have stopped migrating over large distances in response to flying accidents, he adds. This increases the risk of inbreeding, which could result in birth defects.",
      "\"Thus, the only solution to conserve the great Indian bustard is to preserve its natural habitat,\" he says.",
      "But a Supreme Court judgement from April has made conservationists uneasy.",
      "The court overturned an earlier interim order, which had instructed Rajasthan and Gujarat to prioritise moving power cables underground in great Indian bustard habitats. The order had created a furore among renewable energy firms, who said that this would cost them billions of rupees and virtually kill their business.",

      "One person, who authorities say spent time with Payne every day while he was in Buenos Aires, is charged with abandonment of a person followed by death, a charge that carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office released Thursday.",
      "The other two charged are accused of supplying Payne with drugs, including cocaine, and have been charged with two acts each of supplying narcotics. Officials did not say what the sentence for those charges could be.",
      "One of the people charged with supplying narcotics is a hotel employee, the prosecutor's office said. The three people charged have been notified of the charges, the prosecutor's office said, and have been prohibited from leaving the country.",

      "The release also stated that Payne died from a fall, and had not jumped from the balcony.

      "\"For the prosecution, this situation would also rule out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act on the part of the victim,\" the prosecutor's office said.",
      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",
      "Toxicology tests conducted as part of the autopsy showed that Payne \"only had traces\" of drug use in his system. There were \"traces\" of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant, the prosecutor's office said. Medical experts found that Payne only had injuries from his fall.",
      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases. Bruniard approved the charges against the three people, but the investigation will continue, the prosecutor's office said, as investigators continue to try to access Payne's other personal devices.",

      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

      "In the case of Byron, NASCAR ruled that Ross Chastain and Austin Dillon both ran interference to help fellow Chevrolet driver Byron not lose any position on the track that would cost him a spot in the championship.",
      "Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said the sanctioning body considered suspending the drivers as well as taking action against manufacturers Chevrolet and Toyota. He said there was nothing in the rulebook that would call for the manufacturers to be punished, but NASCAR planned to meet with the leaders of Ford, Chevy and Toyota to discuss the situation.",
      "Because the penalties were issued the week of the season finale, the teams have until Wednesday afternoon to ask for an expedited appeal. The appeals would likely be heard Thursday.",
      "Trackhouse Racing, which fields Chastain's Chevy, said it would appeal, as did 23XI for the Wallace's Toyota.",

    "summary": "Republicans' newly won control of the Senate may have buoyed Kennedy's odds of a role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",
      "\"Make no mistake, what is being discussed is a major reimagining of the entire federal health research and promotion and protection infrastructure. That includes very significant reforms and changes in business practice,\" said Malone.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",

      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",
      "He added, \"Overall, we're expecting a whole percentage point this year and another percentage point next year, so that's going to lower interest rates on auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, et cetera.\"",
      "Analysts with Capital Economics predicted the Fed would drop its benchmark rate by a quarter point at each of its next three meetings, with the rate bottoming out in May between 3.50% and 3.75%.",
      "Will Trump win affect the Fed's thinking?",
      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected. We expect the same to occur in December,\" Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in an email.",

    "summary": "The largest private prison companies in the U.S. stand to benefit from Trump's vow to increase deportations.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could be a boon for business for private prison companies in the U.S. if the president-elect delivers on his promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "CoreCivic and Geo Group, the two biggest private prison operators in the U.S., both contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to house detained, undocumented migrants. Their stocks soared Wednesday following Trump's election win, with investors betting the companies will see increased profits from a tough-on-immigration administration.",
      "CoreCivic, which closed at $13.50 a share on November 5, is trading at $22 a share, while Geo Group, which closed at $15 a share Tuesday, is currently trading at $23.75.",
      "\"Obviously, investors believe there is going to be a significant increase in opportunity for both of these firms under the Trump administration,\" Noble Capital Markets analyst Joe Gomes told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "CoreCivic executives also said they believe the election result will drive demand for its services.",
      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",
      "Geo Group executives said they have the necessary technology and staffing resources to scale up the contract to more than several million participants, if necessary.",
      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA says oral phenylephrine, used in many over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, \"is not effective as a nasal decongestant.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",

      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",

The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve said it is cutting rates by 0.25 percentage points, its second rate cut of the year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday made its second rate cut of this year, with the decision coming less than two months after the central bank's surprise jumbo cut in September.",
      "The Fed shaved borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points, or half the size of its September reduction, according to its Thursday\u00a0statement. That brings down the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for borrowing money \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "With the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure dropping to 2.1% last month, just shy of the Fed's 2% goal, the central bank is easing off the brakes it applied when inflation hit a 40-year high during the pandemic. High borrowing costs have made it more expensive to buy everything from homes to cars.",
      "The Fed's 0.25 percentage point cut will provide some added relief for consumers, although the initial benefit will be small, experts say. The Fed is expected to continue cutting rates at its next several meetings, which could snowball into bigger savings for borrowers.",
      "\"Once a few more cuts happen over the next few months, the impact will add up to something that moves the needle for the average person struggling with debt,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, in an email. \"For now, however, the effect of these cuts won't be very noticeable.\"",
      "At a Thursday press conference to discuss the decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that Americans \"are still feeling the effects of high prices\" despite the slowdown in inflation.",
      "\"I think what needs to happen is happening, but it'll be some time before people regain their confidence,\" he added. \"We don't tell people how to feel about the economy \u2014 we completely respect what they are feeling.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Thursday's Fed meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate decision?",
      "The Fed\u00a0announced its decision at 2 p.m. ET on Nov. 7. That was followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.",
      "The next Fed rate decision will be announced on Dec. 18.",
      "How will the election impact the Fed's decision?",
      "The November 7 meeting is the first Fed rate decision since the Nov. 5 election propelled former\u00a0President Donald Trump to victory.",
      "Although Fed chief Powell was asked about the potential impact of Trump's policies on monetary policy and the economy during today's press conference, he shied away from commenting about the election. He also added that the election won't have a near-term impact on the Fed's decisions, with the central bank instead relying on economic data.",
      "\"We don't know what the timing or substance of any policy changes will be,\" Powell said. \"We don't guess, we don't speculate and we don't assume.\"",
      "Powell has long stressed the independence of the central bank and that its officials make their decisions based on data, not politics.",
      "Even so, Trump's policies could make the Fed's job more difficult, given that the president-elect's combination of tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is expected to boost prices by as much as 1 percentage point at a time when inflation is close to the Fed's goal of an annual 2% rate.",
      "If Trump's policies reignite inflation, the Fed would be hard-pressed to continuing easing borrowing costs, and could instead be forced to raise rates to counter those inflationary pressures.",
      "How low will rates go in 2024?",
      "The Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% at its December meeting. That would reflect a full percentage point cut from its pre-September level, when the federal funds rate was at its highest in more than two decades.",
      "But that doesn't mean mortgage rates or other borrowing costs will decline to that level, as lenders like mortgage companies and credit card companies make money by charging higher terms to consumers than the federal funds rate.",
      "Even so, borrowers should see some relief. Already, credit card rates are slightly lower, although they still remain close to record highs, according to Schulz.",
      "\"While they'll almost certainly continue to fall in coming months, no one should expect dramatically reduced credit card bills anytime soon,\" he added. \"Unless the Fed dramatically accelerates its pace of rate cuts, it'll still be a while before these reductions add up to more than just a few dollars per month coming off your bill.\"",
      "Will mortgage rates drop?",
      "Despite the Fed's September cut, mortgage rates have increased over the last month, with the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan sitting at about 6.72%, according to Freddie Mac. That's up from a September low of 6.08%.",
      "Even though the Fed's rate decisions impact mortgage rates, home borrowing costs are also affected by economic trends such as unemployment. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have been on the rise due to concerns about rising U.S. debt and the presidential election.",

      "The shares have been on a wild ride since going public in March, initially surging and giving former president's 57% stake a value of\u00a0$5.2 billion.

      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",
      "Still, Stovall notes a mathematician might scoff at basing a model on such a limited sample, in this case the 21 presidential elections held in the U.S. since World War II.",

      "In two key battlegrounds \u2014 Arizona and Nevada \u2014 voters backed measures that added the right to abortion to their state's constitution, but nonetheless, Harris trails Donald Trump in the vote count in these states. CBS News has projected Nevada and Arizona for Trump.",
      "Here's what the exit polls tell us about voters who \"split their ticket:\"",
      "Voters favored abortion rights but the economy mattered more",
      "Most people who voted \"yes\" on abortion-related measures \u2014 Proposition 139 in Arizona and Question 6 in Nevada \u2014 also voted for Kamala Harris, but about a quarter of these voters backed Donald Trump.",
      "For this group of voters, the economy was their top issue when voting for president. A majority described their finances as worse off compared to four years ago, so abortion rights mattered to them,\u00a0 but when it came to voting for president, other issues mattered to them more. These voters were also looking for a candidate who would bring needed change.",
      "Across nearly every major demographic group in Nevada, more voted for the right to abortion referendum than they did for Harris, according to exit polls. This includes both men and women, younger voters and independents.",
      "Kamala Harris made an appeal to Republicans, particularly Republican women, often on the issue of abortion rights, but few voted for her. A third of Republican women in Nevada voted \"yes\" on the right to abortion, but Harris had just single-digit support from these voters.",
      "We see the same pattern among Latino voters, too, a group Harris lost ground with relative to Joe Biden in 2020. Majorities of Latino men and women in Nevada voted in favor of the state's abortion ballot measure, but fewer of them backed Harris.",
      "In CBS News pre-election polling, we found that Harris' campaign argument that Trump would try to put a national abortion ban in place did not resonate with most voters outside the Democratic Party.\u00a0Voters were more apt to believe Trump would leave the matter of abortion to the states, so this may have been on the minds of the voters who backed abortion rights in their own state but also backed Trump.",

    "story": [
      "For more than a century, President Grover Cleveland was in a league of his own as the only leader of the nation to serve non-consecutive terms\u00a0as the 22nd and 24th president of the U.S. Now, Cleveland shares that honor with President-elect Donald Trump, who was the 45th president of the U.S. and will soon take office as the 47th. But in Cleveland's hometown, locals still want to preserve his legacy.",
      "Cleveland was born the fifth of nine children in Caldwell, New Jersey, about 20 miles outside of New York City. His humble home was near the Presbyterian church where his father was a pastor. Now, his birthplace is across the street from a gas station and donut shop, and it remains a tour site \u2014 though some days, no one comes to visit, according to tour guide Sharon Farrell.",
      "Nationwide, there's little to mark Cleveland, except for a rest area off the New Jersey turnpike. But in Caldwell, he's still inspiring some residents.",
      "\"How could you not be inspired?\" said Carlos Pomares, who said that Cleveland was his inspiration to run for a local country commission. \"The guy had a meteoric rise in a matter of four years, based on just being a hard worker, honest, brutally honest at times, and being one who just stuck to his beliefs.\"",
      "Pomares' home is filled with Cleveland-related pieces of history, including ribbons, busts and a Grover Cleveland brandy bottle. Throughout the town, there are multiple places named for the former president, including apartments, a park and a middle school. There's even a parking spot reserved for him.",
      "Cleveland didn't spend his whole life in Caldwell. During the middle of his life, he was a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, living in a small apartment above his law practice, according to author Troy Senik, who wrote \"A Man of Iron,\" a biography chronicling Cleveland's life. Later, he would be the mayor of Buffalo and the governor of New York.",
      "Cleveland's two presidential terms",
      "Even before his run for president, Cleveland was seen as principled and ethical. He was drafted by Democratic party bosses to run for president amid an era of corruption, patronage and unethical powerbrokers, and took office for the first time in 1885. He made history, but not headlines.",
      "\"If you're looking at the late 19th century, if you're looking at the Gilded Age, the debates are about tariffs. They're about silver in the money supply. They're about pensions for union veterans. We don't know how to think about any of these things,\" Senik said. \"It's not exciting stuff.\"",
      "Cleveland lost his re-election race to Indiana Republican Benjamin Harrison in 1888, though he won the popular vote. He was initially content with his retirement and \"somewhat relieved,\" feeling that \"he had done a decent job in his first term,\" according to Senik.",
      "But in 1892, he was again pressured by party leaders to run. He narrowly vanquished Harrison and moved back into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 something his wife, who he married during his first term, always believed would happen.",
      "In the final days of Cleveland's first term, Frances Folsom told \"a member of the domestic staff in the White House 'Make sure that you pack up everything very carefully because we want it to be just where we remember it when we come back,'\" according to Senik.",
      "\"The staffer assumes that they're planning to visit in the Harrison administration. 'Mrs. Cleveland, when will that be?'\" Senik said. \"And she said, 'We're coming back four years from today.'\"",

      "Pardoning Jan. 6 rioters",
      "Trump has praised those who breached the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, as \"patriots\" and referred to them as \"hostages\" of a Justice Department \"weaponized\" against him. He has said that those who were arrested as a result of their actions during the Capitol riot should be freed, and he vowed to pardon a \"large portion\" of the more than 1,000 people who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to crimes stemming from the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "Even before his election victory, defendants were trying to delay their cases, anticipating pardons. At least one defendant invoked Trump's win in an effort to delay proceedings in his case; lawyers for 21-year-old Christopher Carnell said in a filing the day after the election that Trump has \"made multiple clemency promises\" to Jan. 6 defendants and wrote that Carnell is \"expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\"",
      "They said Carnell \"is now awaiting further information from the Office of the President-elect regarding the timing and expected scope of clemency actions relevant to his case.\" His request was swiftly denied.",
      "At a recent Trump rally in North Carolina, an attendee yelled at Trump to \"pardon the January sixers.\" Trump looked at the man and replied, \"Yeah, it's true.\"",
      "Firing special counsel Jack Smith",
      "Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt recently that he'd fire special counsel Jack Smith, who has brought two federal criminal indictments against him, \"within two seconds\" of becoming president. Smith was appointed independent special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to oversee Trump's federal criminal investigations and cases.",
      "Dispensing with criminal cases against him",
      "The Justice Department and special counsel Jack Smith's office are engaged in active discussions about how to wind down the ongoing federal prosecutions against President-elect Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the talks.",
      "At the center of the discussions is the Justice Department's longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president and the need to enable a smooth transition to a second term in the White House for Trump, the sources said.",
      "Experts told CBS News the Justice Department is likely to drop Trump's federal criminal cases. Smith charged Trump with four counts stemming from his conduct after the 2020 election, as he and others sought to overturn his defeat in that race.",
      "That case appeared to be heading for a spring 2024 trial before Trump's lawyers appealed a decision related to presidential immunity to the Supreme Court, which in July concluded former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts during their time in office.",
      "In a separate federal criminal case in Florida, Trump was accused of mishandling sensitive government records. The judge dismissed the case in July, ruling Smith had been unlawfully appointed special counsel by the attorney general. Smith has appealed the decision.",
      "If he had been convicted in the federal cases, he could have tried to pardon himself because the Constitution confers broad pardon power. But Trump can't pardon himself from his New York conviction in a case stemming from a \"hush money\" payment because that's a state offense. His sentencing date is set for Nov. 26, but it remains to be seen whether that will go forward.",
      "Trump could simply move to dismiss the cases against him, said Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law scholar at Harvard Law School.",
      "\"He won't have to pardon himself \u2014 as the chief executive and chief law enforcement office of the U.S. government, he can simply order that the prosecutions be dismissed,\" Tushnet said.",
      "In Fulton County, Georgia, Trump's 2020 election interference case has been delayed amid allegations of impropriety against the district attorney. That delay is likely to now be extended.",
      "Lead Trump attorney Steve Sadow told a judge in a hearing last December that proceedings would not be pushed off indefinitely if Trump won the presidency, suggesting 2029 is the year the trial could resume.",
      "Exerting more influence on the Federal Reserve",
      "Trump has given mixed responses on the future of the Federal Reserve chair he appointed in 2018, Jerome Powell. In February, Trump said he wouldn't reappoint Powell.",
      "But after Trump won this year's presidential election, Powell said he would not leave if asked to resign by Trump. Powell's term expires in 2026.",
      "In February, Trump said he had a \"couple of choices\" for Fed chair, but didn't say who those options might be.",
      "Trump has accused Powell of being \"political.\" However, in July, he told Bloomberg Businessweek, \"I would let him serve it out,\" Trump said, and he added, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Beyond the question of who would lead the Fed is a bigger issue: Trump has previously said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions \u2014 a risk to the central bank's historical independence from political meddling, according to experts.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\" Trump said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",
      "Trump will expect the Fed to support economic growth by continuing to ease borrowing costs for consumers and businesses while containing inflation. That amounts to a delicate balancing act, given some of the president-elect's key economic policies, like imposing stiff new tariffs, boosting federal spending and deporting undocumented immigrants, could lead to higher prices.",
      "Nominating new Supreme Court justices",
      "Supreme Court justices sometimes try to time their retirements with a presidential administration corresponding to the party of the president who appointed them. When Trump takes office, there will be three justices who were appointed by previous Republican presidents \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Trump nominated the other three members of the conservative wing during his first term \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.",
      "Thomas is the longest-serving member of the court, having been nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 1991. Roberts and Alito were both tapped for the court by President George W. Bush in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Thomas, 76, and Alito, 74, are also the two oldest members of the Supreme Court.",
      "None of those three justices have publicly indicated an interest in leaving the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump's Supreme Court nominations during his first term widened the court's conservative majority from 6-3, and replacing any of the three other members would maintain that ideological split.",
      "Any nominations during Trump's second term would likely be of younger judges who could serve for decades, ensuring a conservative hold on the court for years to come. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were in their 50s when he nominated them, and Barrett was 48.",
      "Trump told CBS News in August that he'd release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees ahead of the election, but that list never arrived.",
      "Deporting undocumented migrants en masse",
      "At his final campaign stop in Pennsylvania before Election Day, Trump again promised to start mass deportations, but acknowledged \"it's terrible to do.\"",
      "\"I don't want to do that. I'm not looking to do that,\" Trump said. \"I think it's terrible to do, but we have no choice.\"",
      "Nearly 80% of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have been in the country a decade or more, and millions of them work and have families here. A concerted effort to round up, detain and deport people by the millions would not only raise legal and human rights concerns, it would cost billions of dollars a year.",
      "But Trump told NBC News after winning the election that there is \"no price tag.\"",
      "\"It's not a question of a price tag,\" he told NBC, adding, \"We have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. There is no price tag.\"",
      "Trump has said he may start with deporting undocumented migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado \u2014 two communities targeted by his campaign rhetoric. He said in his debate with Harris that in Springfield, migrants were \"eating the dogs\" and cats, and said of Aurora that it was being overrun by Venezuelan gangs. Local and state officials of both parties disputed Trump's claims.",
      "Rolling back climate and clean energy policies",
      "Trump has long cast doubts on the threat of climate change and prioritized increasing U.S. oil and gas production. \"Drill, baby, drill\" became a refrain at campaign rallies. He has vowed to unlock new lands for drilling, expedite drilling permits and speed up approval of natural gas pipelines.",
      "Trump has also expressed desire to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act and redistribute any unspent climate funds, which, among other things, support electric vehicle production, EV tax credits, and incentives for battery production and critical mineral mining.",
      "Such a move could prove unpopular with consumers, the automotive industry and even some members of his own party, who have recently supported certain programs funded by the IRA that have brought major manufacturing projects and jobs to conservative districts. Eliminating the individual tax credits for EV could be catastrophic for the automotive industry, which continues to see EV sales numbers grow, and many companies are basing production goals on these growing sales numbers. If the tax incentive is revoked, it would make EVs more expensive and harder to sell.",
      "One of Trump's most prominent backers, billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has benefitted from EV incentives.",
      "During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which included national goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Biden later rejoined the accords.",
      "Trump's record on climate issues has prompted warnings from scientists and climate activists about the accelerating dangers of failing to move rapidly toward clean energy and more sustainable development. \"The science on climate change is unforgiving, with every year of delay locking in more costs and more irreversible changes,\" said Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.",
      "Climate advocates say four more years of Trump policies will mean the most robust action to fight climate change will need to be pursued at the state and local level, as well as by the business sector.",
      "Putting vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of health care",
      "Kennedy's name has been floated to oversee a variety of health-related issues in a second Trump administration, including to run the Department of Health and Human Services. It's unclear, though, whether a nomination to a Cabinet position would receive the necessary support from Senate Republicans.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told CNN that the Senate will \"give great deference to a president that just won a stunning, what I think is an Electoral College landslide when all is said is done and a mandate.\"",
      "\"He's being given a mandate to govern, and I think presidents who are given a mandate to govern deserve from the Senate the opportunity to surround themselves with people who are going to execute their policies,\" Rubio said.",
      "Kennedy has spent years promoting false information and fears about vaccines, baselessly linking vaccines to autism long after such claims were disproven. He also falsely claimed COVID-19 was \"ethnically targeted\" to attack certain ethnic groups while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people \u2014 a conspiracy theory that drew accusations of antisemitism and racism. Kennedy also claimed Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water, a pet project of Kennedy's.",
      "Kennedy has said recently that he doesn't want to take vaccine options away from Americans, but his skepticism of them and conspiracy-laden views on science and medicine alarm public health experts.",
      "Kennedy has also campaigned against pesticide use in agriculture and processed food additives.",
      "During a rally in Henderson, Nevada, Trump suggested Kennedy would \"work on health and women's health,\" and said on election night that Kennedy is \"going to go make America healthy again.\"",
      "In an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson last week, Trump said Kennedy \"can do whatever he wants,\" adding that he'd like the one-time independent presidential candidate to look at pesticides and vaccines.",
      "\"I want you to take care of the women of this country, the men of this country and the children of this country,\" he said.",
      "When NBC News recently asked Trump if \"banning certain vaccines\" might be on the table, Trump didn't dismiss the idea outright, saying he would make a decision and referred to Kennedy as a talented man with \"strong views.\"",
      "Cutting taxes and business regulations",
      "Trump has said he would boost economic growth through a combination of cutting taxes and eliminating regulations on business. Specifically, he is expected to push Congress to extend the sweeping tax cuts enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Trump has also proposed lowering corporate taxes to 15% from their current level of 21%; reversing a $10,000 deduction cap on state and local property taxes; ending taxes on tipped wages and overtime pay; and eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "If Congress extends the TCJA cuts, income taxes would decline under Trump for Americans of all incomes, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "Overall, Trump's tax cuts would lower federal revenue by $5.8 trillion over the next 10 years, adding to the nation's mounting debt, Penn Wharton estimates. The national debt has grown significantly under both Trump and Mr. Biden in the last eight years.",
      "On the regulatory front, Trump has pledged to remove federal restrictions on fossil fuel production, eliminate red tape in housing construction and ease rules on cryptocurrencies, among other efforts. Investors expect such moves to drive up corporate profits and, in turn, stock prices.",
      "Imposing massive tariff hikes",
      "Trump has said he wants to impose tariffs on all international imports, which economists generally believe will lead to an increase in the price of goods.",
      "Trump pledged to impose 10% across-the-board levies on all products imported to the U.S. from overseas, something he says will protect American jobs and raise more federal revenue, which suggests that he believes that high tariffs would force companies to bring production back to the U.S., creating American jobs, and therefore more taxable revenue.",
      "But most economists say that would likely backfire. Manufacturers would pass costs on to consumers, effectively creating\u00a0 a new tax on Americans. Trump also proposed a levy of 60% or more on Chinese imports \u2014 so, in total, if these tariffs were enacted, a typical middle-class household\u00a0 would face an estimated $1,700 a year in additional costs, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Rolling back protections for LGBTQ+ people",
      "Trump has been inconsistent on questions surrounding LGBTQ rights, but during his first term, he rolled back protections for LGBTQ people \u2014 especially transgender individuals \u2014 and anti-trans rhetoric became a theme of his 2024 campaign. His campaign spent tens of millions on one such high-visibility ad that ran during the World Series, NFL and college football games with the memorable tagline \"\"Kamala is for they/them. Trump is for you.\"",
      "The Trump administration reversed a policy that required schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. His administration banned some transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 a policy that Mr. Biden reversed. And he also tried to repeal health protections for transgender people and sought to end protections for transgender individuals in federal prison, among other policies.",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to use his second term to punish doctors who provide gender affirming care for minors and impose consequences for teachers who discuss it with their minor students.",
      "Leaving abortion access to be decided by states",
      "The president-elect's stances on abortion\u00a0have been contradictory in the years since he began running for the presidency. He's touted the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, taking credit for appointing three of the justices who joined the majority ruling.",
      "He frequently says the issue should be left up to the states \u2014 some of which have imposed near-total abortion bans. Trump has also pledged not to sign a national abortion ban.",
      "\"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,\" Trump said in April.",
      "At the presidential debate with Harris, Trump said, \"I'm not signing a ban,\" adding that there's \"no reason to sign a ban because we've gotten what everybody wanted.\" In October, he went further, saying he'd veto a national abortion ban.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have called for further restrictions on abortion through a law already on the books. They believe the Comstock Act, which concerns the the shipping of materials deemed as \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile,\" could be applied to ban anything used to aid an abortion \u2014 not just the mailing of abortion pills. Trump told CBS News in August that he would not enforce the Comstock Act.",
      "On IVF, another reproductive rights issue that has come to the fore in recent months, Trump has pledged to expand access to the expensive fertility treatments. The pledge came in response to backlash following a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that determined that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children, raising the possibility of infanticide prosecutions if they're destroyed. This prompted clinics in the state to temporarily halt treatments. Democrats have warned that Republicans want to restrict access to the procedures, while blaming the Alabama ruling and threats to fertility treatments in other states on Trump.",
      "Trump announced last month a new plan that would require the federal government to pay for the fertility treatments or require insurance companies to cover costs associated with IVF. He has not said how the government would pay for the high cost of IVF, and the idea of an insurance mandate for IVF treatments runs counter to one of the main pursuits of his first term, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. He did succeed in killing the law's individual mandate through the enactment of his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Changing U.S. policy on Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the first foreign leaders to hail Trump's victory.",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said in a tweet even before Trump's election win was confirmed.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to Trump in a \"warm and cordial\" phone call, his spokesperson said, adding that the two men \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Trump has not said how he'll address Israel's still-expanding wars against Iran-backed Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but he's suggested he can end the conflagration in the heart of the Middle East quickly.",
      "Netanyahu, under intense domestic and international pressure over his handling of the multi-front war, has relied heavily on Washington, Israel's closest ally, for military and diplomatic backing to continue the fight. He will be urging Trump to keep that vital support coming amid intense international pressure over the humanitarian crises in Gaza and Lebanon, and growing domestic pressure over his handling of the war.",
      "But veteran Israeli diplomat, government adviser and now journalist Alon Pinkas told CBS News ahead of the U.S. election that in his view, Trump is a \"very transactional man\" who fails to understand the complexities of the wars Israel is fighting and the motivation behind them.",
      "\"He's war averse,\" Pinkas said of Trump, adding that the president-elect's isolationist tendencies presented \"a great risk\" for Israel.",
      "Even if Trump were to decide to back away from active support for Israel and essentially let Netanyahu do as he sees fit, without criticism or threats of suspending aid, Pinkas said that wouldn't be enough to ensure Israel's security.",
      "\"If you look at the last six months, about American involvement in intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles in April, in deploying a THAAD missile system in Israel just three weeks ago, in deterring Iran to the best of their ability and providing Israel hardware and munitions that otherwise Israel may not have received,\" said Pinkas, \"it's not enough that they write, the Congress\u2026a blank check of $3.8 billion, which is the annual military aid, and say, 'leave us alone, do with it what you want.' There needs to be active American diplomacy.\"",
      "Pressuring Ukraine to cede ground to Russia to end war",
      "Trump will take over as the U.S. commander-in-chief amid the deadliest conflict on the European continent since World War II. He's said he can end the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine before he even takes office.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had an \"excellent\" conversation with Trump after the election, adding that they had agreed to \"advance\" cooperation.",
      "But on the campaign trail, Trump never said how he would end the war, and Ukrainians have voiced fear for months that he could do so by curbing the U.S. military and financial support \u2014 already worth more than $50 billion \u2014 which has been a lifeline for the country's defense, and force Zelenskyy to meet Russia's demands to cede occupied territory.",
      "Any fresh attempt to end violence like this is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has said repeatedly that the war will not end until the areas his forces have unilaterally and illegally annexed \u2014 around a fifth of Ukraine's territory \u2014 are recognized as part of Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy insists that all of Ukraine's land must be returned, and he's warned repeatedly that allowing Putin to seize ground will embolden the Russian leader, with direct implications for America.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News early this year.",
      "Heaping pressure on NATO allies to cough up more cash",
      "There is clear precedent for Trump's stance on the U.S.-led NATO alliance that was born out of the military partnerships formed during World War II. During his first term and since, Trump has made it clear that he feels America's European NATO allies slipped into complacency, relying on their superpower partner for theoretical defense in what had been decades of peacetime.",
      "He demanded publicly, repeatedly that some of America's oldest and closest allies meet their NATO membership commitment to devote at least 2% of their annual GDP to their defense budgets. Trump accused some allies of freeloading - benefitting from the guarantee of NATO's collective defense principle without paying their fair share.",
      "While the European jitters over the Ukraine war are undoubtedly a factor, his reprimands seem to have worked, to some degree. The majority of NATO member states now meet at least the 2% threshold. It's little wonder, perhaps, that the only two countries that devote more than the U.S. to defense, proportionally, are Poland, which borders Ukraine, and Estonia, which borders Russia.",
      "There are still wider concerns, meanwhile, among NATO partners over the level of Trump's commitment to the alliance, and he vowed on the campaign trail to \"fundamentally reevaluate NATO's purpose and mission.\"",

    "summary": "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy promoted family unity among mixed-status households.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration program that would allow unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens to get legal status and a streamlined path to U.S. citizenship, declaring the policy illegal.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge J. Campbell Barker, an appointee of President-elect Donald Trump, found the program violates U.S. immigration law, agreeing with a lawsuit filed by Texas and more than a dozen other Republican-led states.",
      "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy, known as Keeping Families Together, promoted family unity among mixed-status households. When it was announced earlier this year, officials said roughly half-a-million undocumented immigrants were likely eligible for the program.",
      "The Justice Department can appeal Thursday's ruling, but the Keeping Families Together program is likely to be in the crosshairs of the incoming administration of Trump, who has vowed to dismantle President Biden's immigration policies. Trump has separately promised to seal and militarize the U.S.-Mexico border and oversee the largest mass deportation in American history.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with yesterday's ruling and we are evaluating next steps,\" White House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez said in a statement Friday. \"This ruling sides with Republican state officials who are seeking to force U.S. citizens and their families, people who have lived in the United States for more than ten years, to either separate or live in the shadows in constant fear of deportation. As the President has said, America is not a country that tears families apart.\"",
      "The Keeping Families Together initiative was announced by Mr. Biden in June, just weeks after he took a different executive action to sharply limit asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The program would give work permits and deportation protections to undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens and have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes.",
      "Most importantly, the policy would also allow these immigrants to apply for permanent residency, also known as a green card. After three years, green card holders married to U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship.",
      "Immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are already eligible for a green card on paper. American immigration law, however, requires those who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. But leaving the U.S. after living in the country unlawfully for some time can trigger a 3 or 10-year exile, prompting many families to refrain from pursuing that option.",
      "The Biden administration's program would allow eligible immigrants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country by granting them an immigration benefit known as parole, which effectively cancels out their illegal entry.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",

      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",

      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",

      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",

      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",

    "summary": "An Iranian operative told investigators that he was tasked in September with assassinating Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
    "story": [
      "An operative working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told federal investigators that he was tasked in September with \"surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating\" President-elect Donald Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
      "Prosecutors say Farhad Shakeri, who is believed to be residing in Iran, told investigators in a phone interview that unnamed IRGC officials pushed him to plan an attack against Trump last month. If the plan could not come together in time, the Iranian officials directed Shakeri to delay the plot until after the presidential election because the official \"assessed that [Trump] would lose the election,\" charging documents revealed.",
      "Shakeri and two individuals living in the U.S. \u2014 Carlisle Rivera of Brooklyn, New York; and Jonathon Loadholt of Staten Island \u2014 were charged as part of a broad Iran-backed scheme to allegedly surveille and ultimately assassinate individuals inside the U.S. who opposed the Iranian regime.",
      "FBI investigators wrote that Shakeri immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Iran, but was deported in 2008 after serving more than a decade in prison on robbery charges. They alleged the IRGC ultimately used Shakeri to recruit criminal contacts inside the U.S. to carry out specific operations like targeting an unnamed Iranian American journalist and activist living in New York.",
      "In February, prosecutors alleged Shakeri paid Rivera and Loadholt about $1,000 to monitor the activist \u2014 who has spoken out against Iran's regime \u2014 at an event at Fairfield University in Connecticut. The surveillance operations continued into March, according to court documents, when the pair allegedly traveled multiple times to the activist's Brooklyn home. Text messages, security camera footage and cell site location data revealed their numerous trips.",
      "\"On or about April 1, 2024, 9 SHAKERI and RIVERA exchanged voice notes discussing RIVERA and LOADHOLT' s efforts to locate and murder\" the Iranian American, court records said.",
      "\"This b**** is hard to catch, bro,\" Rivera allegedly said to Shakeri. \"There ain't gonna be no simple pull up, unless there['s] the luck of the draw.\"",
      "According to court records, Shakeri allegedly responded later, \"you just gotta have patience and don't, kicking, kick in the door is not an option because that's a fail, that's a fail maneuver. You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it. Don't think about going in. In is a suicide move.\"",
      "Investigators searched online accounts belonging to Rivera and Loadholt in the course of the federal probe and uncovered numerous images of firearms and other weapons.",
      "In April, Shakeri agreed to pay Rivera and Loadholt $100,000 to \"finish the work\" and said he was tasked by the IRGC to hire individuals to assassinate the journalist. And by July, according to charging documents, the Iranians were growing impatient, instructing their U.S. assets to \"take care of it already.\"",
      "The alleged plot to kill the activist did not succeed.",
      "Rivera and Loadholt are not accused of being part of the plot to target Trump. They made their initial appearance in federal court on Thursday and were ordered detained, according to the Justice Department. Shakeri remains at large.",
      "\"We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.",
      "The charges announced Friday are not the first brought against alleged operatives of the IRGC for plotting to kill Trump. Earlier this year, the FBI arrested Asif Merchant for planning to assassinate U.S. government officials, including potentially the president-elect. Merchant remains in custody and pleaded not guilty.",
      "On at least five occasions between September and November, Shakeri participated in \"voluntary telephonic interviews with FBI agents\" in exchange for a sentence reduction for another individual serving time in the U.S, court records said.",
      "During the interviews, he allegedly told the FBI of the IRGC's desire to kill the Iranian American activist and target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka with a mass shooting event. Shakeri also told investigators that the IRGC tasked him with surveilling two Jewish American citizens living in New York, but he did not provide the Iranian officials with information about the unnamed targets.",
      "During the interview, Shakeri also allegedly told the FBI about the effort to target Trump.",
      "In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, \"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 a designated foreign terrorist organization \u2014 has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply won't be tolerated.\"",
      "The charges and allegations announced Friday are part of broader posture by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement to publicly bring attention to Iran's alleged efforts to quiet dissidents on U.S. soil and target U.S. government figures after the killing of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani by American forces in 2020. Trump and former members of his administration have been forced in recent years to increase his security due to the threats.",

      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn is holding off on enforcing his ruling for 30 days to allow Illinois leaders time to appeal.",
    "story": [
      "CHICAGO (CBS) --\u00a0A federal judge in downstate Illinois has ruled the state's ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional, but will hold off on prohibiting the state from enforcing it for one month to allow for a likely appeal.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn, who sits on the federal court in East Saint Louis, wrote in his 168-page opinion that the statewide ban on assault-style weapons violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The Protect Illinois Communities Act\u00a0bans the sale of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requires existing owners of those weapons to register them with Illinois State Police.",
      "The legislation, signed into law in January 2023, banned dozens of specific brands or types of rifles and handguns, .50-caliber guns, attachments and rapid-firing devices. No rifle will be allowed to accommodate more than 10 rounds, with a 15-round limit for handguns.",
      "As part of his ruling that the assault weapons ban is unconstitutional, McGlynn issued a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ban, but he stayed that injunction for 30 days to give the state time to file an appeal.",
      "Gun control laws have come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the\u00a0Supreme Court's June 2022 decision\u00a0that imposed a new framework for evaluating the constitutionality of gun restrictions. In that ruling, the court said that for firearms laws to comply with the Second Amendment, the government must identify historical analogues that show the measure is consistent with the nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "McGlynn sided with plaintiffs who argued the Illinois assault weapons ban does not fit within the Supreme Court's framework, and who argued that assault weapons are commonly used for self-defense.",
      "\"What is particularly disturbing is that the prohibition of weapons that are commonly owned and used by citizens are now banned, depriving citizens of a principal means to defend themselves and their property in situations where a handgun or shotgun alone would not be the citizen's preferred arm,\" McGlynn wrote. \"Sadly, there are those who seek to usher in a sort of post-Constitution era where the citizens' individual rights are only as important as they are convenient to a ruling class.\"",
      "McGlynn compared the use of firearms for self-defense to equipping vehicles with airbags, ocean liners with lifeboats, or houses with storm shelters.",
      "\"Why do we protect ourselves with firearms? In life, we face many perils,\" He wrote. \"Too often, the perils we face are forced upon us by other people. By people who are negligent, reckless, insane, impaired, or evil. Sometimes it is the proverbial lone wolf; sometimes, it is the whole wolf pack. Truly, life comes at you quickly. And who comes to our aid in times of peril? Sometimes, it is the police or first responders; other times it is healthcare professionals; and sometimes it is family, friends, or neighbors. Sometimes, it is no one.\"",
      "Before the case went to trial earlier this year, McGlynn issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Illinois from enforcing the assault weapons ban, but a federal appeals court later reversed that decision. In July, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case, sending it back to McGlynn for a trial, which was held in September.",
      "Meanwhile, a case against an assault weapons ban in Maryland has been upped to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court takes the Maryland case, it could take the Illinois case\u2014or send it back to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Two similar lawsuits are pending in federal court in Chicago.",
      "Gun rights and gun control advocates react",
      "Dan Eldridge was one of the plaintiffs who argued that assault-style weapons banned under Illinois law are commonly used for self-defense purposes.",
      "\"Illinois does not want to be the test case that shows all of these state so-called assault weapon bans are unconstitutional,\" said Dan Eldridge, president of Firearm Licensees of Illinois.",
      "Eldridge said the judge simply decided the Illinois law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\"This trial was on the merits of the case, and he found in our favor, and found that PICA's 'assault weapon' ban is unconstitutional under the 2nd and 14th amendments,\" he said.",
      "Rachel Jacoby of Highland Park was in Springfield on Jan. 10, 2023\u2014the day Gov. JB Pritzker signed the ban int law\u2014representing her community. It was July 4, 2022, when a man with a high-powered rifle opened fire on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park and killed seven people.",
      "\"This ruling is a slap in the face to every single person in Illinois who's been affected by gun violence, because those of us who have been personally affected by gun violence know the pain and trauma that comes from experiencing this,\" Jacoby said, \"and this judge's ruling is callous and unfounded in my opinion.\"",
      "Although the State of Illinois has already appealed the ruling, Eldridge said he hopes the plaintiffs are fortunate enough to win.",
      "\"And everything goes back to how it was on January 9 of 2023,\" Eldridge said.",
      "Jacoby hopes the ban stays in place, because regular people should not be able to access assault-style weapons.",
      "\"We know firsthand the devastation and trauma that these assault weapons can cause our communities, and we want to make sure that no other community has to experience that pain, that carnage, and that horror that we experienced,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said:",
      "\"The Protect Illinois Communities Act was the result of hundreds of hours of deliberation between legal experts, legislators, and advocates, and it makes Illinois a safer place for everyone. Despite those who value weapons of war more than public safety, this law was enacted to and has protected Illinoisans from the constant fear of being gunned down in places where they ought to feel secure. We look forward to the Attorney General filing an immediate appeal and the Governor is confident the constitutionality of the Protect Illinois Communities Act will be upheld through this process.\"",

    "story": [
      "While the 2024 presidential election was among the closest in recent memory \u2014 with President-elect Donald Trump ahead by about 3 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 Trump's vote share grew in a diverse array of regions across the country and across different demographic groups.",
      "It's the first time in Trump's three campaigns for the White House that he's topped his opponent in the popular vote, and only the second time since 1988 that any Republican has done so. In 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won almost 66 million votes (48%), compared to Trump's nearly 63 million (46%), but Trump won the Electoral College. In 2020, he lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote to President Biden, who received about 81 million votes (51%) nationwide, compared to Trump's 74 million (47%).",
      "Trump's victory in 2024 was driven by improvements in support in a vast majority of counties nationwide \u2014 more than 9 in 10 \u2014 according to data from counties where at least 95% of votes have been counted as of Friday. Trump's improvements crossed regions, and included urban, suburban and rural gains.",
      "Trump even fared better in most places where a majority of voters preferred Harris, like New Jersey, or across the Hudson River, in his hometown of New York City.",
      "The Garden State, a longtime Democratic stronghold, swung markedly in Trump's favor. For instance, the latest data show Trump with a slim 3% lead in suburban Passaic County, where he got just 41% of the vote in 2020.",
      "In New York City, where Trump grew up and spent most of his life before entering politics, he didn't just surpass his two previous results; his roughly 30% vote share topped every Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan, 40 years ago.",
      "Nearly 2,000 miles away, Maverick County, Texas, a majority Latino border county that Biden carried easily in 2020, swung even more, about 28 points. Trump in 2024 outperformed Biden's 2020 showing, and Harris fared worse than Trump did in 2020.",
      "CBS News exit polls from the last two elections showed Trump gaining among both men and women this year. In 2020, Trump won men by a hair, 49% to 48%, but in 2024, his campaign's efforts to woo men appear to have paid off: his support from men grew to 55%.",
      "In 2020, Trump managed to win 43% of women voters. In 2024, despite Democrats' focus on women voters and abortion access, which boosted them in the midterm election races, Trump still increased his numbers with women, notching up that figure two ticks, to 45%.",
      "Trump made gains among core groups within the traditional Republican coalition, such as evangelical voters. But he also increased his support among groups Democrats have relied on, including young voters and Latino voters, such as those in Maverick County and another former Democratic stronghold, Florida's Miami-Dade, which Mr. Biden won in 2020, with 53%. This year, Trump carried the county with about 55% of the vote, becoming the first Republican to win there since 1988.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's victory Tuesday has stirred up whispers about whether Justice Sonia Sotomayor should step down from the Supreme Court to allow President Biden to nominate a successor before Republicans take control of Washington.",
      "But any changes in the composition of the nation's highest court are unlikely in the coming months, even as lawmakers return for a lame-duck session to finish their business before Trump is sworn in for a second term and the GOP assumes the Senate majority.",
      "Sotomayor hasn't responded publicly to the chatter about a retirement, and she did not return a request for comment about her future. She remains an active questioner during oral arguments and has become known for biting dissents in hotly contested cases.",
      "At 70, she is not the oldest member of the Supreme Court \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas is 76 and Justice Samuel Alito is 74 \u2014 and she is newly into her tenure as the senior-most member of its liberal wing, a position she assumed following the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer in 2022.",
      "Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice, is also a decade younger than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was when she faced pressure to step down from the Supreme Court in 2013 and 2014.",
      "Ginsburg, who was treated for early-stage colon cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009, rejected any suggestion that she retire to allow then-President Barack Obama to name a successor while Democrats had control of the Senate. She remained on the Supreme Court until her death in September 2020, after which Trump, nearing the end of his first term, selected Justice Amy Coney Barrett to fill her seat. Barrett's confirmation by the GOP-led Senate widened the Supreme Court's conservative majority to 6-3.",
      "With a second term for Trump on the horizon, and Democrats losing control of the Senate come January, when Republicans will hold at least 52 seats, progressives are fearful of a repeat of what happened with Ginsburg's seat.",
      "\"We have no idea how long it will be until somebody who shares Justice Sotomayor's jurisprudence, her values will be in a position to be nominated again,\" Molly Coleman, executive director of the People's Parity Project, a progressive judicial group, told CBS News. \"Of course we all want to hope for the best, but unfortunately we've been left in a position where that's all we can do.\"",
      "The circumstances of more than a decade ago are different from today, making it far from a sure thing that even if Sotomayor were to retire, the Senate would confirm her replacement before the GOP takes over. For one, Democrats currently have a narrow 51-49 majority, which includes the four independent senators who vote with the party.",
      "One of those senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, told Politico in March that he would not support nominees who do not have GOP support.",
      "\"Just one Republican. That's all I'm asking for. Give me something bipartisan. This is my own little filibuster. If they can't get one Republican, I vote for none. I've told [Democrats] that. I said, 'I'm sick and tired of it, I can't take it anymore,'\" Manchin, who is retiring from the Senate, said.",
      "He later appeared to slightly reverse course, voting in September to advance the nomination of a candidate for a federal appeals court. A spokesperson for the senator told Axios at the time that Manchin learned opposition to the nominee was based on how the White House handled the process, not qualifications.",
      "Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California Berkeley Law School, said there is not enough time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed by the Senate by early January. Incoming House and Senate members will be sworn in on Jan. 3, and the results of the election will be reaffirmed by Congress on Jan. 6.",
      "\"Joe Manchin made clear he would not vote for any nominee without Republican support and no Republican would vote for a Biden nominee to replace Sotomayor. Sotomayor retiring now would likely just give Trump a vacancy to fill. It is totally different from whether Ginsburg should have retired in summer 2014 before the election,\" he told CBS News in an email.",
      "Chemerinsky wrote in September 2014 that Ginsburg should have retired that summer and warned her decision not to \"could end up hurting her legal legacy.\" Democrats had control of the Senate at that time, but lost it following the November 2014 midterm elections.",
      "Even some progressive groups that called for open discussions about Sotomayor's future on the court months ago are recognizing that the window has closed.",
      "\"The reality is it's too late. It's too late for Democrats to be having this conversation. It's too late to be launching a pressure campaign. The ship has sailed,\" Coleman, of the People's Parity Project said.",
      "She said discussions should have happened earlier this year and warned the consequences of waiting may be \"catastrophic.\"",
      "Instead, liberal judicial advocacy groups are turning their focus to the confirming Mr. Biden's remaining nominees to the federal district and appeals courts. There are currently 47 open seats on the federal bench, and 17 nominees are awaiting Senate action. There will be another 20 vacancies in the coming weeks, and 11 nominees are pending for those seats.",
      "\"Hand wringing about the unknown doesn't help anyone right now,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of the judicial group Demand Justice. \"Right now, we are firmly focused on the fact that there are still 30 pending Biden nominees before the Senate that deserve, and need, confirmation. The Senate should be focused on working late, working weekends to get these talented individuals on the bench.\"",
      "Trump saw immense success with judicial confirmations during his first term, appointing 234 jurists to the Supreme Court, federal courts of appeals, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. But Mr. Biden is closing in on that number, with 213 appointments so far.",

      "When asked if he'd step down if Trump requested it, Powell responded with a one-word answer: \"No.\"",
      "Powell's insistence that he'll remain in his role comes after Trump aired grievances about the Fed's decision-making during his first presidency and, more recently, on the campaign trial. Trump, who has accused Powell of being \"political,\" also told Bloomberg Businessweek this summer he would let the economist serve out his term, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Yet Trump has also said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\"\u00a0Trump\u00a0said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",
      "Fed Chair Powell's term",
      "Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",

      "\"I'm not going to get into the political things here today,\" Powell said in response to a question from CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "Powell also noted that the election in the near-term will have no impact on the central bank's rate decisions, with the Fed instead relying on economic data for its decisions. For now, he added, it's not clear what policies or tax changes may emerge from a second Trump presidency.",
      "Many of Trump's proposals, such as tax cuts, must be passed by Congress before being signed into law by the president.",
      "\"We don't know what the timing or substance of any policy changes will be,\" Powell said. \"We don't guess, we don't speculate and we don't assume.\"",

He owes the women, Ruby Freeman and daughter Wandrea Moss, millions in damages.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman, upon being informed that Giuliani is the only person named on a list of people who have knowledge of Giuliani's assets \u2014 and that he wants his name removed \u2014 called the request \"farcical.\"",

      "Hearings in the matter were being conducted remotely, but Liman ordered Giuliani to appear Thursday in person after learning that Giuliani had not met his obligations to the two women. Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea Moss, said they went to Giuliani's Manhattan apartment last week and discovered that it had been emptied out, frustrating their efforts to catalog and obtain his assets.",

The women are also entitled to some $2 million that Giuliani has said President-elect Trump's 2020 campaign owes him.",
      "In another tense moment, Caruso called it \"vindictive\" that Giuliani must turn over a watch that's an heirloom previously owned by his grandfather. Liman raised his voice, saying \"Oh, come on,\" before pointing to other cases he hears regularly, such as people \"who run bodegas and short their employees' wages.\"",
      "\"If they have a debt, they have to pay the debt. It doesn't matter if it's an heirloom.\" Liman said. He later said Moss and Freeman had been willing to let Giuliani keep the watch, but he never filed paperwork asking to do so.",
      "Giuliani was in the passenger's seat of a Mercedes convertible that appeared to be the 1980 classic once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall when he arrived to vote in Florida on Tuesday.",
      "Later that day, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor and disbarred ex-attorney for Trump seemed to confirm it was the same vehicle, and said they've attempted to turn it over.",

Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v.

      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",
      "What impact has the 4B movement had in South Korea?",
      "The 4B movement has been controversial in South Korea. The country's president Yoon Suk-yeol said in 2021 that feminist movements were \"blocking healthy relationships\" between men and women in the nation.",

      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

    "summary": "Medical issues aside, the astronauts described a water leak in June that triggered a blizzard in the International Space Station's airlock.",
    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

      "An unpiloted SpaceX Dragon cargo ship caught up with the International Space Station and glided in for a smooth docking on Tuesday \u2014\u00a0Election Day\u00a0across the U.S. \u2014 bringing 3 tons of supplies, science gear and other equipment to the lab, including holiday treats for the crew.",
      "The Dragon's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:29 p.m. EST Monday, lighting up the night sky for miles around as it climbed away atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.",
      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",
      "The landing marked SpaceX's 57th successful booster recovery at the Florida Space Force station and its 363rd overall, including California flights and droneship landings.",
      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own.",
      "Running slightly ahead of schedule, the cargo ship executed a series of rendezvous rocket firings, catching up with the space station from behind and below before looping up to docking at the lab's forward port at 9:52 a.m.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Dragon,\" astronaut Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore radioed from inside the station. \"Nice to  have you aboard.\" Station commander Sunita Williams, referring to the  successful docking in general and the food on board in particular,  added: \"Just want to say thank you to SpaceX, the International Space  Station program, the Commercial Crew program for bringing us... honey.\"",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",
      "One of the more unusual payloads: Lignosat, a small wooden satellite using a framework of magnolia panels built by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan and the Tokyo-based logging company Sumitomo.",
      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",
      "As with all station-bound Dragon cargo ships, the crew supplies include fresh food and special treats for holiday meals.",
      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",
      "And in an experiment that could be particularly useful to future astronauts, a small device known as Nanolab Astrobeat, provided by the Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology, will test cold welding technology that could prove useful for repairing leaks or other damage from inside a spacecraft.",

    "summary": "As votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle.",
    "story": [
      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",

      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",

      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Correct. Uh, so, that's what they did. \u2026 They surveilled his house \u2026 and then went and snatched a bag of trash \u2026 and sent it to me.",

      "How Alcala reacted to Christine's photograph was something the detectives will never forget.",
      "Daniel Errasmouspe: And it almost clicked [snaps fingers] like that with him, and you could almost tell that he was reliving that day.",
      "Det. Jeff Sheaman: Eventually he took the photograph, set it on his lap and he used his index finger and just started tracing her body. Tracing her body for probably five minutes. And eventually he set the paper down flat and he started tapping \u2014   tapping on the photograph of Christine. Right over Christine's body tapping the photograph. \u00a0And eventually the tapping got louder, it got louder, he eventually looked at me, and at that point I honestly thought he would provide us more information about Christine.",
      "But it was a game. Despite his age, his infirmity, his close to 40 years behind bars \u2014   Alcala was still the master manipulator he'd always been.",
      "Daniel Errasmouspe: He was very even-keel[ed]. Very. The only time he would show any type of a fervor in his voice would be when we point-blank ask him, \"Did you kill her?\" And he would say, \"No, no. You're crazy. You're stupid\u2026\"\u00a0 And then when I asked him, \"Was she alive when you left her?\" And he said, \"yes.\"\u2026 \"She was alive when I left.\"",
      "That's all the prosecutor really needed to hear.",
      "Daniel Errasmouspe: The fact he admitted he was there just cinched it for me. He could deny killing her all he wants. But the fact that he admitted, as far as I'm concerned, is a confession \u2026 I decided to charge him with first-degree murder.",
      "There would be no extradition to Wyoming.",

    "story": [
      "Bobby Allison, founder of racing's \"Alabama Gang\" and a NASCAR Hall of Famer, died Saturday. He was 86.",
      "NASCAR released a statement from Allison's family that said he died at home in Mooresville, North Carolina. A cause of death wasn't given, but Allison had been in declining health for years.",
      "Allison moved to fourth on NASCAR's Cup Series victory list last month when chairman Jim France recognized him as the winner of the Meyers Brothers Memorial at Bowman Gray Stadium in North Carolina in 1971. The sanctioning body updated its record books to reflect the decision, giving Allison 85 wins and moving him out of a tie with Darrell Waltrip.",
      "France and longtime NASCAR executive Mike Helton presented Allison with a plaque commemorating the victory. With it, Allison trails only fellow Hall of Famers Richard Petty (200), David Pearson (105) and Jeff Gordon (93) in Cup wins.",
      "Allison was inducted into NASCAR's second Hall of Fame class, in 2011. He was the 1983 NASCAR champion, finished second in the series title race five times, and a three-time winner of the Daytona 500.",
      "\"Bobby was the ultimate fan's driver,\" Allison's family said in a statement. \"He thoroughly enjoyed spending time with his fans and would stop to sign autographs and have conversations with them everywhere he went. He was a dedicated family man and friend, and a devout Catholic.\"",
      "He helped put NASCAR on the map with more than his driving. His infamous fight with Cale Yarborough in the closing laps of the 1979 Daytona 500 served as one of the sport's defining moments.",
      "\"Cale went to beating on my fist with his nose,\" Allison has said repeatedly, often using that phrase to describe the fight. \"Cale understands like I do that it really was a benefit to the interest of racing. It proves that we were sincere.\"",
      "Born in Miami in 1937, Allison started searching for more racing opportunities outside the Sunshine State. He landed in central Alabama, where he found a number of small, dirt tracks.",
      "He returned to Florida to get brother Donnie and close friend Red Farmer. They set up shop in Hueytown, Alabama, and dominated regional races throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. They were later joined in the Alabama Gang by Jimmy Mears, Neil Bonnett and Bonnett and Allison's sons Davey and Clifford.",
      "Allison retired in 1988 following a crash that nearly killed him. In June 1987, he wrecked on the opening lap at Talledega Superspeedway. He hit the outside wall and then got T-boned in the driver's side door. He was initially declared dead upon reaching a local hospital but was later resuscitated.",
      "He eventually regained his memory, re-learned everyday activities and attempted a comeback. But a series of tragedies led Allison to retire. His son, Clifford, was fatally injured during a crash in practice for the second-tier Busch Series at Michigan International Speedway in 1992. A year later, son Davey was killed in a helicopter crash at Talladega.",
      "Three years after that, Bobby and wife Judy divorced. They reconnected four years later at their daughter-in-law's wedding and were remarried in 2000. They remained together until Judy's death in 2015.",
      "Allison was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1992 and into the NASCAR Hall of Fame along with Ned Jarrett, Bud Moore, Pearson and Lee Petty.",
      "\"Bobby Allison personified the term 'racer,'\" France said in statement. \"Though he is best known as one of the winningest drivers in NASCAR Cup Series history, his impact on the sport extends far beyond the record books.",
      "Allison is one of 10 drivers to have won NASCAR's career \"grand slam\" that includes the Cup Series' most iconic races: the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, the Coca-Cola 600 and the Southern 500.",

But in Cleveland's hometown, locals still want to preserve his legacy.",

      "Based on the evidence presented at trial, Ubaldo accepted cash from so-called \"marketers\" in return for sending patients' blood and urine samples to particular labs, which then billed insurance companies and Medicare for running diagnostic tests, according to a news release\u00a0from the U.S. Attorney's Office.",
      "Ubaldo also entered into \"sham medical advisory agreements with the labs and marketers\" where he was supposed to provide advisory services in exchange for a monthly fee. However, the labs and marketers did not need these services, and Ubaldo did not provide them.",
      "\"Instead, the medical advisory service agreements served as a fraudulent vehicle to funnel kickback payments to Dr. Ubaldo in exchange for his sending samples to specific labs,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.",
      "On various occasions, one of the marketers met with Ubaldo at his office and handed over thousands of dollars in cash. Video evidence of the meetings was introduced in court.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I need the cash,\" Dr. Ubaldo told the marketer at one of the meetings.",
      "Ubaldo accepted more than $253,000 in bribes, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. He now faces up to 15 years in federal prison and was taken into custody as he awaits sentencing.",

    "summary": "Republicans' newly won control of the Senate may have buoyed Kennedy's odds of a role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",
      "\"Make no mistake, what is being discussed is a major reimagining of the entire federal health research and promotion and protection infrastructure. That includes very significant reforms and changes in business practice,\" said Malone.",

    "summary": "In Brazil\u00b4s Amazonas state, almost 6,000 riverine dwellers authorized to fish have reported a significant drop in production and rising costs.",
    "story": [
      "Two years of record-breaking drought have dealt a heavy blow to what is arguably the Amazon's most successful sustainable economy: the managed fishery for the giant pirarucu.",
      "In Brazil\u00b4s Amazonas state, almost 6,000 riverine dwellers authorized to fish have reported a sharp drop in production and rising costs. They are demanding aid from the federal government and debating how to adapt to climate change.",
      "Last year's catch totaled 70% of the government-authorized quota of 100,443 fish. This year could see an even steeper decline, since many communities still haven\u00b4t been able to fish. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.",
      "Pirarucu managed fishing began in the Amazon 25 years ago in the Mamiraua region and has since expanded. It helped the Amazon's largest fish escape risk of extinction and is now an important source of income for locals in 10 sustainable conservation units and eight Indigenous territories, where deforestation is close to zero.",
      "Unlike other aquatic species of the Amazon, such as river dolphins, the pirarucu \u2014 also known as arapaima \u2014 historically have proven resilient to drought and climate change. But low water levels are making it extremely difficult for fishers to transport their catch from remote lakes to major rivers and onto cities.",
      "It's a mammoth task. The pirarucu, which can weigh up to 200 kilograms (440 pounds), lives in large lakes that during flood season are often connected to major rivers. Fishing typically occurs when water levels begin to recede, making it easier to trap the fish and transport them out in small boats or canoes. In several areas, however, water levels dropped so quickly that this connection was cut off before fishing could begin.",
      "In the S\u00e3o Raimundo community in the Medio Jurua region, fishing is scheduled to start Saturday, a two-month delay \u2014 a common situation this season. As a result, Coletivo Pirarucu, an umbrella organization that represents 2,500 riverine and Indigenous families, has requested that the federal government extend fishing season until the end of January.",
      "Even in large rivers navigation has become problematic, raising costs and uncertainty among fishermen. It usually takes three to four days to transport fish from Carauari municipality \u2014 a major pirarucu producer \u2014 to Manaus, the Amazon\u00b4s largest city. During the peak of the drought, the trip increased to 10 days, and the freight price has doubled.",
      "Tough as pirarucu are, they are not immune to climate change, according to researcher Adalberto Luis Val from the National Institute for Amazonian Research. He says rising temperatures and severe droughts are exacerbating the \"death trio\" for all fish: warmer water, more CO2 and less oxygen.",
      "The pirarucu has evolved to breathe air but is far from invincible.",
      "\"No fish can regulate body temperature,\" Val said. \"Then there's water scarcity. As its level drops, you start to get a high amount of suspended material, leading to sludge buildup. It sticks to the gill area, blocking the processes that occur there.\"",
      "Fearing deteriorating conditions in the following decades, Coletivo Pirarucu contends that the fishermen should be entitled to compensation for losses caused by climate change. \"This crisis not only challenges the resilience of communities but also highlights the urgent need for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies,\" the nonprofit stated in an open letter last week.",
      "In an e-mail response, James Bessa, a federal official overseeing pirarucu management, said that Ibama, Brazil\u00b4s environmental agency, is working with other public bodies and local fishing associations to reduce the impact of extreme events like droughts and floods. He said there are plans to start scientific studies and closer monitoring to provide insights into ways to support riverine and Indigenous communities in sustaining their fishing activities.",
      "Adevaldo Dias \u2014 a riverine leader who presides over the Chico Mendes Memorial, a nonprofit that assists traditional non-Indigenous communities \u2014 argues that adopting additional public policies to help the fishermen is a matter of climate justice.",
      "\"The Indigenous and riverine peoples have minimal impact on the environment,\" Dias said. \"We know that conserving the forest benefits both us and those outside it. And when extreme climate events occur, they are the most vulnerable.\"",

    "summary": "The attack happened when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.",
    "story": [
      "A suicide bomber blew himself up at a train station in restive southwestern\u00a0Pakistan\u00a0on Saturday, killing at least 26 people, including soldiers and railway staff, and wounding about 62 others, some critically, officials said.",
      "The attack happened when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, according to Hamza Shafqaat, a senior government administrator.",
      "When asked about a security breach that led to the bombing, Shafqaat told reporters that \"it is usually very difficult to stop such suicide attacks.\"",
      "However, Shahid Nawaz, who is in charge of security at Quetta's train station, insisted there was no breach as the attacker was disguised as a passenger and blew himself up among people at the station.",
      "TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform's roof blown apart and a destroyed tea stall. Luggage was strewn everywhere. Most of the victims were taken to a state-owned hospital and some to a military one.",
      "Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department and police said over a dozen soldiers and six railway employees were among the dead at the station, where a walk-through gate has been installed to check whether anyone is carrying explosives. Still, there are multiple other entrances to the station without such security.",
      "A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad.",
      "A senior superintendent of police operations, Muhammad Baloch, said separatists frequently attacked soft targets.",
      "\"When their people are arrested, they also attack in retaliation. We all have to fight this war. We are resilient. Our teams are here and trying to save as many lives as we can.\"",
      "Police said some of the critically wounded passengers had died in the hospital, raising the death toll.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack \"will pay a very heavy price for it,\" adding that security forces were determined to eliminate \"the menace of terrorism.\"",
      "Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry also condemned the bombing and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims, as did the Russian Embassy in Islamabad.",
      "Saturday's assault came a little over a week after a powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in the province, killing nine people, including five children who were nearby.",
      "In August, the BLA carried out multiple coordinated attacks on passengers buses, police and security forces across Balochistan, killing more than 50 people, mostly civilians.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but also least populated province. It is a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province.",
      "The BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is working on major infrastructure projects. The group often demands the halt of all Chinese-funded projects and for workers to leave Pakistan to avoid further attacks.",
      "Last month, the BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside Karachi airport, killing two. Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working in Balochistan and other parts of the country.",

    "summary": "Israel's new offensive has focused on Jabaliya, a densely populated refugee camp where Israel says Hamas had regrouped.",
    "story": [
      "Qatar has decided to suspend its key mediation efforts between Hamas and Israel, officials said Saturday.",
      "A Qatari official briefed on the matter told CBS News that the country is \"stepping back\" as they assess that neither Israel nor Hamas are serious about a deal. The official said Qatar would be happy to resume its role as a mediator if both sides are willing to negotiate seriously.",
      "The Qatari government declined to officially comment on the report.",
      "CBS News can report that the United States asked Qatar last week to kick Hamas out of the negotiation process after the group refused to take up a hostage deal proposed after the death of Yahya Sinwar.",
      "A diplomatic source briefed on the matter told the Associated Press that Israel and Hamas, along with the United States, were informed after the decision was made. The source added that \"as a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose\" in Qatar. The U.S. has been in discussions with Qatar over the right time to close the office.",
      "\"Qatar has played an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal and was instrumental in securing the release of nearly 200 hostages last year,\" a senior administration official told CBS News. \"However, following Hamas's repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.\"",
      "A senior Hamas official told the AP they were aware of Qatar's decision to suspend mediation efforts, \"but no one told us to leave.\"",
      "Qatar's announcement comes after growing frustration with the lack of progress on a cease-fire deal.",
      "\"After rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, (Hamas) leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner. We made that clear to Qatar following Hamas' rejection weeks ago of another hostage release proposal,\" the U.S. senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The Israeli prime minister's office had no comment.",
      "Meanwhile, three separate Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people, including women and children, in Gaza on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials said, while Israel announced the first delivery of humanitarian aid in weeks to hungry, devastated northern Gaza.",
      "There continued to be no end in sight to\u00a0Israel's campaigns against Hamas militants\u00a0in Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon, where Israel's military said that it struck command centers and other militant infrastructure overnight in Beirut's southern suburbs.",
      "One of the strikes in Gaza hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City's eastern Tufah neighborhood, killing at least six people, the territory's Health Ministry said. Two local journalists, a pregnant woman and a child were among the dead, it said. The Israeli army said the strike targeted a militant belonging to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, offering no evidence or details.",
      "Seven people were killed when an Israeli strike hit a tent in the southern city of Khan Younis where displaced people were sheltering, according to Nasser Hospital. It said the dead included two women and a child. The Israeli army didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "And Palestinian medical officials said an Israeli strike hit tents in the courtyard of central Gaza's main hospital, including one serving as a police point. At least three people were killed and a local journalist was wounded, Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah said. It was the eighth Israeli\u00a0attack on the compound\u00a0since March.",
      "The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, said Saturday that 11 aid trucks containing food, water and medical equipment reached the far north of the enclave on Thursday, including the urban refugee camp at Jabaliya. It is the first time any aid has reached the far north of the enclave since Israel began a fresh military campaign there last month.",
      "But not all the aid reached the agreed drop-off points, according to a spokesperson for the U.N. World Food Program, which was involved in the delivery process. In Jabaliya, Israeli troops stopped one of the convoys bound for nearby Beit Lahiya and ordered the supplies to be offloaded, said Alia Zaki.",
      "The announcement comes days ahead of a U.S. deadline demanding that Israel improve aid deliveries across Gaza. Experts have said there is a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza.",
      "Israel's new offensive has focused on Jabaliya, a densely populated refugee camp where Israel says Hamas had regrouped. Other areas affected by the new campaign include Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, situated just north of Gaza City.",
      "The U.N. estimates that tens of thousands of people remain in the area. Earlier this week, the Gaza Health Ministry said that there were no ambulances or emergency crews currently operating north of Gaza City.",
      "Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli army has struck several schools and tent camps, packed with tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to U.N. figures.",
      "The military has continually accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including schools, U.N. facilities and hospitals. The contesting narratives over the use of schools and hospitals go to the heart of the 13-month conflict.",
      "In July, Israeli airstrikes hit a girls' school in Gaza's central city of Deir al-Balah, killing at least 30 people sheltering inside. Israel's military said it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against its troops and store \"large quantities of weapons.\"",
      "More than a year of\u00a0Israel's war against Hamas\u00a0in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say more than half of those killed were women and children. The war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people \u2014 mostly civilians \u2014 and abducting 250 others.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 07:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War, paving the way for German reunification in 1990 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
    "story": [
      "Communist East Germany closed its border in Berlin on Aug. 13, 1961, when it erected a wall that eventually turned into an increasingly elaborate fortification snaking through the city and around capitalist West Berlin.",
      "The heavily fortified border \u2014the Berlin Wall\u2014\u00a0plugged the last gap between East and West.",
      "On Nov. 9, 1989, the border was opened, and the Berlin Wall ceremoniously came down as the world watched. It marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist dictatorship in East Germany, paving the way for German reunification in 1990 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.",
      "Most of the wall was torn down quickly after, but 35 years later, there are still places where visitors can see its remains.",
      "What was the Berlin Wall?",
      "The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 and for 28 years, it stood as the front line of the Cold War between the Western world order, led by the U.S., and the Soviets.",
      "East Germany's leadership had already sealed off the country's main border with West Germany, which snaked from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia, in 1952.",
      "The 96-mile-long wall was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germany from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing Germany. It cut through the middle of the city center and surrounded West Berlin.",
      "But not even barbed wire and the Wall could stop people from fleeing. The efforts to perfect the border fortifications in Berlin continued until 1989.",
      "President John F. Kennedy's pledge for freedom",
      "President John F. Kennedy toured West Germany on June 26, 1963. During a speech to a crowd of about 150,000 people in West Berlin, he pledged that the United States would defend the city's freedom.",
      "\"Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free,\" he said. \"When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one, and this country and this great continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe.\"",
      "\"When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades,\" Kennedy added.",
      "Then he closed with his now iconic phrase: \"All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words,\u00a0Ich bin ein Berliner.\"",
      "\"Tear down this wall!\"",
      "President Ronald Reagan, commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin, spoke at the base of the Brandenburg Gate, near the Berlin Wall, on June 12, 1987. Due to the amplification system being used, Reagan's words could be heard in East Berlin.",
      "During his address, the American president made the now famous command, \"Tear down this wall!,\" addressing the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.",
      "Reagan's speech on that day is considered by many to have ushered the beginning of the end of the Cold War, which culminated with the fall of the Soviet Union.",
      "When did the Berlin Wall fall?",
      "In the late 1980s, the power of the Soviet Union began to waver, particularly when Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1985. He abandoned the Brezhnev Doctrine, a central political principle of Soviet foreign policy that demanded limited sovereignty of the Warsaw Pact nations.",
      "This allowed the Eastern Bloc of states to shift their own foreign policies, and on May 2, 1989, Hungary dismantled its border fence \u2013 making the first hole in the \"Iron Curtain.\"",
      "In East Germany, a growing protest movement and a migration wave to the West forced the dictatorship there to end in 1989. A new travel law mistakenly announced on Nov. 9, 1989, led to an onslaught of people to rush the Berlin Wall.",
      "How did the Berlin Wall fall?",
      "The Bornholmer Strasse crossing in Berlin was the first to open that night. Border guards, who hadn't received orders to let anyone pass, gave way under pressure from a large crowd demanding to be let through after an off-handed announcement of new regulations by Politburo spokesperson\u00a0G\u00fcnter Schabowski.",
      "New border crossings were created, leaving behind large gaps in the Wall. Border soldiers began dismantling fences and other obstacles.",
      "In June 1990, the systematic dismantling of the Wall began, and pieces of the concrete were sold all over the world. Some sections were placed under protection as historical monuments.",
      "The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for the unification of Germany on Oct. 3, 1990, less than a year after the border reopened. The demolition of the Wall ended in 1994.",
      "Where can you see sections of the Wall today?",
      "Today, there is a section of Wall slabs with photos and a series of plaques \u2013 including an alert sent by the Associated Press' Germany service \u2013 that stands at the former Bornholmer Strasse crossing in Berlin.",
      "The longest section of Wall remaining in Berlin is in the so-called East Side Gallery, where the once-gray concrete slabs are covered with murals that were painted by 118 artists after the opening of the border.",
      "Otherwise, the Wall has largely disappeared now and much of the former \"death strip\" \u2014 between the exterior wall that faced West Berlin and an interior wall that faced the East \u2014 has been built over.",
      "Among the exceptions is a strip of the former border at the Bernauer Strasse memorial site in downtown Berlin, and there are fragments dotted around elsewhere in the city and on its edges.",
      "In most cases, the main East-West German border outside Berlin consisted of heavily fortified fences rather than walls. There were a few exceptions, however: most famously in the village of Moedlareuth, divided between Bavaria and the eastern region of Thuringia, which earned the nickname \"Little Berlin.\" Part of Moedlareuth's border can still be seen today.",
      "What is Checkpoint Charlie?",
      "One of the most famous \u2013 and most visited crossings commemorating the Wall in Berlin \u2013 is Checkpoint Charlie.",
      "The historic U.S.-controlled border crossing between the East and West stood for three decades. There, Allied guards registered members of the American, British and French forces before trips to East Berlin, and foreign tourists could find out about their stay there.",
      "In October 1961, it famously became the scene of a tank confrontation between Americans and Soviet forces who took up position and faced each other with weapons primed.",
      "The checkpoint booth was removed on June 22, 1990, about half a year after the wall opened. The original booth is now on display in the Allied Museum in Berlin-Zehlendorf. A photo of former U.S. Army tuba player Seargent Jeff Harper is part of series of photographs hanging nearby the original location commemorating the last Allied soldiers in Berlin in 1994.",

      "\"I just always wondered, where he died, how he died, it was just a little part of a puzzle piece that was missing in my life,\" Eisenhauer told CBS News.",
      "For decades, the family was resigned to the fact that it would never know. That is, until a few months ago.",
      "Eisenhauer was at her home in Syracuse, Nebraska, this past summer when she received a message from Christophe Ligere, a French historian, from the small village of Grez-sur-Loing, in central France. The message read, in part, \"On the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of France, we pay tribute to Private William Walters.\"",
      "Ligere had found Walters' name in the diary of an eyewitness to his death, and he immediately felt like he had to find Walters' family. Ligere conducted some research and located the Walters' family tree, and from there he found the online obituary of another relative of Eisenhauer, through which he left her that message.",
      "\"We were looking for our soldier,\" Eisenhauer's daughter, Jan Moore, told CBS News. \"We did not know that he was their soldier, too.\"",
      "As Eisenhauer learned from Ligere, in August 1944, American troops began liberating the village of Grez-sur-Loing. It was a joyous day, but there was one casualty: while crossing the Loing River into town, Walters' boat capsized and he drowned at the age of 20.",
      "After Ligere tracked down Walters' family, he invited them to France to honor their shared hero and the sacrifice he made here. Eisenhauer and her daughter and son, Jan and Allen, made the trip in September.",
      "Marc Perrot had witnessed Walters' death at the age of 13.",
      "\"They went looking for him and found him,\" Perrot explained in an interview with France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. \"They did a lot of things to try to revive him, but it didn't work.\"",
      "Perrot met Eisenhauer and showed her where they laid her father to rest prior to his body being returned to the U.S.",
      "\"They covered him with flowers,\" Eisenhauer said of the French. \"It's just amazing, the care that they gave him.\"",
      "This week, Eisenhauer returned to her father's grave in Cass County, Nebraska.",

    "summary": "Spain is sending a marine research vessel to scan the seafloor off Valencia's coast in hopes of finding vehicles and people missing after devastating flash floods.",
    "story": [
      "Barcelona \u2014 A Spanish research vessel that investigates marine ecosystems has been abruptly diverted from its usual task to take on a new job: Helping in the increasingly desperate search for the missing from Spain's deadly floods. As the dire work continued in the eastern province of Valencia to find the victims of the disaster and clean up the mess left behind, more torrential rain unleashed flash floods farther north along the coast, near Girona.",
      "The 24 crew members aboard the Ram\u00f3n Margalef were preparing Friday to use its sensors and submergible robot to map an offshore area of about 14 square miles \u2014 the equivalent of more than 5,000 soccer fields \u2014 to see if they can locate vehicles that last week's catastrophic floods swept into the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The hope is that a map of sunken vehicles could lead to the recovery of bodies. Nearly 100 people have been officially declared missing, and authorities admit that is likely more people are unaccounted for, in addition to more than 200 declared dead.",
      "But the severe weather was still causing problems further north in the Catalonia province, where heavy rain triggered severe flash floods Friday in the town of Cadaques, sweeping dozens of cars that had been parked in a  normally dry riverbed through the town and piling them up against a bridge, creating a blockage that worsened the flooding in the town.",
      "There were no reports immediate reports of casualties or major structural damage, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Pablo Carrera, the marine biologist leading the Ram\u00f3n Margalef mission off Valencia's coast estimated that in 10 days his team would be able to hand over useful information to police and emergency services. Without a map, he said, it would be practically impossible for police to carry out an effective and systematic recovery operation to reach vehicles that ended up on the seabed.",
      "\"It would be like finding a needle in a haystack,\" Carrera told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "Many cars became death traps when the tsunami-like flooding hit on Oct. 29.",
      "The boat will join a wider effort by police and soldiers who have expanded their searches for bodies and the missing beyond the devastated towns and streets. Searchers have used poles to probe into layers of mud while sniffer dogs tried to find scent traces of bodies buried in canal banks and fields. They are also looking at beaches that line the coast.",
      "The first area the Ram\u00f3n Margalef is searching is the stretch of sea off the Albufera wetlands, where at least some of the water ended up after ripping through villages and the southern outskirts of Valencia city.",
      "Spanish state broadcaster said Friday that the body of one woman had been found on the beach after she went missing when the rushing water swept through her town of Pedralba, roughly an hour's drive from the coast.",
      "Carrera, 60, is head of the fleet of the research vessels run by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, a government-funded science center under the umbrella of the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "He boarded the Ram\u00f3n Margalef in Alicante, located on Spain's south coast, from where it will set sail to reach Valencia's waters before dawn Saturday. The plan is to go straight to work with the 10 scientists and technicians and 14 sailors working non-stop in shifts. The boat also helped research the impact from the lava flow that reached the sea from the 2021 La Palma volcano eruption in Spain's Canary Islands.",
      "Finding a body at sea, Carrera said, is highly unlikely. So the focus is on large objects that shouldn't be there.",
      "The boat's submergible robot loaded with cameras can dive to a depth of 60 meters to attempt to identify cars. Ideally, they will try to locate license plates, although visibility could be extremely limited and the cars could be smashed to bits or engulfed in the muck, Carrera said.",
      "In the longer term, he said his team will also evaluate the impact of the flood runoff on the marine ecosystem.",
      "Those findings will contribute to initiatives by other Spanish research centers to study Spain's deadliest floods of the century.",

    "summary": "Five newly elected councilors in Dawson City, Canada, have refused to swear a mandatory oath of allegiance to Britain's King Charles III.",
    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014\u00a0A small Canadian town's five recently elected councilors refused to swear an oath of allegiance to Britain's King Charles III during their investiture ceremony on Tuesday, despite it being a legal requirement in the northwestern Yukon territory where Dawson City is located.",
      "Under a regulation in the Yukon's Municipal Act, elected councilors are required to swear an oath of allegiance to the British monarch, who remains the official head of state of Canada despite the colonial-era link no longer giving the king any real power in the country.",
      "The oath of allegiance to the monarch is typically taken by Yukon councilors when they're sworn into office, right after they give the separate oath of office, within 40 days of their election.",
      "If the politicians fail to do so, their election can be declared null and void, resulting in the office being left vacant and potentially leading to a special election, known as a by-election.",
      "Dawson City Mayor Stephen Johnson told CBS News partner network CBC News the decision was made collectively by all the newly elected councilors before the swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday, in support of one new councilor who broached the idea.",
      "\"Early in the morning we all got an email and it was from Darwyn,\" Johnson told CBC News, referring to council member Darwyn Lynn. \"And he said I'm hesitant to sign on to this basically because of background history with [the] Crown and First Nations in Canada.\"",
      "Four of the new councilors present at the meeting on Tuesday did take their oaths of office, with the fifth new member expected to do so after returning from vacation, according to the regional Yukon News outlet. But all five agreed not to take the other oath, pledging allegiance to the British crown.",
      "Yukon Director of Community Affairs Samantha Crosby told the CBC that it's uncommon for a whole group of new councilors to refuse to take the oath of allegiance collectively. She said she'd been in touch with the councilors to find a solution to avoid having to call a by-election for Dawson City that would result in the councilors and the mayor losing their seats.",
      "\"The requirement to swear or affirm the oaths is in the [municipal] act itself, but the prescribed forms are under a regulation within the municipal act,\" Crosby told CBC News. \"So the language that is within the forms is a regulation and not within the actual legislation. To make changes to legislation is a very long process, but to make changes to a regulation is something that can be done in a much quicker fashion.\"",
      "King Charles is the official head of state for a number of former British colonies, including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Jamaica and many other so-called Commonwealth nations. He and his family have faced mounting criticism from Indigenous communities across the globe, however, highlighting the complex relationship between the former colonial power and communities that were exploited and marginalized to build the British empire of the 19th century.",

      "\"You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us \u2014 our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,\" Thorpe yelled at Charles and Queen Camilla as they sat on a stage next to Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",

      "Amsterdam \u2014 Antisemitic rioters \"actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them\" after a soccer match in Amsterdam, authorities in the Netherlands said Friday, with police reporting five people hospitalized and dozens detained after a night of violence that the mayor said had shamed the city. The police did not mention the nationality of any of those injured or arrested after the unrest in the Dutch capital.",
      "The five people treated in the hospital were released, while some 20 to 30 people suffered light injuries, police said. At least 62 suspects were arrested, with 10 still in custody, the city's public prosecutor, Ren\u00e9 de Beukelaer, told reporters at a news conference Friday.",
      "The attacks were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. In the U.S., President Biden said antisemitism must be fought wherever it emerges.",
      "\"The Antisemitic attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam are despicable and echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted,\" Mr. Biden said on social media. \"We've been in touch with Israeli and Dutch officials and appreciate Dutch authorities' commitment to holding the perpetrators accountable. We must relentlessly fight Antisemitism, wherever it emerges.\"",
      "Police said security will be beefed up at Jewish institutions across the city, which has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.",
      "The Israeli government said it was \"doing everything to ensure the safety and security of our citizens who were brutally attacked in the horrific anti-Semitic incident in Amsterdam,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement. \"It was decided that it was not necessary to send a professional rescue mission to the Netherlands. Instead, the effort will be focused on providing civil aviation solutions for the recovery of our citizens.\"",
      "Israel's airports authority said a plane sent to Amsterdam to bring Israeli citizens back home after the violence had arrived back at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv Friday afternoon. Israel's government initially ordered two planes, but Netanyahu's office later said it would work to help citizens arrange commercial flights.",
      "Condemnation of the violence poured in from around Europe. \"Antisemitism has absolutely no place in Europe, and we are determined to fight it and to fight all forms of hatred,\" said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. \"We want Jewish life and culture to thrive in Europe.\"",

      "The violence erupted despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the soccer stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who'd feared clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli club.",
      "\"This is a very dark moment for the city, for which I am deeply ashamed,\" Halsema said at a news conference on Friday. \"Anti-semitic criminals attacked and assaulted visitors to our city, in hit-and-run actions.\"",
      "There were clashes before the game, too, as Maccabi fans were among hundreds to march through central Amsterdam in a pro-Israel demonstration, during which flares were lit and Palestinian flags hung on some streets were torn down amid chants of \"death to the Arabs.\" Anger rose as Israeli supporters disrespected a moment of silence.",
      "Afterward, youths on scooters and on foot crisscrossed the city in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing quickly to evade police, Halsema said.",
      "As CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio reports, bloody brawls between rival fans around soccer games in Europe \u2014 so called hooliganism \u2014 are not new, but since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas and other militants sparked the still-raging war that has killed tens of thousands of people, antisemitism has surged across the continent and beyond.",
      "Maccabi's CEO, Ben Mansford, spoke to reporters at Israel's international airport as some fans returned. \"Lots of people went to watch a football game ... to support Israel, to support the star of David,\" he said.

      "Netanyahu's office barred any members of the country's military from flying to the Netherlands for an indefinite period.",

      "\"Completely unacceptable antisemitic attacks on Israelis. I am in close contact with everyone involved,\" he added, saying he'd spoken with Netanyahu and \"emphasized that the perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted. It is now quiet in the capital.\"",

    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",

      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",

      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",

      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",

      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",

      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails.

Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",

Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers.

      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",

      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",

If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",

The malware we\u2019re talking about here is just like that. It\u2019s called FakeCalls, and every time researchers figure out how it infects devices, it evolves with new ways to hide.",

      "FakeCalls is a banking trojan that focuses on voice phishing, where victims are deceived through fraudulent calls impersonating banks and are asked to share sensitive information. Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",
      "The default call handler app manages incoming and outgoing calls, allowing users to answer, reject or initiate calls. Giving these permissions to a malicious app, as you can imagine, carries serious risks.",
      "When a user gives the app permission to set itself as the default call handler, the malware gets the green light to intercept and mess with both outgoing and incoming calls.

Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. Also, avoid clicking on any links in messages or emails that seem suspicious. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices.

      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:25:23 -0500",
    "summary": "To protect a declining bird species, President Biden&apos;s administration has proposed tighter restrictions on energy development across federal land in the U.S. West.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "BIDEN ADMIN EXAMINES NEW MEASURES TO PROTECT BIRD SPECIES",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across their 270,000-square mile range.",
      "Now officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling platforms located outside the protected areas.",
      "In this May 9, 2008, file photo, male sage grouses fight for the attention of females southwest of Rawlins, Wyo. \u00a0\u00a0 (Jerret Raffety/The Rawlins Daily Times via AP)",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \"drill baby drill.\" During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but they were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on some government lands to continue. She said the plan was based on the best science to protect the bird.",
      "\"For too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\" Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with environmentalists, industry representatives and Republican elected officials.",
      "Most of the land at issue \u2014 about 4,700 square miles \u2014 is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon lamented what he called the administration's \"extreme indifference\" to his state. The Republican governor said new layers of federal regulation would hinder practical solutions for the grouse.",
      "\"We have shown how to successfully manage this bird and do so in a way that allows for protection of core habitat alongside responsible development,\" Gordon said.",
      "Environmentalists, meanwhile, said officials had squandered a chance to put in place meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles of public lands.",
      "\"It's death by a thousands cuts,\" said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \"The Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't. The fact that it's less bad doesn't mean it's not bad.\"",
      "Federal officials predicted only minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by an energy industry representative. Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\"So they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\" Sgamma said. \"That\u2019s disingenuous.\"",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",

      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

    "title": "Trump just realigned the entire political map. Democrats have 'no easy path' to fix it.",
    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump raised eyebrows when he decided to hold a campaign rally in the Bronx in late May.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump raised eyebrows when he decided to hold a campaign rally in the Bronx in late May.",
      "The New York City borough has been one of the most Democratic-leaning counties in the country for years. Trump won just 15% of the vote there in 2020 and 9% in 2016. Democrats viewed it as a stunt amid his criminal trial in Manhattan. Some suggested the crowd was made up of supporters far from the borough\u2019s borders.",
      "In the end, the rally stood out not because of anything Trump said or did, but because of who showed up. It was one of the most diverse rallies of his entire political career. And as Tuesday\u2019s results started pouring in, it was clear Trump was on to something bigger, not just in the Bronx but throughout the country. His coalition had changed.",
      "Results so far show Trump winning more than 27% of the vote in the Bronx, shrinking his margin of defeat there significantly. It was the best result for a Republican presidential candidate in the borough in 40 years.",
      "Back in May, one of the Democratic officials who expressed doubt over who exactly showed up to Trump\u2019s rally was Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who represents the district where the rally took place. Those doubts were erased on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI despise Donald Trump,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI feel like he is a threat to the norms of liberal democracy, but he\u2019s a brilliant politician. He has brilliant intuitions, and he knew that he was making inroads into communities of color.\u201d",
      "Torres said it would be unimaginable for a Democrat to win roughly 30% of the vote in one of the reddest, most rural counties in America, and he said the results necessitate a serious reckoning in the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s greatest breakthrough lies not in cracking the blue wall in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d Torres added. \u201cHis greatest breakthrough lies in breaking the blue wall in the reliably Democratic urban centers of America, like the ultimate blue wall of the Bronx.\u201d",
      "The most dramatic and headline-grabbing shift of the 2024 election was among Latino men, who backed President Joe Biden by 23 points in 2020 and Trump by 12 points this year, according to the NBC News exit poll. It\u2019s a trend that showed up in pre-election polling and was clear in precinct results.",
      "But the shifts in the 2024 election were even more wide-ranging than that. Working-class voters shifted more toward Trump. So too did women, Asian Americans, voters of color at large, young voters, rural voters, independents and voters with household incomes under $100,000, the exit poll showed. Most demographics that were already favorable to Trump became even more so. Most that were favorable to Democrats became less so.",
      "The only places Vice President Kamala Harris made real gains on Trump were with white, educated and wealthy voters.",
      "In short, Trump has been able to engineer a near-wholesale rightward shift in the electorate in ways that he couldn\u2019t in 2016 or 2020, when it seemed as though different constituencies were racing past each other in opposite directions. The trends have blown up long-held Democratic and Republican narratives about how Americans vote. It\u2019s leading Democrats far beyond Torres to sound the alarm about the party\u2019s future as Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement grew to become the most diverse GOP coalition in generations and gave Trump the most decisive victory for a GOP presidential nominee in two decades.",
      "\u201cInsane, truly insane,\u201d a Republican operative who described themselves as \u201cshell-shocked\u201d by the results on Tuesday said of his improvements with Democratic and Republican constituencies. Like others interviewed for this article, the operative would only speak anonymously to offer candid analysis of party strategy. \u201cIt was just everyone.\u201d",
      "An \u2018anti-establishment\u2019 election",
      "Now, people on both sides of the fight are trying to nail down exactly what caused these shifts, and there are a few explanations.",
      "First and foremost is anger over rising prices and a sense that Democrats did not do enough to curb them, even as inflation has slowed. Second is anger over a rise in undocumented immigration that Biden\u2019s administration only started to combat years into his presidency, after opinions had hardened. And Democrats felt there was a clear impact from Trump\u2019s nonstop ad campaign targeting Harris for comments she made in 2019 about favoring taxpayer funding to provide gender transition care to prison inmates.",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., thought Trump\u2019s gains with women \u2014\u00a0in addition to independents and minority voters \u2014 were particularly notable, given how much focus Democrats placed on abortion rights in the first presidential election after the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs ruling in 2022.",
      "\u201cYes, abortion was on the ballot,\u201d Mace said. \u201cBut so too was the kitchen table, so too was gasoline, so too was immigration.\u201d",
      "Moreover, Trump clearly benefited in the closing weeks from being seen as the change agent and the anti-establishment figure, a sense that was boosted by his campaigning with onetime independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who represented Hawaii as a Democrat but is now a Republican; and Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t like the traditional parties,\u201d Mace said of these voters. \u201cPeople hate both sides, quite frankly. And what Trump brings to the table is he\u2019s \u2026 seen as a man of the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guy just won the popular vote, something nobody predicted this year,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s this anti-establishment theme that he is tapped into that nobody has done in a really long time.\u201d",
      "Trump himself commented on these shifts during an interview with NBC News, saying: \u201cI started to see realignment could happen because the Democrats are not in line with the thinking of the country.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also specific outreach Trump engaged in to reach minorities and young voters, particularly his efforts to campaign on popular (and not explicitly political) podcasts in an effort to reach young men, a demographic that has leaned Democratic in recent years. The NBC News exit poll showed Harris winning voters under 30 years old by 11 points this fall after Biden won them by 17 points in 2020.",
      "\u201cInflation hurt everyone regardless of their age, skin color or where they live,\u201d Mike Berg, a senior official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told NBC News. \u201cTrump\u2019s strategy of going on apolitical podcasts to reach low-propensity voters was also a stroke of genius.\u201d",
      "Tim Murtaugh, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said the moment he realized the president-elect was going to have a large swing in his favor among voters who were not expected to be in the GOP coalition came when the Teamsters declined to endorse in the campaign, breaking decades of precedent. That came after Biden moved to shore up the union\u2019s pensions.",
      "Not only did the Teamsters decline to endorse, Murtaugh noted, but they also released polling in swing states, including Pennsylvania, that showed Trump winning over large numbers of their members.",
      "\u201cTo me this was a huge, clear sign that Donald Trump was remaking the party into something that prioritizes the concerns of working people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way he began MAGA in 2015, spotlighting our trade imbalances and the resulting destruction of jobs that went along with it. He has empathy for the situations and frustrations of the people, and their sense that the government and the elites don\u2019t care about them.\u201d",
      "NBC News exit polling showed Trump winning voters in households with incomes under $100,000 by 4 points, after Biden carried that demographic by 17 points in 2020. Voters who never attended college favored Trump by 28 points in the exit poll after backing him by 8 points in 2020.",
      "\u2018We have no easy path here\u2019",
      "For one Democratic policy aide, the biggest concern was movement among younger voters. Feelings about masculinity were leading segments of Gen Z to break from the longtime trend of younger voters being more liberal, this person said.",
      "\u201cThese kids are like, \u2018Trump is cool. He\u2019s the man, he\u2019s great. He\u2019s cool. It\u2019s cool, bro. He\u2019s cool,\u2019\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018Whoa, whoa, Latinos and African Americans like Republicans now.\u2019 No, the men wanted a man. The men wanted a man\u2019s man.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have no easy path here,\u201d this person continued. \u201cWe need to convince people that we\u2019re the adults in the room, that we care about the economy, that we care about their pocketbook, that we\u2019re cool dudes, that were not communists, that we\u2019re not sexualizing their children, that we\u2019re ... not going to ban Zyn.\u201d",
      "Democrats acknowledged Harris was facing a difficult environment and only had just over 100 days to make her case to the country. They also pointed to her losses being much less substantial in battleground states where she invested time and resources than in places like New York, New Jersey and Illinois, where the campaign was not messaging to voters.",
      "But there was also a sense among Democrats that having a tightly controlled candidate and campaign, as they have in a string of recent presidential elections, might not be as beneficial as longtime party hands believe it to be.",
      "\u201cPeople yearn for \u2026 someone to tell them the goddamn truth,\u201d a Pennsylvania Democrat said. \u201cRegardless of whether we know that Trump is not speaking the truth, people believe that he is. And what happened [Tuesday] was a Louisville Slugger baseball bat going upside the head of the Democratic Party for not telling people the truth. And the truth is, some of their lives suck. Acknowledge it. No one has the perfect solution to fix it, but acknowledge it.\u201d",
      "This person had a stark warning for Democrats over the voters who drifted from the party this cycle, particularly younger voters.",
      "\u201cOne cycle, OK. Two cycles, if they vote that way, you\u2019re starting to teeter on the edge, and if an individual votes for a party three straight cycles in a row, you\u2019re never getting them back,\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd so you better go and listen to these people tomorrow, or you\u2019re going to lose them, and it will be generational.\u201d",
      "State and national polling previewed these shifts: In a pre-election handbook, the progressive Working Families Party found a lot of moderate, working-class voters who straddle the line between the two parties fit into a demographic they dubbed the \u201canti-woke traditionalists\u201d \u2014 largely agreeing with Democrats on economic policy and with Republicans on social norms.",
      "A progressive strategist said that while Harris did have good messaging around fighting price gouging and making housing more affordable, the vice president did not make clear that voters were right to be upset with their economic conditions.",
      "\u201cThey had good solutions that I think would have fit well,\u201d this person said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell people that something they\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t right. And I think that\u2019s kind of where they messed up.\u201d",
      "Back in the Bronx, an overwhelmingly Black and Latino county, Torres said many Americans felt the country was headed in the wrong direction, were concerned with rising prices and were frustrated by \u201can unprecedented wave of migration,\u201d particularly in places like New York, that strained local governments.",
      "\u201cWe were hoping that Donald Trump was so radioactive that we could overcome that challenge, but we were wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "He said part of the problem was the Biden administration worrying too much about upsetting the party\u2019s left flank, particularly on immigration, which he said slowed its response to dealing with the crisis. Backlash over immigration and inflation led to a \u201ccomplete collapse of Latino support\u201d for Democrats, he added.",
      "\u201cWe have to expunge from our vocabulary the words \u2018we have a messaging problem,\u2019\u201d Torres said. \u201cIf 70% of the country thinks we\u2019re headed in the wrong direction, we do not have a messaging problem. We have a reality problem. Inflation and immigration are not messaging problems. These are reality problems.\u201d"

      "A resistance movement was born in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, sending thousands of people into the streets wearing pink hats and signs with punchy slogans.",
      "The leaders of left-leaning groups that emerged in response to Trump\u2019s first election say they expect to be just as forceful in pushing back against the policy moves of a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI think that folks are very angry and are going to be turning out,\u201d Rachel O\u2019Leary Carmona, the executive director of Women\u2019s March, told NBC News. But \u201c2016 was a long time ago, a pandemic ago, two presidential terms ago. Things are going to be different. It\u2019s not going to be the same.\u201d",
      "Following Trump\u2019s re-election on Tuesday, scattered protests broke out in Seattle, Chicago, Philadelphia and Berkeley, California, but they haven\u2019t drawn the attention \u2014 or the numbers \u2014 that similar protests garnered in 2016 and early 2017.",
      "Women\u2019s March is already organizing snap rallies and protests for this weekend in New York and Washington, plus a massive \u201cPeople\u2019s March on Washington\u201d the weekend before Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "But in the years since Women\u2019s March and other resistance groups formed to combat the rhetoric and policies of the Trump era, the movement has evolved beyond just rallies and marches, O\u2019Leary Carmona said.",
      "\u201cI think this is a different movement \u2014 an older and more mature movement,\u201d she said. \u201c2016 was a volunteer-led groundswell. ... Now it\u2019s a movement beyond the moment \u2014 it\u2019s not about visibility, but building power.\u201d",
      "For example, Women\u2019s March, a group born out of many women\u2019s immediate reaction to Trump\u2019s first election, has evolved into a group that seeks to \u201cbuild a multi-racial feminist future\u201d by working to combat disinformation online, fighting to cancel student debt, promoting progressive paid parental leave\u00a0policies and more.",
      "\u201cWe have a heavy focus on absorption,\u201d O\u2019Leary Carmona said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just for people to hit the streets, we need to build political power.\u201d",
      "This time around, compared to 2016, \u201cwe have connections to people that are building policy,\u201d she added.",
      "Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that works to mobilize voters and organizers, echoed O\u2019Leary Carmona in a post on X Thursday.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about winning, we need to take some hard lessons and admit where we were wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s also not enough to dust off the 2016 \u2018resistance\u2019 playbook. It\u2019s time for a new playbook.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Mitchell said that \u201cfar-right\u201d political movements are \u201cbanking on their form of chaos to destabilize us so that we move from putting out one fire to another.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cIn some ways, some of that happened in 2016. There was one manufactured crisis after another, and we were trying to mitigate harm, and very much being on the defensive, and in some ways, being flat-footed.\u201d",
      "In 2024, Mitchell said, \u201cWe actually planned for this scenario.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not flat-footed,\u201d he added. \u201cWe believe our mandate is to go on the offensive. Even though we\u2019re experiencing an electoral defeat, we\u2019re reminded that tens of millions of people voted in a rebuke of this man, MAGA, of the Project 2025 rulebook. And it\u2019s those people that we need to organize in the wake of this election.\u201d",
      "Still, in the days following this election, the anti-Trump movement seemed notably quieter online than it did in 2016, with some describing the resistance as \u201ctired\u201d or \u201cdormant.\u201d",
      "On a Thursday-evening video call led by left-leaning groups MoveOn, Indivisible, the Working Families Party and others, leaders told their communities that it was OK to take a beat before fighting onward.",
      "\u201cThe one feeling we cannot allow ourselves to sit in is hopelessness,\u201d MoveOn Executive Director Rahna Epting told the 130,000 viewers gathered on the call.",
      "\u201cI know for some folks on the call, maybe that\u2019s a tall order right now, to ask you to keep hope alive,\u201d she added. \u201cBut hope is the fuel we need, hope that there\u2019s still more people that believe in love and peace over hate and divisiveness.\u201d",
      "Epting told NBC News that she\u2019s hopeful about the future of the movement, pointing to the thousands of people who joined the call and other metrics, like the fact that over 8,000 attendees on Thursday expressed interest in hosting their own community gatherings in the following weeks.",
      "\u201cTrump would like for us to believe that our power has evaporated in a single night. We won\u2019t allow that mindset to sink in, so we\u2019ll equip our base with resources to process what happened and funnel them into action instead of hopelessness,\u201d Epting said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "Mitchell also pointed to the fact that the 2017 Women\u2019s March, where millions across the nation protested ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration, was held months after the election, not days. \u201cIt just seems very premature\u201d to suggest the energy isn\u2019t there, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the movement. We can\u2019t fold like picnic chairs because we fielded a loss,\u201d O\u2019Leary Carmona said.",
      "She offered a metaphor: \u201cIf you personally are tired, it\u2019s like a choir long note: One person drops out and the rest carry the tune. Rest, but don\u2019t stay at rest. There\u2019s a movement that\u2019s here, that\u2019s moving.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 18:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "While Trump has sought to pressure the Fed to cut rates, consumer rates on mortgages and other loans are determined by a range of factors largely outside of the president\u2019s control.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As a candidate, Donald Trump promised to relieve consumers of high interest rates. As president, doing so will likely be a slow process largely outside of his control.",
      "Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that he would bring down interest rates without elaborating on how. He has suggested the president should have a say in determining rates set by the Federal Reserve and publicly berated the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, for not lowering rates sooner.",
      "But while Trump has put a lot of emphasis on the Federal Reserve as a way to reduce the interest paid by consumers or businesses, the rates on mortgages and other longer-term loans are outside of any one person\u2019s or institution\u2019s control. Instead, those rates are largely determined by the bond market, where investors are looking at a range of long-term risks, like the likelihood of high inflation returning, prospects for economic growth and the United States\u2019 ability to pay back its debts in the decades to come.",
      "\u201cI think macro trends are way more important,\u201d said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the Federal Reserve has a lot of control like they used to.\u201d",
      "The Federal Reserve plays a part in influencing interest rates by setting the amount that banks have to pay short term to borrow money from each other in order to carry out their daily business. That amount can trickle down to how much lenders then charge consumers for a loan, but it isn\u2019t always the case.",
      "Mortgage rates rose after the Federal Reserve cut rates in September for the first time since the pandemic, and despite the Fed cutting rates again on Nov. 7, mortgage rates are expected to continue to rise in the coming days based on the trends in the bond market, said Ralph McLaughlin, senior economist for Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cThe idea that the president can directly influence the Fed rate is a little unrealistic, but the broader policies, or expectations of policies, have a much more direct effect,\u201d\u00a0said McLaughlin.",
      "Trump has no direct control over the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, which is determined by a committee that includes seven members appointed to 14-year terms along with five regional Reserve Bank presidents. Under the current law, the president can\u2019t fire Powell or any member of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors without \u201ccause,\u201d so removing any of those members because of a disagreement over interest rates would be challenged in court.",
      "Trump has previously tried to influence the Fed with his rhetoric. During his first term, Trump said Powell, whom he appointed in 2018, was a bigger enemy to America than China\u2019s President Xi Jinping and posted on Twitter that Powell had a \u201chorrendous lack of vision\u201d and \u201cno \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision!\u201d",
      "Powell said during remarks on Nov. 7 that if Trump asked him to resign, he wouldn\u2019t do so, and that it wasn\u2019t permitted under the law for Trump to fire him or any members of the Federal Reserve board.",
      "While Trump has acknowledged that he likely doesn\u2019t have the power to set rates or fire Powell, he\u2019s indicated he isn\u2019t going to stop voicing his views on what the Fed should be doing.",
      "\u201cI think I have the right to say, \u2018I think you should go up or down a little bit,\u2019\u201d Trump said at the Chicago Economic Club last month. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should be allowed to order it, but I think I have the right to put in comments as to whether or not the interest rates should go up or down.\u201d",
      "Trump will eventually get an opportunity to start remaking the board in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term will expire.\u00a0Trump said in February that he wouldn\u2019t reappoint Powell to another term. Whomever he nominates as Powell\u2019s replacement will have to be confirmed by the Senate, which Republicans are projected to control.",
      "To try to push for change at the Fed before 2026, Trump economic adviser Scott Bessent has floated the idea of creating a \u201cshadow\u201d Fed chair by appointing Powell\u2019s replacement well before his term is up, according to an interview with Barron\u2019s last month. While that person wouldn\u2019t have the power to make decisions, their commentary could signal to the financial markets where the body is going, said Bessent, chief executive of the hedge fund Key Square, whom Trump has called \u201cone of the most brilliant men on Wall Street.\u201d",
      "Outside of any actions Trump may take with the Federal Reserve, interest rates are expected to begin ticking down later this year if inflation remains under control, economists have projected.",
      "Trump\u2019s own policies, though, could drive rates higher if they signal a return to higher-than-normal inflation. Trump has proposed putting sweeping tariffs on all goods imported into the U.S., including a 60% duty on imports from China. If past tariffs are any indication, that would drive up the prices consumers pay for goods and could trigger another wave of inflation that would push rates higher. Significant tax cuts that put more money in people\u2019s pockets could also contribute to higher inflation.",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s going to put money in consumers\u2019 pockets, whether it\u2019s tax breaks, tax credits or other types of stimulus, does have the potential of driving prices higher, which would mean higher mortgage rates,\u201d said McLaughlin.",
      "One of the most effective ways to lower rates over the longer term will likely be keeping inflation at around its current level of 2% to 3% and for the U.S. to take steps to reduce its deficit and rein in spending, which would make the bond market more favorable to lenders, said Smetters.",
      "\u201cRight now, capital markets are making this bet that eventually Congress and the president are going to get their act together to eventually stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio,\u201d said Smetters. \u201cAs soon as they stop believing that to be true, then you\u2019re going to see the 30-year mortgage really pop up.\u201d",
      "But lowering rates in the short term to levels seen during pandemic is unlikely unless there is a major economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of policies that the president has at his disposal that can really lower rates,\u201d said McLaughlin. \u201cOther than policies that might be damaging to the economy itself.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s ambitious agenda could face pushback from an institution he has done much to shape: the Supreme Court.",
      "With a 6-3 conservative majority including three Trump appointees, the court has spent the last few years buffeted by criticism from the left. But if the justices stick true to their stated jurisprudential principles, the new administration could end up on the losing side at least some of the time, legal experts say.",
      "\u201cI think if President Trump\u2019s executive agencies tried to stretch the law beyond the breaking point in the same kind of way that the Biden administration has done then, yes, the courts will be a check on that power,\u201d said John Malcolm, a lawyer at the Trump-allied Heritage Foundation.",
      "Brianne Gorod, a lawyer with the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said while in certain rulings the court has failed to hold Trump accountable, it still has a key role to play.",
      "\u201cTrump has made clear that going forward he is going to be even less concerned with abiding by the Constitution and federal law than he was the last time he was in the White House, so the courts, including the Supreme Court, are on notice that their role as a vital check in our constitutional system will be tested,\u201d she added.",
      "History is a guide, with Trump losing several high-profile cases in his first term, including over his attempt to wind down the program that protects young immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d from deportations and a plan to add a citizenship question to the census.",
      "The Trump administration also suffered a big loss when in 2020 the court ruled 6-3 to extend workplace discrimination protections to LGBTQ employees, a decision that angered conservatives.",
      "He won his fair share of cases too, including over his travel ban on people entering the U.S. from mostly Muslim-majority countries.",
      "Trump\u2019s losses often derived from the court faulting federal agencies for not following the correct procedures when issuing new policies.",
      "\u201cI do think the Supreme Court will make the administration do the real work that is required to make regulatory change,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.",
      "The court has changed somewhat since then, with Trump\u2019s third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, joining right at the end of his first term, creating the current 6-3 majority. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to replace fellow liberal Justice Stephen Breyer.",
      "Trump could also have the opportunity to further shape the court in his new term, with the possibility of one or more of the senior conservative justices stepping down.",
      "During the Biden years, the court has set new precedents while ruling against the administration that in theory apply to Trump too.",
      "The court embraced a theory called the \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d in striking down Biden policies that relied upon broad use of executive power that wasn\u2019t explicitly authorized by Congress, including his broad plan to forgive student loan debt.",
      "The court earlier this year also overturned a 40-year-precedent that gave deference to federal agencies, soon to be controlled again by Trump, in interpreting vaguely worded laws.",
      "Trump could get more leeway on certain issues where the president traditionally gets more deference from courts than the law constrains him.",
      "Immigration, foreign policy and international trade are all areas where Trump has flexibility to act, Adler said.",
      "Another contentious issue the Supreme Court could back Trump on would be on any attempt to enforce the Comstock Act, an obscure 19th-century law that prohibits abortion-related materials from being transported by mail between states. It could potentially be applied to abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "But on other issues, like environmental regulation, efforts to deregulate more than laws allow for could be difficult to defend, he added.",
      "One issue where Trump would almost certainly enter choppy legal waters is his plan to end birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the Constitution.",
      "Proposals to withhold funding to liberal jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with the administration on, for example, rounding up undocumented immigrants or rolling back protections for transgender students in schools, would also lead to litigation that could end up before the justices.",
      "Although the Biden administration suffered many high-profile losses during the last four years, on abortion, gun rights, regulatory issues and more, it also chalked up some major victories in cases it intervened in.",
      "Last year, the court rejected a conservative plea to further weaken the landmark Voting Rights Act and also turned away a fringe legal theory that would have given state legislatures unfettered power over election rules. The court this year nixed a lawsuit aimed at overturning federal approval of mifepristone.",
      "But some on the left have no confidence that the court will hold Trump to the same standards as Biden, citing in part the ruling earlier this year granting Trump some immunity over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. The court actions in that case derailed the chance of a trial taking place before the election.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court supermajority has given us no reason to expect that it will be anything other than be a rubber stamp for his worse impulses,\u201d said Alex Aronson, who runs Court Accountability, a left-leaning legal group. \u201cThey\u2019ve previewed their support for an imperial presidency and have demonstrated their willingness to strip rights and freedoms from the American people.\u201d"

    "summary": "Throughout his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump signaled he would resume federal executions if he won and make more people eligible for capital punishment, including child rapists, migrants who kill U.S. citizens and law enforcement officers, and those convicted of drug and human trafficking.",
    "story": [
      "Throughout his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump signaled he would resume federal executions if he won and make more people eligible for capital punishment, including child rapists, migrants who kill U.S. citizens and law enforcement officers, and those convicted of drug and human trafficking.",
      "\u201cThese are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,\u201d Trump said of traffickers when he announced his 2024 candidacy. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,\u201d he added.",
      "While it remains unclear how Trump would act to expand the death penalty, anti-death penalty groups and criminal justice reform advocates say they are taking his claims seriously, noting the spree of federal executions that occurred during his first term.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight this tooth and nail, and we\u2019re going to seek to uphold the constitutional principals that do not call for this expansion,\u201d said Yasmin Cader, an ACLU deputy legal director and the director of its Trone Center for Justice and Equality.",
      "At the tail end of Trump\u2019s first term, 13 federal inmates were put to death \u2014 even as the pandemic led states to halt executions because of Covid concerns in prisons. The cases included the first woman executed\u00a0by the federal government in nearly 70 years; the youngest person based on the age when the crime occurred (18 at the time of his arrest); and the\u00a0only Native American on federal death row.",
      "No president had overseen as many federal executions since Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s, and the U.S. government had not executed anyone for more than 15 years until Trump revived the practice.",
      "His then-attorney general, William Barr, had said that the federal government \u201cowed it to victims to carry out the sentence imposed by the justice system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Joe Biden had\u00a0campaigned on\u00a0passing legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, but pulled back on that in office. Instead, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a moratorium in 2021 to review the federal execution protocols.",
      "States administering the death penalty have had to defer executions in recent years because of an inability to procure the necessary lethal injection drugs. Alabama, however, has found a novel alternative \u2014 nitrogen gas \u2014 to put two inmates to death this year.",
      "Biden\u2019s aides say he supports death row inmates serving life sentences without probation or parole. It\u2019s unclear what, if anything, he may do on the issue before leaving office.",
      "Meanwhile, the Justice Department under Biden and Garland has not sought the death penalty in federal cases that could have warranted it, and has even withdrawn death penalty sentences in about two dozen cases that it had inherited. Federal prosecutors can ask a death penalty committee at the department for permission to file capital charges, but ultimately the attorney general signs off.",
      "There are currently 40 inmates, all men, on federal death row, according to the nonpartisan Death Penalty Information Center. They include gunmen responsible for mass shootings in South Carolina and Pittsburgh and the man convicted in the Boston Marathon bombing.",
      "Lee Kovarsky, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and co-director of the school\u2019s Capital Punishment Center, said Biden still has the ability to act before Trump takes office by commuting the sentences of the entire row of inmates to life in prison.",
      "Justice will still be served, Kovarsky said, because \u201cthey\u2019re not getting out.\u201d",
      "More than 40 federal laws provide for the death penalty, with nearly all dealing with murder or an illegal act that results in death. Whether Trump would expect federal prosecutors to seek death in cases that don\u2019t explicitly involve murder \u2014 for instance, the rape of a child \u2014 remains to be seen, but the Death Penalty Information Center notes that a 2008 Supreme Court ruling prohibits the execution of people convicted of raping children and says it\u2019s unclear if the use of the federal death penalty would be constitutional in certain cases in which someone was not killed.",
      "Kovarsky said that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would only be able to pursue a capital case where the crime is legally authorized for the death penalty. Otherwise, he would need Congress to change the law allowing for that particular crime.",
      "In addition, ramping up executions again when he becomes president can\u2019t happen immediately, Kovarsky added, given the logistics of getting a death warrant signed, ensuring the drug protocol is available and the expected legal challenges that would arise.",
      "But Ruth Friedman, the director of the Federal Capital Habeas Project, which has represented some of the prisoners on death row,\u00a0said the concern is real that the next Trump administration will move quickly on the death penalty, and even if it\u2019s not executing someone immediately, it could begin with the reinstatement of the execution protocol.",
      "\u201cThey will reverse the changes this [Biden\u2019s] administration has made,\u201d Friedman said.",
      "She added that the current makeup of the Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has already shown it will generally back the death penalty \u2014 even in cases that have garnered attention over claims of innocence, misconduct and racial bias.",
      "But Friedman said it\u2019s possible that lawmakers from both parties could speak out if they are uncomfortable with how the issue progresses. She pointed to a death penalty case in Texas in which both Republican and Democratic legislators were successful in\u00a0stopping\u00a0the execution of Robert Roberson\u00a0last month\u00a0because of concerns over an outdated medical diagnosis\u00a0that led to his capital conviction in 2003.",
      "Robert Dunham, the director of the Death Penalty Policy Project, an independent research program, said Trump\u2019s intention to execute child rapists in particular may appeal to his \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d supporters, but is more nuanced. He said the National Registry of Exonerations, which tracks sentences resulting from wrongful convictions, has found that child victim cases pose special dangers of wrongful conviction because they \u201ccan be extremely emotional, often pitting family members against each other,\u201d and frequently rely upon false forensic evidence.",
      "Child sexual assault cases are the second most frequent charge to result in no-crime\u00a0wrongful convictions, behind cases in which police planted drugs on defendants, the registry said in 2022.",
      "\u201cThe legal system by itself is already highly traumatic for these vulnerable kids, and subjecting them to the psychological trauma of being part of a system that could kill their caregiver and also subjecting them to the trauma of having to testify, be interrogated and spend years reliving the abuse during the appeals process \u2014 if this is a way to protect kids,\u201d Dunham said, \u201cthis is the wrong way to do it.\u201d",
      "Expanding the death penalty may only worsen existing racial disparities among inmates on the federal row as well as continue to disproportionately affect intellectually disabled defendants of color, Dunham added.",
      "Given that, Cader of the ACLU said, it will be imperative for all branches of government to be a check on Trump\u2019s attempts to broaden use of the death penalty when constitutionality is called into question.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is that he\u2019s already shown us that he will act on these promises,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "America\u2019s prospective homebuyers absorb harsh reality: Mortgage rates probably aren\u2019t coming down for a while.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans have been holding back from jumping into the housing market in the hopes that mortgage rates will decline. So far, they haven\u2019t.",
      "The average 30-year mortgage rate has been above 6% for two years \u2014 and is likely to stay above that level for the foreseeable future, experts say.",
      "A combination of better-than-expected growth and uncertainty about the impact of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s economic proposals, especially on inflation and the deficit, are combining to keep rates elevated. That\u2019s despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s push to lower its key federal funds rate to make borrowing in the economy easier.",
      "\u201cSixes are the new normal,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, a mortgage listing services group, referring to 6% mortgage rates.",
      "Interest rates in general have been on the decline. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced it was lowering its key federal funds interest rate by a quarter point against a backdrop of relatively cooler inflation and a moderating jobs market. In September, the Fed cut the rate by half a percentage point.",
      "Cutting that rate often starts a waterfall effect that lowers other lending rates across the economy.",
      "\u201c[Thursday\u2019s] rate cut benefits anyone that borrows based on short-term lending,\u201d said Brian Rehling, head of global fixed income strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cThis includes corporations and consumers tackling credit card debt, and sometimes car buyers. It\u2019s really not going to be impacting mortgage rates at all.\u201d",
      "Mortgage rates work differently. Their movements are more closely tied to demand for government bonds. When demand for those increases, mortgage rates tend to fall.",
      "But thanks to strong economic growth in the pandemic era, demand for those bonds has weakened.",
      "Meanwhile, concerns about the growing budget deficit and the potential need for the U.S. government to issue even more debt have further weakened investor appetite to purchase government bonds, experts say.",
      "Trump\u2019s victory in Tuesday\u2019s presidential election only exacerbated those concerns.",
      "Analysts have warned Trump\u2019s plan to impose blanket tariffs on some $3 trillion in goods could reignite inflation. The Trump campaign has pushed back on the idea that the tariffs would prove inflationary, citing his past success in increasing tariffs in his first administration.",
      "However, the scope of those tariffs was much smaller than what Trump has recently proposed.",
      "Other economists believe tariffs could have a more benign effect. But Trump\u2019s other proposals, like extending or widening tax cuts, could wind up sending interest rates higher on their own if they cause demand to heat up again.",
      "If the economy is strong enough to weather the impact from Trump\u2019s tariffs, that could push mortgage rates higher, according to Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association \u2014 especially if more money floods into the system from the government.",
      "\u201cInvestors expect somewhat stronger economic growth, higher inflation, and larger deficits,\u201d Fratantoni said in a note to clients Thursday. As a result, rates \u201cwill remain within a fairly narrow range over the next year, with mortgage rates moving higher on signs of economic strength and more stimulative fiscal or monetary policy, or lower if it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Fratantoni said in a note to clients Thursday.",
      "Mortgage rates have come down from the peak of nearly 8% seen last fall, when both inflation and economic growth were at pandemic-era highs.",
      "Yet the still-elevated rates have put a stranglehold on large swaths of the housing market, especially sales of existing homes, which fell to a 14-year low in September, according to the National Association of Realtors.",
      "\u201cSeptember\u2019s low level of existing home sales primarily is due to very high mortgage rates, not Hurricane Helene or the approaching elections,\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a recent note.",
      "\u201cLooking ahead, we expect housing market activity to remain subdued well into 2025,\u201d he continued.",
      "The interest-rate environment has created a \u201clock-in\u201d effect whereby current mortgage holders are unwilling to give up the lower rates at which they had purchased their existing homes, which currently average about 4%, Tombs said.",
      "\u201cAs a result, interest payments for most existing homeowners will jump if they move home, creating a huge incentive to stay put,\u201d he said.",
      "A glimmer of hope for potential buyers can be found in the trend of slowly increasing housing supply, which has also helped cool the rapid home-price growth seen in the early part of the pandemic era. NBC News\u2019 Home Buyer Index, which captures the difficulty of buying a home in various U.S. markets, has now eased for three straight months.",
      "Yet there remain wide variances among regions in terms of where inventory is coming online, and the overall trend has slowed again recently.",
      "It all adds up to conditions that will remain difficult for homebuyers looking to purchase at a reasonable price in a quality market, and especially for those who\u2019d expect to see a significant return on their housing investment, even in the medium term, Sturtevant said.",
      "Yet the market will resolve over time thanks to one major factor, she said: demographics. The baby boomers who have dominated the market in recent decades will not be around forever, she explained. While that means much more incremental growth for home prices, it will be much better for creating a more balanced market.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a demographic ledge, a slow slope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time, but it will be good for stability, if not great for home price appreciation.\u201d"

      "Kirk Herbstreit announces the death of his service dog, Ben, beloved for crashing football broadcasts",
      "Through the first four weeks of this season, Philadelphia had a negative point differential. In their last four games, the Eagles have won by a combined 54 points, including multiple wins by at least 20.",
      "The biggest reason for the turnaround has been the mistake-free play of Hurts. He has been criticized for his limits as a passer in the past, but his effectiveness has pulled Philly out of its early season malaise.",
      "In the first four games of the season, Hurts threw only four touchdowns with three interceptions while running for two more touchdowns. During that span, he never had a passer rating above 88.8.",
      "In his last four games, Hurts has thrown six scores with no picks and has run for six more touchdowns. And he hasn\u2019t had a passer rating below 119.3.",
      "Hurts is on pace to throw for more yards than last season but with fewer interceptions. He\u2019s also posting career highs in passer rating (102.4) and yards per attempt (8.3), with the second-best quarterback rating (65.4) of his career.",
      "And while he hasn\u2019t reached the heights of his 2022 campaign on the ground, he\u2019s running more often than he did last season \u2014 while fumbling at a lower rate.",
      "Picking up the slack in Philadelphia's rushing attack has been Saquon Barkley. Signed over from the divisional rival New York Giants in the offseason, Barkley has paid massive dividends in the backfield.",
      "Through eight games, Barkley has run for 925 yards (on a robust 5.9 yards per carry) with six touchdowns. He has eight runs of at least 20 yards or more \u2014 two more than last season\u2019s leading rusher, D\u2019Andre Swift, had all year. Barkley is also running for 115.6 yards per game, 50 more than Swift a season ago.",
      "With Barkley in the mix, the Eagles have the second-best rushing attack in the NFL, while Hurts\u2019 life as a passer has been made easier \u2014 and more efficient.",
      "Meanwhile, the defense has taken a stingy turn under new defensive coordinator Vic Fangio.",
      "Philadelphia is allowing only 290.1 yards per game, the third best mark in the NFL. (A year ago, the defense allowed 356.1, the seventh worst.) The defensive line continues to be a menace, ranking 10th and second, respectively, in pass rush win rate and run stop win rate for the second season in a row.",
      "Put it all together, and on paper the Eagles have all the traits of a bona fide Super Bowl contender. Or at least all the clich\u00e9s.",
      "They run the ball well. They stop the run. The quarterback doesn\u2019t make mistakes and can still hit big plays to talented receivers.",
      "After how poorly last season ended \u2014 and how uninspiring the first month of this one was \u2014 it\u2019s fair to be a little reserved in praise of Philadelphia. (The team, not the city.)",
      "But if the Eagles of the last month are the same version the rest of the NFL will see moving forward? That\u2019s the kind of team that\u2019s usually still one of the best headed into February."

      "Traps were set up in the area as police used thermal technology in an attempt to track and recapture the monkeys, police said earlier this week. Staff members at Alpha Genesis were working to entice them with food as well.",
      "On Friday, Greg Westergaard, CEO of Alpha Genesis, told NBC News via email: \"The incident yesterday involved a new enclosure, and occurred because the caretaker who was doing routine cleaning and feeding failed to secure two separate doors. It was purely human error.\"",
      "Westergaard, in Saturday's police statement, said that efforts to recover the monkey will continue through the weekend \"and for as long as it takes.\"",
      "Police urged the public to stay away from the area surrounding Alpha Genesis as the monkeys can be easily startled. Officers also asked the public to refrain from using drones in the area because it \"frightens the animals but also elevates their stress levels.\"",
      "A drone flew over the area Friday, police said, which \"caused a disturbance spooking the animals, further complicating efforts to facilitate their safe return.\"",
      "Police also asked the public to call 911 if they spot any of the remaining primates."

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "A patch of snow in Scotland known for lingering year-round has melted for the fourth consecutive year.It's just the 10th time in more than three centuries that it has vanished.Such snow patches can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change.",
      "A patch of snow in Scotland known for lingering year-round has melted for the fourth consecutive year.",
      "It's just the 10th time in more than three centuries that it has vanished.",
      "Such snow patches can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change.",
      "A patch of snow in the Scottish Highlands dubbed the Sphinx typically lingers year-round, staying frozen through the summer. But it has melted away for the fourth consecutive year \u2014 only the 10th time in more than three centuries that has happened.",
      "The Sphinx, which adorns the side of Braeriach, the third-highest mountain in Great Britain, was historically considered the United Kingdom\u2019s longest-lasting snow patch because it was known for sticking around even after most snow and ice vanished every year in Scotland\u2019s Cairngorms mountain range.",
      "In September, however, the patch melted entirely, as it has every year since 2021. In the 20th century, by comparison, the Sphinx vanished just three times.",
      "Such snow patches tend to be sensitive to small fluctuations in temperatures, experts say, so they can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change. The melting of the Sphinx, then, offers clues about how climate change is affecting the Scottish Highlands \u2014 and by extension the rest of the country and the world.",
      "\u201cThe Sphinx melting for four years in a row now is a good indicator of these changes,\u201d said Grant Moir, CEO of the\u00a0Cairngorms National Park\u00a0Authority. \u201cClimate change was always relatively high up on the agenda for us as a national park, and we\u2019re seeing impacts on the Highlands more and more. You get an idea from the Sphinx of the changes that are happening to our climate.\u201d",
      "In addition to snowmelt, Moir said, the Highlands are experiencing more frequent storms and floods, interspersed with longer periods of dry weather that increase the risk of wildfires.",
      "Shifts in snow cover across the Highlands have consequences for the mountain ecosystems, since they alter the natural hydrological cycle in which snow gradually melts from mountains and flows into streams.",
      "\u201cThere are big impacts on things like salmon spawning grounds and on the river overall,\u201d Moir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to mitigate some of these impacts, and we\u2019ve got to see what we can do differently to adapt to these changing patterns.\u201d",
      "The Cairngorms park is also home to some of the U.K.\u2019s endangered species, he added.",
      "The ripple effects extend beyond the natural environment. Around 18,000 people live in the national park, and roughly 2 million visit every year, Moir said. But severe storms and floods can displace residents, cause millions of pounds in damage and disrupt valuable tourism in the region, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been about trying to get that the right balance, to make sure that nature and people can thrive in the national park,\u201d Moir said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to make sure we invest in things that are good for nature, good for biodiversity and good for people, as well.\u201d",
      "Iain Cameron, author of \u201cThe Vanishing Ice: Diaries of a Scottish Snow Hunter,\u201d has spent more than 25 years studying snow across Scotland\u2019s hills and mountains. Every year, he publishes his findings on the region\u2019s snow cover in the Royal Meteorological Society\u2019s annual report.",
      "Last year, Cameron wrote that the fate of the Sphinx was a tale with \u201clittle prospect of a happy ending.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere can be little doubt that we are witnessing a shift in language used to describe patches of snow in Scotland,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn days gone by the adjective that best described The Sphinx was \u2018permanent\u2019, but that had to change to \u2018semi-permanent\u2019, then to \u2018perennial\u2019 and then \u2018semi-perennial\u2019. But even this descriptor will not be able to withstand the pressure put on it by continual disappearance. We are now looking at an epoch where patches of snow are possibly going to be only occasional survivors.\u201d"

      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels.",

      "\u201cWe urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,\u201d the South\u2019s joint chiefs said in a statement.",

      "Kim has shown more hostility this year toward Seoul\u2019s conservative government \u2014 which maintains a hard line on Pyongyang \u2014 with the North abandoning its long-standing goals of reconciliation with its war-divided rival and\u00a0rewriting its constitution\u00a0to cement South Korea as a permanent adversary.",
      "North Korea also\u00a0blew up sections of its unused road and rail routes\u00a0linked with the South in October in a symbolic display of anger toward Seoul, and opened November with a flight-test of a\u00a0new intercontinental ballistic missile\u00a0to dial up pressure on Washington.",
      "South Korean officials say North Korean activities to disrupt GPS signals from western border regions increased as the country began\u00a0launching trash-carrying balloons\u00a0toward the South in late May, which the North described as a retaliation against South Korean civilian activists\u00a0flying anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets\u00a0across the border.",
      "Aside from North Korea\u2019s weapons demonstrations and non-conventional provocations, there\u2019s growing concern over its reported provision of\u00a0military equipment and troops to Russia\u00a0to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine. South Korean officials say the deepening military alignment between Moscow and Pyongyang could possibly result in Russian technology transfers that increases the threat posed by Kim\u2019s military nuclear program."

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 12:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Denzel Washington\u2019s kids \u2014 John David Washington, Malcolm Washington and executive producer Katia Washington \u2014 worked together to film \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Storied actor Denzel Washington has taken on the project of adapting August Wilson\u2019s cycle of 10 plays that portray slices of Black life in each decade of the 1900s. But it is Washington\u2019s kids \u2014 John David Washington, Malcolm Washington and executive producer Katia Washington \u2014 who have taken the baton for \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d one of Wilson\u2019s two Pulitzer Prize-winning works.",
      "John David, a Golden Globe-nominated actor in his own right, stars alongside \u201cTill\u201d star Danielle Deadwyler. Malcolm, John David\u2019s brother, makes his directorial debut in the film, set in the 1930s during the Great Depression.",
      "Boy Willie (played by John David) has come to Pittsburgh from Mississippi with a truck full of watermelons he intends to sell. But he\u2019s really there to cash in on the family\u2019s prized piano, a priceless heirloom kept in his sister\u2019s home, to buy the land of the man who once enslaved his family.",
      "Standing in his way is his sister Berniece, portrayed by Deadwyler, who refuses to sell the piano. For the mother of one, the piano, with the faces of their ancestors carved into it, is their family legacy. And though she will not play it, she cannot let Boy Willie sell it.",
      "John David told NBC News he was pulled to \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d because \u201cI needed to find myself. It was forcing me to answer questions I maybe have been avoiding for a long time within myself \u2014 with my spirituality, with my faith, with my upbringing.\u201d",
      "Malcolm said he felt a similar pull.",
      "\u201cIn our life, we go through these cycles of being concerned with some part of yourself that you\u2019re trying to wrestle with, trying to have some deeper understanding of yourself in some way. And where I was at that time, \u2018The Piano Lesson\u2019 was the salve for that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was both a thrilling, exciting read, but also dug into these deeper ideas of identity, ancestry and lineage that I was trying to reconcile for myself.\u201d",
      "He said Julie Dash\u2019s 1991 film \u201cDaughters of the Dust\u201d and Barry Jenkins\u2019 Oscar-winning 2016 film \u201cMoonlight\u201d inspired him to dig deeper in his feature film debut without fear. \u201cBoth of those filmmakers are huge influences for me because they are able to portray the Black body and experience with such\u00a0visual poetry,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI think some films that come through the traditional studio system look at the Black experience as this rugged, raw, gritty experience, where sometimes there\u2019s a lot of other feelings in there; there\u2019s a lot of other colors in the palette,\u201d Malcolm said. \u201cAnd that was something that we were after \u2014 this kind of heightened poetry both in character and imagining and visualizing their desires, their imaginings, their nightmares, their fears, anxieties, but always putting it through this filter of beauty in some way, poetry in some way, because it\u2019s all connected in that way.\u201d",
      "Deadwyler said she was drawn to her character\u2019s internal push and pull of \u201ctrying to be a devout mother, trying to consider what it means to be in the potential of a new relationship, while navigating this new world and space that she\u2019s in. I feel like that\u2019s just been the last 10 years of my life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI get that she\u2019s laboring on so many levels: grief and loss, memory, motherhood, the potential of love, and then these other forces that are drawing her into her unknown self, into a greater sense of self,\u201d she added.",
      "Caught between Boy Willie and Berniece is Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Doaker, their uncle who referees their many battles.",
      "Jackson goes back to Wilson\u2019s beginnings; he played Boy Willie in the 1987 premiere of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d at the Yale Repertory Theatre and was the understudy for the role when the show debuted on Broadway three years later. When Jackson\u2019s wife, LaTanya Richardson Jackson, revived the play for Broadway in 2022, Jackson handed the reins to John David and nestled into the role of Doaker alongside him. John David says he felt the pressure to live up to the role Jackson originated with director Lloyd Richards. \u201cThey were crafting the huge monologues every night [that] you have to learn, and now, I\u2019m saying the words that he spoke first, in front of him, every night,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there was an immense amount of pressure.\u201d",
      "Encouragement from Jackson and actor Michael Potts, who has performed in several Wilson plays and appears in the film, helped John David feel \u201cwelcomed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gave me the confidence that if they think I\u2019m good enough to do it, and if I got their trust, then I\u2019m on the right path.\u201d",
      "Their father, Denzel Washington, began fulfilling a \u201cduty\u201d to adapt Wilson\u2019s \u201cCentury\u201d cycle of 10 plays with his 2016 film \u201cFences,\u201d serving as both star and director. His co-star Viola Davis won her first Oscar for the film, set in 1957. Washington then followed four years later with the 1920s-set \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom,\u201d also starring Davis. It was Chadwick Boseman\u2019s final on-screen performance before he died from cancer in 2020.",
      "Charles Dutton and Alfre Woodard starred in the first film adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d in 1995, a decade before Wilson\u2019s death. And now at the helm of this latest version of Wilson\u2019s revered work are the Washington brothers and their sister Katia, who is an executive producer; their mother and Denzel\u2019s wife, Pauletta Washington, appears in the film with their sister Olivia Washington.",
      "Weeks before the adaptation hit movie theaters, it was screened at Morehouse College in Atlanta, John David\u2019s alma mater. He said the event was emotional for him and Deadwyler, an alum of neighboring Spelman College, especially during the historically Black colleges\u2019 joint homecoming, dubbed \u201cSpelHouse,\u201d in October.",
      "\u201cI never would have thought that I would bring a film that I\u2019m so proud of, that really helped me become \u2014 or at least I believe \u2014 the artist I want to be back to the school that helped mold me as a man,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about legacy,\u201d Deadwyler said. \u201cAnd so, if this piece is about legacy, the Morehouse-Spelman connection is a major footprint in that legacy-building. To look at the students eager and super excited, all their hands up to ask questions in the Q&A, wanting to take a picture, because I think this is significant, and they understand their significance. It\u2019s just beautiful to do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d is in theaters now and will begin streaming on Netflix Nov. 22."

      "Ronan referenced the murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard in the U.K. in 2021. Everard was a marketing executive who disappeared while walking home from a friend's house in London. A week later, Everard's body was found about 50 miles away in a wooded area in Kent.",

      "Ronan reflected on the tragedy, saying, \"She followed all the rules, and she did everything that she was supposed to do to keep herself safe, and she still ended up dead. And I think that that really opened up this conversation for everyone back at home.\"",
      "The actor said that since Everard's murder, she's been more vocal in her personal life, with both women and men.",
      "\"So it was just sort of something that naturally came up on the show, but it's been really interesting to see what the response has been like,\" she said. \"It's just sort of gone everywhere.",
      "\"I think people have needed something like this, on a platform like that, to go, OK, we can talk about it now, and just to talk about that,\" she continued. \"And of course, it's not something that guys would have to think about, but I think it's really important for us, for all of our little young girls that are growing up, that we go like, 'This is the this is the mentality that a woman has to have, and that a young girl has to have every day ever.'\"",
      "Reps for Redmayne, Mescal and Washington did not respond to a request for comment from TODAY.com last month."

      "Qatar has halted its mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas, citing a lack of willingness from both sides to engage constructively, according to a diplomatic source briefed on the matter.",
      "Qatar\u2019s participation hinged on both parties demonstrating real interest in resolving the conflict, according to the diplomat. Qatari officials, however, concluded that recent negotiation efforts have been more focused on optics than peace efforts.",
      "The diplomat noted that Qatar may resume its role if both sides reach an impasse and show genuine intent to negotiate.",
      "Under U.S. pressure, Qatari officials had warned Hamas\u2019 political bureau earlier that it was no longer welcome in the country amid frustration over stalled hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Israel, according to a senior U.S. administration official and two diplomats briefed on the matter.",
      "\u201cHamas has been told that if this continues then Qatar cannot continue to host them,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cQatar has become increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress toward a cease-fire by both Hamas and Israel,\u201d one of the diplomats told NBC News Saturday morning.",
      "Later, a diplomat added that Qatar had informed the Israelis and Hamas that \u201cas long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate. As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose.\u201d",
      "The officials did not say whether Hamas had been given a deadline, how its diplomats had responded to the warning to leave, or where they would go.",
      "The move is one of multiple indications that the Biden administration is intensifying efforts to achieve a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal before leaving office.",
      "The U.S. asked Qatar to kick out Hamas about two weeks ago when the group rejected another hostage proposal after Israel killed Hamas\u00a0leader Yahya Sinwar, the senior U.S. administration official told NBC News late Friday.",
      "Qatar agreed and told Hamas\u2019 political leaders about the decision about 10 days ago, the U.S. official said.",
      "\u201cHamas is a terrorist group that has killed Americans and continues to hold American hostages,\u201d the official said. \u201cAfter rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner.\u201d",
      "According to one of the diplomats briefed on the matter, once the Qataris had made their decision, they notified Israel and Hamas as well as the U.S. administration.",
      "\u201cAll sides were given no advance warning and were informed after the decision was made,\u201d they said.",
      "A Hamas official contacted for comment did not respond. Israeli officials were not immediately available for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Majed bin Mohammed Al Ansari, said on X that reports about the Hamas office in Doha were \"inaccurate,\" adding that the office's purpose is to be a \"channel of communication between the concerned parties.\" He characterized Qatar's efforts to mediate between the parties as \"currently stalled.\"",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has played a key role in mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, alongside Egypt and the U.S.",
      "While housing Hamas representatives in Qatar has long been considered an advantage by negotiators, the country is under growing pressure from the U.S., with the outgoing Biden administration anxious to force Hamas and Israel into a deal before leaving office.",
      "Meanwhile, Qatari leaders face the prospect of a hawkish Trump presidency and more powerful Republican lawmakers with little tolerance for rounds of unsuccessful talks or patience with the kingdom\u2019s role as a go-between for militants.",
      "The U.S. request to oust Hamas came partly because of the death of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and it coincided with the unsealing of indictments for Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, who is known to be living in Qatar, according to the U.S. official.",
      "The official said the U.S. is still trying to secure the release of hostages \u2014 and that the administration believes that expelling Hamas from Doha will place more pressure on the organization.",
      "\u201cQatar has played an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal and was instrumental in securing the release of nearly 200 hostages last year,\u201d the senior U.S. official said. \u201cHowever, following Hamas\u2019 repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "About 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which killed around 1,200. Of those, about 100 remain in captivity, with a third believed to be dead. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the ensuing war, and Israeli forces have destroyed much of the blockaded enclave.",
      "The two diplomats told NBC News that Hamas was also asked to leave Qatar and relocate to Turkey in April. But after officials there failed to compel Hamas to agree to a hostage deal, that decision was quickly reversed, they said.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to bring them back to Qatar because they needed to continue the talks and couldn\u2019t do it while in Turkey,\u201d one diplomat said.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is running to be Senate leader, co-sponsored a bill this year calling on the U.S. to reconsider Qatar\u2019s Major Non-NATO Ally Status.",
      "\u201cQatar has not been a good ally or partner to the United States for years,\u201d Scott said at the time.\u00a0\u201cIts recent behavior dealing with Hamas is telling.\u201d",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have also criticized Qatar for not forcing Hamas into an agreement.",
      "Earlier this year, Qatar defended its role in negotiations, with its embassy in Washington issuing a statement saying that Doha\u2019s capacity as mediator \u201cexists only because we were asked by the United States in 2012 to play this role.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlaming and threatening the mediator is not constructive, especially when the target is a friend and a Major Non-NATO Ally that presently hosts 10,000 U.S. troops and America\u2019s largest military presence in the Middle East,\u201d it added.",
      "Qatar has housed Hamas\u2019 political bureau for over 20 years, and before the war, provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual assistance, with the knowledge and cooperation of the Israeli government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.",
      "Hamas\u2019 leadership is divided between a military wing, based in Gaza, and the political bureau, whose top officials have been based in Qatar. That included Ismail Haniyeh, who led Hamas\u2019 political bureau from 2017 to July 2024, when he was killed while on a diplomatic visit to Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, in an assassination believed to have been carried out by Israel.Where Hamas would relocate is not clear, but Iran might be one option.",
      "Hamas met with Iran\u2019s president in Doha last month. The \u201cZionist entity today in Gaza and Lebanon pierce the heart of every human being,\u201d President Masoud Pezeshkian said at the time. \u201cThis pain is even greater for those of us who consider the oppressed Palestinian people as our brothers in faith.\u201d"

    "summary": "An Israeli court on Sunday partially lifted a gag order on a case investigating leaks of classified Gaza documents suspected to involve one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",

      "Tensions between the rival Koreas have escalated as North Korean leader\u00a0Kim Jong Un flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program\u00a0and engages in electronic and psychological warfare, such as flying thousands of balloons to\u00a0drop trash and anti-South Korean propaganda leaflets\u00a0in the South.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels.",
      "While warning aircraft and vessels near western border areas, South Korea\u2019s military did not specify how North Korea was interfering with GPS signals or detail the extent of disruptions.",
      "\u201cWe urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,\u201d the South\u2019s joint chiefs said in a statement.",
      "North Korea\u2019s GPS signal disruptions and balloon campaigns highlight the vulnerability of South Korea\u2019s Incheon International Airport, its main transportation gateway, analyst Sukjoon Yoon recently wrote on the North Korea-focused 38 North website.",

      "\u201cNo major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety,\u201d Yoon wrote.

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "A patch of snow in Scotland known for lingering year-round has melted for the fourth consecutive year.It's just the 10th time in more than three centuries that it has vanished.Such snow patches can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change.",
      "A patch of snow in Scotland known for lingering year-round has melted for the fourth consecutive year.",
      "It's just the 10th time in more than three centuries that it has vanished.",
      "Such snow patches can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change.",
      "A patch of snow in the Scottish Highlands dubbed the Sphinx typically lingers year-round, staying frozen through the summer. But it has melted away for the fourth consecutive year \u2014 only the 10th time in more than three centuries that has happened.",
      "The Sphinx, which adorns the side of Braeriach, the third-highest mountain in Great Britain, was historically considered the United Kingdom\u2019s longest-lasting snow patch because it was known for sticking around even after most snow and ice vanished every year in Scotland\u2019s Cairngorms mountain range.",
      "In September, however, the patch melted entirely, as it has every year since 2021. In the 20th century, by comparison, the Sphinx vanished just three times.",
      "Such snow patches tend to be sensitive to small fluctuations in temperatures, experts say, so they can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change. The melting of the Sphinx, then, offers clues about how climate change is affecting the Scottish Highlands \u2014 and by extension the rest of the country and the world.",
      "\u201cThe Sphinx melting for four years in a row now is a good indicator of these changes,\u201d said Grant Moir, CEO of the\u00a0Cairngorms National Park\u00a0Authority. \u201cClimate change was always relatively high up on the agenda for us as a national park, and we\u2019re seeing impacts on the Highlands more and more. You get an idea from the Sphinx of the changes that are happening to our climate.\u201d",
      "In addition to snowmelt, Moir said, the Highlands are experiencing more frequent storms and floods, interspersed with longer periods of dry weather that increase the risk of wildfires.",
      "Shifts in snow cover across the Highlands have consequences for the mountain ecosystems, since they alter the natural hydrological cycle in which snow gradually melts from mountains and flows into streams.",
      "\u201cThere are big impacts on things like salmon spawning grounds and on the river overall,\u201d Moir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to mitigate some of these impacts, and we\u2019ve got to see what we can do differently to adapt to these changing patterns.\u201d",
      "The Cairngorms park is also home to some of the U.K.\u2019s endangered species, he added.",
      "The ripple effects extend beyond the natural environment. Around 18,000 people live in the national park, and roughly 2 million visit every year, Moir said. But severe storms and floods can displace residents, cause millions of pounds in damage and disrupt valuable tourism in the region, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been about trying to get that the right balance, to make sure that nature and people can thrive in the national park,\u201d Moir said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to make sure we invest in things that are good for nature, good for biodiversity and good for people, as well.\u201d",
      "Iain Cameron, author of \u201cThe Vanishing Ice: Diaries of a Scottish Snow Hunter,\u201d has spent more than 25 years studying snow across Scotland\u2019s hills and mountains. Every year, he publishes his findings on the region\u2019s snow cover in the Royal Meteorological Society\u2019s annual report.",
      "Last year, Cameron wrote that the fate of the Sphinx was a tale with \u201clittle prospect of a happy ending.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere can be little doubt that we are witnessing a shift in language used to describe patches of snow in Scotland,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn days gone by the adjective that best described The Sphinx was \u2018permanent\u2019, but that had to change to \u2018semi-permanent\u2019, then to \u2018perennial\u2019 and then \u2018semi-perennial\u2019. But even this descriptor will not be able to withstand the pressure put on it by continual disappearance. We are now looking at an epoch where patches of snow are possibly going to be only occasional survivors.\u201d"

      "A Spanish research vessel that investigates marine ecosystems has been abruptly diverted from its usual task to take on a new job: Helping in the increasingly desperate search for\u00a0the missing from Spain\u2019s floods.",
      "The 24 crew members aboard the Ram\u00f3n Margalef were preparing Friday to use its sensors and submersible robot to map an offshore area of 36 square kilometers \u2014 the equivalent of more than 5,000 soccer fields \u2014 to see if they can locate vehicles that last week\u2019s\u00a0catastrophic floods\u00a0swept into the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The hope is that a map of sunken vehicles could lead to the recovery of bodies. Nearly 100 people have been officially declared missing, and authorities admit that is likely more people are unaccounted for, in addition to more than 200 declared dead.",
      "Pablo Carrera, the marine biologist leading the mission, estimates that in 10 days his team will be able to hand over useful information to police and emergency services. Without a map, he said, it would be practically impossible for police to carry out an effective and systematic recovery operation to reach vehicles that ended up on the seabed.",
      "\u201cIt would be like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Carrera told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "Many\u00a0cars became death traps\u00a0when the tsunami-like flooding hit on Oct. 29.",
      "The boat will join a wider effort by police and soldiers who have expanded their searches for bodies and the missing beyond the devastated towns and streets. Searchers have used poles to probe into layers of mud while sniffer dogs tried to find scent traces of bodies buried in canal banks and fields. They are also looking at beaches that line the coast.",
      "The first area the Ram\u00f3n Margalef is searching is the stretch of sea off the Albufera wetlands, where at least some of the water ended up after\u00a0ripping through villages\u00a0and the southern outskirts of Valencia city.",
      "Carrera, 60, is head of the fleet of the research vessels run by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, a government-funded science center under the umbrella of the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "He boarded the Ram\u00f3n Margalef in Alicante, located on Spain\u2019s south coast, from where it will set sail to reach Valencia\u2019s waters before dawn Saturday. The plan is to go straight to work with the 10 scientists and technicians and 14 sailors working non-stop in shifts. The boat also helped research the impact from the lava flow that reached the sea from the\u00a02021 La Palma volcano\u00a0eruption in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands.",
      "Finding a body at sea, Carrera said, is highly unlikely. So the focus is on large objects that shouldn\u2019t be there.",
      "The boat\u2019s submersible robot loaded with cameras can dive to a depth of 60 meters to attempt to identify cars. Ideally, they will try to locate license plates, although visibility could be extremely limited and the cars could be smashed to bits or engulfed in the muck, Carrera said.",
      "In the longer term, he said his team will also evaluate the impact of the flood runoff on the marine ecosystem.",
      "Those findings will contribute to initiatives by other Spanish research centers to study Spain\u2019s\u00a0deadliest floods of the century.",
      "Spain is used to the occasional deadly flood produced by autumn storms. But the drought that has hit the country for the past two years and record hot temperatures\u00a0helped magnify these floods, scientists say.",
      "Spain\u2019s meteorological agency said that the 30.4 inches of rain that fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis is an all-time national record.",
      "\u201cWe have never seen an autumn storm of this intensity,\u201d Carrera said. \u201cWe cannot stop climate change, so we have to prepare for its effects.\u201d"

      "The attack happened when nearly 100 passengers were waiting for a train to travel to the garrison city of Rawalpindi from Quetta, the capital of the Balochistan province, according to Hamza Shafqaat, a senior government administrator.",
      "When asked about a security breach that led to the bombing, Shafqaat told reporters that \u201cit is usually very difficult to stop such suicide attacks.\u201d",
      "However, Shahid Nawaz, who is in charge of security at Quetta\u2019s train station, insisted there was no breach as the attacker was disguised as a passenger and blew himself up among people at the station.",
      "TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform\u2019s roof blown apart and a destroyed tea stall. Luggage was strewn everywhere. Most of the victims were taken to a state-owned hospital and some to a military one.",
      "Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department and police said over a dozen soldiers and six railway employees were among the dead at the station, where a walk-through gate has been installed to check whether anyone is carrying explosives. Still, there are multiple other entrances to the station without such security.",
      "A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad.",
      "A senior superintendent of police operations, Muhammad Baloch, said separatists frequently attacked soft targets.",
      "\u201cWhen their people are arrested, they also attack in retaliation. We all have to fight this war. We are resilient. Our teams are here and trying to save as many lives as we can.\u201d",

      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack \u201cwill pay a very heavy price for it,\u201d adding that security forces were determined to eliminate \u201cthe menace of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry also condemned the bombing and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims, as did the Russian Embassy in Islamabad.",
      "Saturday\u2019s assault came a little over a week after\u00a0a powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle\u00a0exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in the province, killing nine people, including five children who were nearby.",
      "In August, the BLA carried out multiple coordinated attacks on passengers buses, police and security forces across Balochistan, killing more than 50 people, mostly civilians.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest but also least populated province. It is a hub for the country\u2019s ethnic\u00a0Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination\u00a0and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province.",
      "The BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar\u00a0Belt and Road Initiative, which is working on major infrastructure projects. The group often demands the halt of all Chinese-funded projects and for workers to leave Pakistan to avoid further attacks.",
      "Last month, the BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside Karachi airport, killing two. Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working in Balochistan and other parts of the country."

    "title": "Pompeii DNA evidence contradicts long-held assumptions about victims buried in ash",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 14:36:32 GMT",
    "summary": "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains from Pompeii reveals that victims of Vesuvius\u2019s eruption have been wrongly identified.",
    "story": [
      "Centuries on and it turns out that long-held assumptions about some of the people of Pompeii should not have been set in stone.",
      "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains in the doomed Roman town has revealed that some of the victims of Mount Vesuvius\u2019s eruption in A.D. 79 have been wrongly identified, highlighting how much modern day thinking has been projected onto the ancient world.",
      "\u201cWe show that the individuals\u2019 sexes and family relationships do not match traditional interpretations,\u201d wrote the authors of the research published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cModern assumptions about gendered behaviors may not be reliable lenses through which to view data from the past,\u201d they added.",
      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",
      "But the DNA analysis has shown the person thought to be the mother was actually a man who was unrelated to the child, according to the new research.",
      "And at least one of the people locked in the embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man.",
      "\u201cThe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, professor David Reich, said in interview Thursday with the Harvard Medical School, where he lectures.",
      "Researchers from Italy's University of Florence and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in the German city of Leipzig also took part in the study, which examined 14 casts undergoing restoration in a bid determine the victims\u2019 sex, ancestry and genetic relationships using genetic material preserved for almost 2,000 years.",
      "Their findings also revealed that residents of the seaside resort favored by wealthy Romans had diverse backgrounds, primarily tracing their ancestry to eastern Mediterranean immigrants, highlighting the mobility of people and the multicultural nature of the Roman Empire.",
      "Before the eruption, which lasted for more than 24 hours and had the\u00a0power of thousands\u00a0of nuclear bombs, Mount Vesuvius\u00a0had been mostly dormant for centuries.",
      "An estimated 20,000 people lived in Pompeii at the time and many were consumed by a wave of ash, pumice and mud, freezing them in place beneath a fresh layer of volcanic sediment.",
      "Over the centuries, Pompeii and the dead were forgotten, remaining buried for almost two millennia until a farmer found part of the city beneath a vineyard in 1748.",
      "In the 19th century, archaeologists pioneered the technique of pouring plaster into voids left by decomposed bodies, creating lifelike casts.",
      "Since then, more than 100 of these casts have been produced, capturing the victims' forms along with any surviving bones preserved through the centuries, according to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.",
      "Research at Pompeii continues to reveal new details about the ancient city and its people, with fresh discoveries made all the time.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers were awarded a $700,000 prize for employing artificial intelligence to decipher a 2,000-year-old scroll that had been charred in the eruption.",
      "And last year, excavations revealed people had died as a result of an earthquake as well as the eruption and an opulent house was unveiled two decades after restoration began."

      "Engineers concluded after a preliminary inspection and confirmed the Boeing 737 jet suffered a contained engine failure, the statement added.",
      "\u201cA really jolting shudder went through the plane,\u201d passenger Mark Willacy, a journalist with the Australian broadcaster ABC News, told his network, adding that he heard the loud bang just after the jet pulled up from Sydney Airport.",
      "\u201cWe knew immediately something was wrong,\u201d he added. \u201cThat big bang as the wheels were leaving the ground and the shudder \u2014 that was like nothing I\u2019ve ever felt.\u201d",

      "In a separate statement Sydney Airport said the \u201cdeparture of aircraft coincided with a grass fire along the eastern side of the airport\u2019s parallel runway.\u201d",
      "Firefighters brought this under control, the statement said, adding that it was \u201cnot clear at this stage if the two incidents are linked and investigations are continuing.\u201d",
      "It is unclear if this complicated the flight 520's descent, but the airport said by 5 p.m. local time (1 a.m. ET Friday) it had returned to full operation."

    "story": [
      "China\u2019s new J-35A stealth fighter jet will be displayed for the first time next week at the country\u2019s biggest civil and military airshow, a biennial event where Beijing showcases its expanding aerospace industry.",
      "The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition begins Tuesday in the southern Greater Bay city of Zhuhai. The 2022 edition of the event led to about $40 billion in \u201ccooperation agreements\u201d being signed, according to its organizers.",
      "Developing domestic aerospace design and manufacturing capabilities is a major strategic priority for Beijing as it vies for regional military dominance with the U.S. amid escalating tensions around Taiwan and the South China Sea.",
      "China also seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign imports, a concern borne out after the election as the next U.S. president this week of Donald Trump, who has been vocal about increasing trade tariffs and decoupling supply chains from the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "Alongside drones, weapons systems, aircraft and electronic warfare technologies, China\u2019s emerging role as a commercial airliner manufacturer through state-owned planemaker COMAC will be on display.",
      "As the expected highlight of the show, the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) will reveal to the public the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation\u2019s J-35A, which the air force described last week as a \u201cmedium-sized stealth multi-purpose fighter.\u201d",
      "Russia has also flown its most advanced fighter jet, the SU-57, to Zhuhai for its first airshow abroad, in an apparent message to the West about China-Russia cooperation.",
      "The J-35A, which uses airstrips to take off and land, is a variant of the J-35, a stealthy aircraft China is developing for use on aircraft carriers. Little is known about its performance or capabilities, although it superficially resembles the Lockheed Martin F-35.",
      "The J-35 program is a follow-on from China\u2019s J-31 fighter, which made its public debut at the Zhuhai show in 2014 but was never used by the People\u2019s Liberation Army or sold to foreign customers.",
      "Diplomats and security analysts have closely watched the evolution of J-35 variants given the importance of the plane to China\u2019s aircraft carrier program, which seeks to expand jets\u2019 range and payload to project power beyond China\u2019s home waters.",
      "Monday marks the 75th anniversary of the PLAAF, which will have its largest presence at the airshow, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "This year\u2019s Zhuhai airshow is its first post-pandemic edition since Beijing lifted its zero-Covid policy and travel restrictions in 2023.",
      "Airbus and the world\u2019s third-largest planemaker, Embraer, will have a presence at the show, but Boeing will not be officially represented after new CEO Kelly Ortberg halted travel to industry events as the troubled U.S. manufacturer recovers from a damaging seven-week workers\u2019 strike that ended this week.",
      "Beijing has invested heavily in developing homegrown commercial planes, and engines that one day may replace the foreign versions that currently power COMAC\u2019s jets.",
      "COMAC-watchers will, in particular, be paying attention to a possible rebranding of the company\u2019s ARJ21 regional jet, after one was spotted by aviation enthusiasts in mid-October at a Chinese airport with C909 painted on its blue tail, instead of ARJ21.",
      "Although largely symbolic, the change \u2014 which would align with the manufacturer\u2019s naming convention for its other models \u2014 signals Beijing\u2019s growing intention to present itself as a full-scale alternative to Airbus and Boeing, which are both struggling to keep up with demand.",
      "Industry sources say COMAC is a long way off from making inroads internationally without benchmark certifications from the E.U. \u2014 which COMAC is pursuing for its C919 airliner \u2014 or the U.S.",
      "In particular, competing with Western engines poses one of the most daunting challenges for China\u2019s rising aerospace industry, even after a spate of industrial problems in the West.",
      "Even so, Chinese manufacturers will benefit from the sheer scale of their domestic market, analysts say. China is the world\u2019s second-largest domestic aviation market after the U.S.",
      "Boeing has said China will more than double its commercial airplane fleet and need 8,830 new planes by 2043."
