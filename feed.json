      "LAS VEGAS -- The attorneys for the man accused of killing rap icon Tupac Shakur in 1996 are pushing to suppress evidence obtained in what they claim was an \u201cunlawful nighttime search.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas criminal defense attorneys Robert Draskovich and William Brown filed a motion this week on behalf of their client, Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, who was charged in the drive-by shooting of the iconic rapper off the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "Davis' attorneys argue a judge relied on a \u201cmisleading portrait\u201d of Davis as a dangerous drug dealer to grant the execution of a search warrant at night, which should only be done in exceptional circumstances, such as if there\u2019s a risk that evidence will disappear if officers wait until morning.",
      "In reality, Davis, an ex- gang leader from Southern California, had left the narcotics trade in 2008 and began doing inspection work for oil refineries, his attorneys say. He was a 60-year-old retired cancer survivor with adult children and grandchildren and had been living with his wife in Henderson, a city outside of Las Vegas, for nine years at the time the warrant was executed.",
      "\u201cThe court wasn\u2019t told any of this,\u201d his attorneys wrote in the motion. \u201cAs a result, the court authorized a nighttime search based on a portrait of Davis that bore little resemblance to reality \u2014 a clearly erroneous factual determination, in other words.\u201d",
      "The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 which conducted the search and collected Davis' electronic devices, \u201cpurported marijuana\u201d and tubs of photographs \u2014 declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation. At the time of the search, police said executing the warrant under the cover of darkness would allow officers to surround and secure the residence, and that if Davis barricaded himself, the darkness would allow officers to evacuate the surrounding homes with the least exposure to residents.",

They say he has never offered details that would firmly corroborate his presence in the car, and that he benefited from saying he was present.

      "Her name, with its alliterative cadence, became synonymous with a kind of classic beauty. In songs, Bardot is often not Bardot the woman, but a symbol for desire \u2014 shorthand for a bombshell. Decades removed from the peak of her screen fame, contemporary performers continue to sing her name despite her many controversies, including being convicted five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred and provocative comments about the #MeToo movement.",

I said my friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,\u201d he sings. \u201cAnita Ekberg / Sophia Loren / Country\u2019ll grow.\u201d",
      "The Brazilian artist Caetano Veloso composed the protest song at the beginning of the tropicalismo movement; it became a hallmark of his career and one of the best-known Brazilian songs of all time.

      "A central architect of French pop, singer Serge Gainsbourg wrote this duet for himself and Bardot. It's styled after a poem the outlaw Bonnie Parker wrote, titled \u201cThe Trail\u2019s End,\u201d shortly before she and partner Clyde Barrow were killed.",

      "The Pretenders know a little something about the social power of Bardot. The English rock band's principal songwriter and frontperson Chrissie Hynde sings: \u201cWhen love walks in the room / Everybody stand up / Oh, it\u2019s good, good, good / Like Brigitte Bardot.\u201d",

      "French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot has died at age 91",
      "PARIS -- Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.",
      "Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. Speaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death, and said that no arrangements had been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month.",
      "Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman.\u201d Directed by then husband Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.",
      "At the height of a cinema career that spanned more than two dozen films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France\u2019s best-known stars, even as she struggled with depression.",
      "Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \u201cMarianne,\u201d the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal. Bardot\u2019s face appeared on statues, postage stamps and coins.",
      "\u2018\u2019We are mourning a legend,'' French President Emmanuel Macron said in an X post.",
      "Bardot\u2019s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She traveled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals. She also condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.",
      "\u201cMan is an insatiable predator,\u201d Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\u201d",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots\u2019 respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest recognition.",
      "Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.",
      "She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.",
      "Bardot\u2019s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d\u2019Ormale, a onetime adviser to far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist with multiple racism convictions of his own, as a \u201clovely, intelligent man.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she supported the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \u201cexceptional woman\u201d who was \u201cincredibly French.\u201d",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass.\u201d",
      "Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born Sept. 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.",
      "Bardot once described her childhood as \u201cdifficult\u201d and said that her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.",
      "Vadim, a French movie produce who she married in 1952, saw her potential and wrote \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.",
      "The film, which portrayed Bardot as a teen who marries to escape an orphanage and then beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\u201d Bardot said of her early films. \u201cI suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\u201d",

      "Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant media attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas. Photographers had broken into her house two weeks before she gave birth to snap a picture of her pregnant.",
      "Nicolas\u2019 father was Jacques Charrier, a French actor who she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.",
      "\u201cI was looking for roots then,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI had none to offer.\u201d",
      "In her 1996 autobiography \u201cInitiales B.B.,\u201d she likened her pregnancy to \u201ca tumor growing inside me,\u201d and described Charrier as \u201ctemperamental and abusive.\u201d",
      "Bardot married her third husband, West German millionaire playboy Gunther Sachs, in 1966, and they divorced three years later.",
      "Among her films were \u201cA Parisian\u201d (1957); \u201cIn Case of Misfortune,\u201d in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960); \u201cPrivate Life\u201d (1962); \u201cA Ravishing Idiot\u201d (1964); \u201cShalako\u201d (1968); \u201cWomen\u201d (1969); \u201cThe Bear And The Doll\u201d (1970); \u201cRum Boulevard\u201d (1971); and \u201cDon Juan\u201d (1973).",
      "With the exception of 1963\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cContempt,\u201d directed by Godard, Bardot\u2019s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.",
      "\u201cIt was never a great passion of mine,\u201d she said of filmmaking. \u201cAnd it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn (Monroe) perished because of it.\u201d",

      "She emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking. She abandoned her jet-set life and sold off movie memorabilia and jewelry to create a foundation devoted exclusively to the prevention of animal cruelty.",
      "Depression sometimes dogged her, and she said that she attempted suicide again on her 49th birthday.",
      "Her activism knew no borders. She urged South Korea to ban the sale of dog meat and once wrote to U.S. President Bill Clinton asking why the U.S. Navy recaptured two dolphins it had released into the wild.",
      "She attacked centuries-old French and Italian sporting traditions including the Palio, a free-for-all horse race, and campaigned on behalf of wolves, rabbits, kittens and turtle doves.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... my distress takes over,\u201d Bardot told the AP when asked about her racial hatred convictions and opposition to Muslim ritual slaughter,",
      "In 1997, several towns removed Bardot-inspired statues of Marianne after the actress voiced anti-immigrant sentiment. Also that year, she received death threats after calling for a ban on the sale of horse meat.",
      "Environmental campaigner Paul Watson, who was beaten on a seal hunt protest in Canada alongside Bardot in 1977 and campaigned with her for five decades, acknowledged that \u201cmany disagreed with Brigitte\u2019s politics or some of her views.\u201d",

      "Grigorian is to sing eight \u201cCarmen\u201d performances starting July 26 in a new production by Gabriela Carrizo with Jonathan Tetelman as Don Jos\u00e9, Kristina Mkhitaryan as Mica\u00ebla, with Teodor Currentzis conducting the Utopia Orchestra.",
      "\u201cI would not bet against her,\u201d Metropolitan Opera's general manager Peter Gelb said. \u201cShe\u2019s very much of a kind of old-school singer. She\u2019s kind of fearless when it comes to taking on new repertoire.\u201d",

      "Hollywood has wrapped up a turbulent 2025 with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and \u201cMarty Supreme.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood wrapped up a turbulent year with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a box-office hit for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet with \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d over a busy holiday weekend in movie theaters.",
      "As expected, James Cameron\u2019s latest trip to Pandora dominated ticket sales, collecting $88 million over the four-day Christmas-to-Sunday period and $64 million on the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though \u201cFire and Ash\u201d initially opened notably softer domestically than its 2022 predecessor, \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d it held better in its second weekend. It dipped just 28%, whereas \u201cWay of Water\u201d fell 53%.",
      "In two weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has quickly amassed $217.7 million in North America for The Walt Disney Company. But the $400 million-budgeted film has been a massive draw internationally, grossing $542.7 million thus far overseas. To reach the box-office heights of the previous films, both of which rank among the biggest blockbusters ever, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will need to sustain business through New Year\u2019s and early January. If it does, \u201cAvatar\u201d could become the first franchise with three $2 billion movies.",
      "But much of the heat in theaters over Christmas and on the weekend belonged to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d A24\u2019s biggest budget release, Josh Safdie\u2019s 1950s-set table tennis drama collected $27.1 million over the four-day weekend, a smash success for the indie studio.",
      "Chalamet went to great lengths to promote the acclaimed release, including appearing atop the Sphere in Las Vegas. The strong opening proved that the 30-year-old star has drawing power beyond most of his contemporaries, and it marked a rare box-office win for a wholly original film. Safdie\u2019s film carries a price tag of about $70 million.",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d even bested the film most analysts expected to rank number two: Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cAnaconda.\u201d The big-screen comedy, starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, collected $23.7 million over the four-day holiday weekend. That\u2019s still good for comedy, a genre most studios have abandoned in recent years. But \u201cAnaconda\u201d (50% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) was surely dinged by poor reviews.",
      "Hollywood is ending the year with its best Christmas Day box office since before the COVID-19 pandemic, a celebratory final note in what\u2019s been a rough year for the film industry. Going into the year, expectations were high for the industry\u2019s first year this decade not marred by pandemic or strike.",
      "\u201cIt was a really solid end to a tumultuous year,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt's been a roller-coaster ride. I think the best news for the industry \u2014 I know we kind of say this every year \u2014 but if you look at the lineup for 2026, it's pretty incredible.\u201d",
      "But domestic ticket sales on the year are ending roughly on par with the disappointing $8.75 billion in 2024. With three days left in 2025, the box-office total is $8.76 billion, according to Comscore. By comparison, in 2019, that total was $11.4 billion.",
      "That\u2019s a worrying development for theaters, which are now nervously watching Netflix attempt to buy one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied studios in Warner Bros. The highest grossing film of the year was a Chinese production, the $2 billion-generating \u201cNe Zha 2.\u201d The most-watched movie of 2025 was \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d a movie Sony Pictures sold to Netflix.

      "The Trump administration has announced the initial disbursement from its $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program",
      "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "But while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.",
      "Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "\u201cThis fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.",
      "Under the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state\u2019s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state\u2019s population.",
      "The formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.",
      "Several Republican-led states \u2014 including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.",
      "The money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to \u201cclaw back\u201d funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.",
      "\u201cI've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she\u2019s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.",

Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has been critical of many of the administration\u2019s policies but voted for the budget bill that slashed Medicaid, pointed to the fund when recently questioned about how the cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that\u2019s struggling,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cThis money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.\u201d",
      "But experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.",
      "Estimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP\u2019s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",
      "\u201cWhen you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know \u2014 that math does not add up,\u201d Cochran-McClain said.",
      "She also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state\u2019s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.",
      "And even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress\u2019 Medicaid cuts.",
      "\u201cWe talk to rural providers every day that say, \u2018I would really love to do x, y, z, but I\u2019m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo when you\u2019re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.\u201d",

Experts say that keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",

      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Nina, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\u201d of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe science is increasingly clear.\u201d",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area\u2019s population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\u201d Otto said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources, what the scientists call \u201climits of adaptation.\u201d The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",

Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\u201cThe geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \u201cAnd we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\u201d",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex.

Same goes for low-fat yogurts \u201cmade with real fruit,\u201d organic plant-based milks and bottled \u201csuperfood\u201d smoothies.",
      "Buyer beware: Healthy grocery buzzwords like those often cover up an unhealthy amount of sugar.",
      "Added sugars are difficult to quickly spot because many companies use clever marketing to distract consumers, said Nicole Avena, a professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at Mount Sinai Medical School and Princeton University who has studied added sugars.",
      "Avena said while some health-forward brands know people are starting to become aware of the hazards of added sugars, \"a lot of the bigger brands don\u2019t worry so much about people\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s how to spot hidden sugars and what to do about it.",
      "Along with saturated fat and salt, eating excess sugar is linked to heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other health risks.",
      "The average American consumes 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, which adds up to 57 pounds (26 kilograms) per year, according to the American Heart Association. About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.",
      "To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.",

      "But that might be too flexible, Popp said.",
      "\u201cI would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,\u201d he said.",

She said research shows that sweet flavors are what activate the reward center of the brain, not the sugar itself.",

      "But for the general public, minimizing dependence on the overall sweetness of food is key to improving health, she said.",

That communist government has ruled the rest of China ever since.",

      "Chinese President Xi Jinping also weighed in Wednesday, albeit obliquely, making a brief reference to the Taiwan situation in an annual New Year\u2019s Eve speech to the nation. He said Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share \u201ca bond of blood and kinship.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable,\u201d Xi said.",

      "It has some targets in mind in that respect. In November, the prime minister of Japan \u2014 a nation that has a bumpy history with China after brutally colonizing parts of it in the early 20th century \u2014 said she wouldn't rule out military intervention if Taiwan faced direct attack by the PLA.",

      "Japan is accelerating a military buildup program designed to double annual arms spending",
      "TOKYO -- Japan is barreling forward with efforts to significantly boost its military capabilities to stand up to China\u2019s growing threats by doubling annual arms spending. The goal comes as Tokyo\u2019s main ally, the United States, pushes for more military assistance in Asia and a military hawk and ultra-conservative takes over Japan's leadership.",
      "Japan says it is still a peaceful nation and the buildup is necessary for a more self-reliant military that can better deter China. But Beijing and other critics see Japan as deviating from its postwar peace pledge, pointing to Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement soon after taking office that any Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response.",
      "Japan\u2019s transformation into one of the world\u2019s major defense spenders has developed over decades and raises the question of whether the ongoing buildup is a violation of its pacifist constitution.",
      "Here is a closer look.",
      "After World War II, Japan was not supposed to have a military.",
      "During the 1945-1952 U.S. occupation, American officials wanted to stamp out the militarism that led to Japanese aggression across Asia before and during the war.",
      "Under Article 9 of the U.S.-drafted 1947 constitution, Japan renounced the use of force to settle international disputes, and the right to maintain land, sea and air forces for that purpose.",
      "The U.S. changed its mind about Japanese militarism when the Korean War started in 1950. Japan became an ally, not a threat, leading to the creation of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in 1954. Article 9 is now widely seen as the legal basis for Japan to have a sufficient military to defend itself.",
      "Japan has since repeatedly stretched the definition of self-defense, allowing overseas dispatches of its troops as part of international peacekeeping operations, though mostly avoiding combat missions.",
      "A big change came in 2014, under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wanted Japan to have a normal military. Abe newly interpreted Article 9 as legalizing collective defense. The following year, a security law allowed Japan to use force if the United States or other friendly nations come under enemy attack, even if Japan is not being attacked.",
      "This was Abe\u2019s attempt to have a normal military without formally changing the constitution.",
      "Takaichi angered China by giving a hypothetical example of such a situation, a deviation from former leaders\u2019 strategic ambiguity.",
      "The flap with Beijing escalated in December when Chinese aircraft locked their radars, considered possible preparation for firing missiles, on Japanese planes during Chinese aircraft carrier drills near southwestern Japan.",
      "Two Chinese aircraft carriers also were spotted in June operating near the southern Japanese island of Iwo Jima for the first time. This led to worry in Tokyo about Beijing\u2019s rapidly expanding military activity far beyond its borders and in areas around islands claimed by both countries.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s Cabinet last week approved a record defense budget plan. It exceeds 9 trillion yen ($58 billion) for the coming year and aims to fortify its strike-back capability and coastal defense with cruise missiles and unmanned arsenals.",
      "In Beijing later that day, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the Takaichi government for accelerating the pace of its military buildup and expansion, and added: \u201cJapan is deviating from the path of peaceful development it has long claimed to uphold and is moving further and further in a dangerous direction.\u201d",

Victims of Japanese aggression, especially China and the Koreas, see visits to the shrine as tantamount to a lack of remorse about Japan\u2019s wartime past.",
      "Takaichi stayed away from Yasukuni in 2025 and sent a religious ornament marking the Aug. 15 anniversary of Japan\u2019s defeat as a personal gesture instead of praying at the shrine.",
      "A fundamental change came in December 2022 when former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s government adopted a security strategy stating the need for Japan to acquire strike-back capability with long-range missiles, a major break from Japan\u2019s self-defense-only policy.",
      "The strategy names China as Japan\u2019s biggest strategic challenge and calls for a more offensive role for Japanese troops under its security alliance with the U.S as the allies work more closely together.",
      "Masahiro Sakata, former head of the Cabinet Legislative Bureau, described the move as \u201cthe death of Article 9.\u201d",
      "After the war, Japan long prioritized economic development over defense while relying largely on the U.S. by hosting about 50,000 American troops who also serve the region.",
      "Japan maintained a defense spending cap of 1% of GDP until the annual defense budget started to rise under Abe\u2019s nearly decade-long leadership, to about 1.1%. Takaichi is certain to achieve a 2% target by March, two years earlier than planned, and is expected to push for more spending in coming years as Japan is under growing pressure after NATO adopted a new target of 5%.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s revised security and defense policy would aim to further bolster Japan with unmanned combative weapons and long-range missiles. It is expected to scrap remaining restrictions on arms exports to promote the development of Japan\u2019s defense industry and cooperation with friendly nations.",
      "Japan has long banned arms exports but has significantly eased restrictions in recent years and is now developing next-generation fighter jets with the UK and Italy while finalizing a deal to sell frigates to Australia. Japan also will to provide support for construction and maintenance for U.S. warships.",

      "Southern Hungary landowner Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti has been battling severe drought on his land",
      "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary -- Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much worse, and it\u2019s getting worse year after year,\u201d he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. \u201dWhere did so much water go? It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Nagyap\u00e1ti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.",
      "The region, known as the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g, has been described by some studies as semiarid \u2014 a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback \u2014 and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.",
      "In a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited \u201cthe combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management\u201d as causes for the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.",
      "Fields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.",
      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",

      "At 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.",
      "Ash, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.",
      "At a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it\u2019s still working. They download its data and rebury it.",
      "A \u201cvolcanic bomb,\u201d a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.",
      "A bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo\u2019s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.",
      "Digging up one of the last seismic stations, Cal\u00f2\u2019s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines\u2019 wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.",
      "The project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.",
      "But Cal\u00f2 says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side \u2014 where there is more accumulated magma \u2014 and what implications that could have.",
      "This was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano\u2019s interior is published. Watching the volcano\u2019s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, the master's student, said.",

      "Zia had faced corruption cases she said were politically motivated, but in January 2025 the Supreme Court acquitted Zia in the last corruption case against her, which would have let her run in February\u2019s general election.",

He was credited with opening democracy in the country but was killed in a 1981 military coup.

Zia\u2019s government lasted only 12 days before a nonpartisan caretaker government was installed and the new election was held that June.",

      "Zia\u2019s Bangladesh Nationalist Party was previously closely allied with the party and her government maintained the confidence of the business community by following pro-investment, open market policies. Zia was known to have a soft spot for Pakistan and used to deliver anti-Indian political speeches. India alleged insurgents were allowed to use Bangladesh\u2019s soil to destabilize India\u2019s northeastern states under Zia, especially during her term from 2001-2006.",

      "China was ruled by the Kuomintang, or Nationalists, from 1927 to 1949. When civil war broke out, and Mao Zedong\u2019s communists overthrew the Nationalists, they fled to Taiwan, off the coast of southern China.",

Taiwan\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration was notified that seven temporary \u201cdangerous zones\u201d had been set up around the strait. The schedules of Taiwan\u2019s four international airports on Tuesday afternoon showed over 150 international and domestic flights had revised times, delays or cancellations.",

      "The PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command sent destroyers, frigates, fighters and bombers to the waters to the north and south of the island to test its ability in sea-air coordination and blockading. Its ground forces carried out long-range, live-fire drills in the waters to the island\u2019s north. They also organized live-fire training alongside simulated long-range joint strike with air, navy and missiles units, in the waters to Taiwan\u2019s south, achieving what command spokesperson Li Xi called \u201cdesired effects.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday commuted to Cheong Wa Dae, the country\u2019s traditional presidential palace, for the first time since taking office in June, more than three years after his ousted predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol moved the presidential office to the Defense Ministry compound.",
      "It was the first time a president had commuted to Cheong Wa Dae since May 9, 2022, the final day of former President Moon Jae-in\u2019s term, before Yoon began his presidency working out of a converted Defense Ministry building. Following the relocation, Yoon opened parts of Cheong Wa Dae to the public as a tourist site, which drew millions of visitors.",
      "Lee, who won a snap presidential election in June following Yoon\u2019s removal over a brief declaration of martial law in December 2024, spent weeks relocating the presidential office back to Cheong Wa Dae, also known as the Blue House, as he seeks to erase the legacy of his now-jailed predecessor.",
      "Cheong Wa Dae is nestled on the lower slopes of a mountain in northern Seoul, occupying about 250,000 square meters (62 acres) behind the historic Gyeongbokgung Palace. The site, which has undergone several renovations over the decades, has served primarily as the country\u2019s presidential office since the government\u2019s founding following independence from Japanese colonial rule at the end of World War II.",
      "Ahead of Lee\u2019s commute, officials raised a presidential flag featuring two phoenixes at Cheong Wa Dae at midnight, marking the palace\u2019s return as the official presidential office.

      "Yoon, a staunch conservative, later triggered the country\u2019s deepest democratic crisis in decades when he declared martial law on Dec. 3, 2024, during a standoff with Lee\u2019s liberal Democratic Party, which controlled the legislature and obstructed much of his policy agenda.",
      "Martial law lasted only hours, after a quorum of lawmakers broke through a military blockade and voted to lift the measure. Yoon was impeached later that month, removed from office in April by a Constitutional Court ruling and re-arrested in July. He now faces serious criminal charges, including rebellion, which carries a possible life sentence or the death penalty.",

      "Bulgaria is joining the euro on New Year's Day",
      "SOFIA, Bulgaria -- On New Year\u2019s Day, Bulgaria becomes the 21st country to join the euro currency union, furthering its integration into the European Union. But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises.",
      "Supporters of switching to the euro from the old currency, the lev, are praising the move as one of the greatest achievements since the 1989 transition from a Soviet-style economy to democracy and free markets. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe.",
      "But many people are uneasy, in a country where corruption is rife and trust in the authorities is low. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%.",
      "An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The margin of error was about plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the March poll.",
      "The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election \u2014 the eighth in five years \u2014 is expected to be held next spring.",
      "Nevelin Petrov, 64, said he welcomed the euro. \u201cBulgaria is a full member of the European Union, and its rightful place is alongside the other developed and democratic European nations,\u201d he said. \u201cI am convinced that the adoption of the euro will contribute to the long-term prosperity of our country,\u201d he said.",
      "Others, like Darina Vitova, who runs a pedicure salon in Sofia, said things were moving too fast although she welcomed the change \u201cin principle.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe standard of living and incomes in our country are far from those in the richest European countries, while prices here are rising and life for the average person will become more difficult,\u201d she said. She acknowledges that when heading to the beaches in neighboring Greece, it will be more convenient to pay with the same \u201cpocket money\u201d she uses at home.",
      "Bulgaria, with its 6.4 million people, is one of the poorest members of the 27-country European union. The average monthly wage is 1,300 euros ($1,530).",
      "Countries that join the EU commit to the euro, but actually joining can take years and some members are in no hurry. Poland in particular has seen strong economic growth since joining the EU in 2004 without adopting the euro.",
      "Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. Nationalist and pro-Russian groups exploit these fears.",
      "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining. Price rises can be more apparent than real, as cafe and hairdressers may put off printing new menus and price lists ahead of the change, so that increases are only delayed, not caused by the euro.",

      "HONG KONG -- State-backed property developer China Vanke, once the country\u2019s largest homebuilder by sales, narrowly avoided defaulting on a 2 billion yuan ($284 million) bond last week as the painfully slow recovery in China\u2019s property market drags on.",
      "The Chinese developer also was seeking to delay repayment of another 3.7 billion yuan ($530 million) of onshore debt due on Dec. 28, with bondholders agreeing to extend the deadline to February.",
      "Years after the downturn in the housing market began, Chinese developers are still struggling to regain their footing, despite a slew of government policies meant to revive the industry. Weak investment and housing prices have shaken investor confidence, spilling into the broader economy since millions of homeowners are stuck with apartments worth far less than what they paid for them.",
      "Instead of the huge driver of prosperity that it once was, the property market is weighing on the economy.",
      "Although Vanke's bondholders have approved extensions for repayments of its debt, the risk of a default remains.",
      "About a third-owned by Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned railway, publicly listed Vanke's finances are a mess. Its revenue fell 27% from a year earlier in the latest July-September quarter, and several of its onshore bonds were suspended from trading after prices plunged.",
      "The developer owes more than $50 billion, less than the more than $300 billion in debt racked up by China Evergrande, one of the first property dominos to fall when it defaulted in 2021 after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing in the industry.",
      "Analysts say Vanke, founded in the 1980s in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, may be testing the limits of state support for property developers in reviving the industry, which once accounted for more than a quarter of total economic activities in China.",
      "More than four years after the downturn began, China\u2019s property sector has yet to recover. The situation varies from city to city, but overall home prices have fallen by 20% or more from their peak in 2021.",
      "The decline has continued, with new home sales falling 11.2% by value year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2025, according to official statistics. Property investments fell nearly 16% from a year earlier.",
      "The slump has caused massive layoffs, hurting overall consumer confidence and spending.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year's crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.",
      "Soybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump's massive budget bill take effect later this year.",
      "Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.",
      "But farmers say the aid won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.",

      "After Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February, but so far China has only purchased about 4.3 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA figures.",

      "The aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.",
      "The USDA said it would use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. The USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.",

      "By most measures, 2025 was a rough year for those who care about freedom of the press",
      "NEW YORK -- By nearly any measure, 2025 has been a rough year for anyone concerned about freedom of the press.",
      "It's likely to be the deadliest year on record for journalists and media workers. The number of assaults on reporters in the U.S. nearly equals the last three years combined. The president of the United States berates many who ask him questions, calling one woman \u201cpiggy.\u201d And the ranks of those doing the job continues to thin.",
      "It's hard to think of a darker time for journalists. So say many, including Tim Richardson, a former Washington Post reporter and now program director for journalism and disinformation at PEN America. \u201cIt's safe to say this assault on the press over the past year has probably been the most aggressive that we've seen in modern times.\u201d",
      "Worldwide, the 126 media industry people killed in 2025 by early December matched the number of deaths in all of 2024, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and last year was a record-setter. Israel's bombing of Gaza accounted for 85 of those deaths, 82 of them Palestinians.",
      "\u201cIt's extremely concerning,\u201d said Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists. \u201cUnfortunately, it's not just, of course, about the sheer numbers of journalists and media workers killed, it's also about the failure to obtain justice or get accountability for those killings.",
      "\u201cWhat we know from decades of doing this work is that impunity breeds impunity,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a failure to tackle journalists' killings creates an environment where those killings continue.\u201d",
      "The committee estimates there are at least 323 journalists imprisoned worldwide.",
      "None of those killed this year were from the United States. But the work on American soil has still been dangerous. There have been 170 reports of assaults on journalists in the United States this year, 160 of them at the hands of law enforcement, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. Many of those reports came from coverage of immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "It's impossible to look past the influence of President Donald Trump, who frequently seethes with anger at the press while simultaneously interacting with journalists more than any president in memory \u2014 frequently answering their cellphone calls.",
      "\u201cTrump has always attacked the press,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut during the second term, he's turned that into government action to restrict and punish and intimidate journalists.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press learned that quickly, when Trump limited the outlet's access to cover him after it refused to follow his lead to rename the Gulf of Mexico. It launched a court fight that has remained unresolved. Trump has also extracted settlements from ABC and CBS News in lawsuits over stories that displeased him, and is suing The New York Times and Wall Street Journal.",
      "Long angry about a perceived bias against conservatives on PBS and NPR newscasts, Trump and his allies in Congress successfully cut funding for public broadcasting as a whole. The president has also moved to shut down government-run organizations that beam news to all parts of the world.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is a major investor in media development, in independent media outlets in countries that have little or no independent media, or as a source of information for people in countries where there is no free media,\u201d Ginsberg said. \u201cThe evisceration of Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America is another blow to press freedom globally.\u201d",
      "Others in his administration take Trump's lead, like when his press office chose the day after Thanksgiving to launch a web portal to complain about outlets or journalists being unfair.",

      "\u201cIt's part of this overall strategy that we're seeing from certain governments, notably the United States, to paint all journalists who don't simply (repeat) the narrative put out by the government as fake news, as dubious, as dodgy, as criminal,\u201d Ginsberg said.",
      "Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has portrayed journalists as dark figures skulking around Pentagon halls to uncover classified secrets as his rationale for putting in restrictive rules for coverage.",
      "That's led to the most notable example of journalists fighting back: most mainstream news outlets gave up their credentials to work in the Pentagon rather than agree to these rules, and are still breaking stories while working off-site. The New York Times has sued to overturn the rules. The newspaper also publicly defends itself when attacked by the president, such as when he complained about its coverage of his health.",
      "Despite the more organized effort against the press, the public has taken little notice. The Pew Research Center said that 36% of Americans reported earlier this year hearing about the Trump administration's relationship with the press, compared to 72% who said that at the same point in his first term.",
      "Polls consistently show that journalists have never been popular, and are likely to elicit little sympathy when their work becomes harder.",
      "\u201cReally, the harm falls on the public with so much of this because the public depends on this independent reporting to understand and scrutinize the decisions that are being made by the most powerful office in the world,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "The news industry as a whole is more than two decades in to a retrenchment caused largely by a collapse in the advertising market, and every year brings more reports of journalists laid off as a result. One of the year's most sobering statistics came in a report by the organizations Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News: in 2002, there were 40 journalists for every 100,000 people in the United States and by this year, it was down to just over eight.",
      "Asked if they could find reasons for optimism, both Ginsberg and Richardson pointed to the rise of some independent local news organizations, shoots of growth in a barren landscape, places like the Baltimore Banner, Charlottesville Tomorrow in Virginia and Outlier Media in Michigan.",
      "As much as they are derided in Trump's America, influential Axios CEO Jim VandeHei noted in a column recently that reporters at mainstream media outlets are still working hard and able to set the nation's agenda with their reporting.",
      "As he told the AP: \u201cOver time, people will hopefully come to their senses and say, 'Hey, the media like anything else is imperfect but, man, it's a nice thing to have a free press.'\u201d",

      "California has announced plans to delay the revocation of 17,000 commercial driver\u2019s licenses until March, but Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state could lose $160 million if it does that",
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\u201cCalifornia does NOT have an \u2018extension\u2019 to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\u201d Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they are working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they have put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\u201cCommercial drivers are an important part of our economy \u2014 our supply chains don\u2019t move, and our communities don\u2019t stay connected without them,\u201d said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",

      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver\u2019s work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can\u2019t speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver\u2019s license schools.",

      "Betty Boop and \u201cBlondie\u201d are among the highlights of titles entering the public domain with the arrival of 2026",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Betty Boop and \u201cBlondie\u201d are joining Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh in the public domain.",
      "The first appearances of the classic cartoon and comic characters are among the pieces of intellectual property whose 95-year U.S. copyright maximum has been reached, putting them in the public domain on Jan. 1. That means creators can use and repurpose them without permission or payment.",
      "The 2026 batch of newly public artistic creations doesn't quite have the sparkle of the recent first entries into the public domain of Mickey or Winnie. But ever since 2019 \u2014 the end of a 20-year IP drought brought on by congressional copyright extensions \u2014 every annual crop has been a bounty for advocates of more work belonging to the public.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big year,\u201d said Jennifer Jenkins, law professor and director of Duke\u2019s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, for whom New Year's Day is celebrated as Public Domain Day. \u201cIt's just the sheer familiarity of all this culture.\u201d",
      "Jenkins said that, collectively, this year's work shows \u201cthe fragility that was between the two wars and the depths of the Great Depression.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at what will enter the public domain on Thursday, based on the research of Jenkins and her center.",
      "Betty Boop began as a dog. Seriously.",
      "When she first appears in the 1930 short \u201cDizzy Dishes,\u201d one of four of her cartoons entering the public domain, she's already totally recognizable as the Jazz Age flapper later memorialized in countless tattoos, T-shirts and bumper stickers. She has her baby face, short hair with groomed curls, flashy eyelashes and miniature mouth. But she's also got dangling poodle ears and a tiny black nose. Those would soon morph into dangling earrings and a tiny white nose.",
      "She started as essentially the Minnie Mouse to a popular anthropomorphic dog named Bimbo, whom she would eventually outshine \u2014 and push aside. She's got a supporting role in \u201cDizzy Dishes,\u201d performing a slinky song-and-dance in a tiny black dress. She's not named, but sings \u201cboop boop, a doop.\u201d",
      "Jenkins suggests this canine Betty Boop could be rich for exploitation in new works, and has a free idea: \u201cShe was bitten by a radioactive dog, that\u2019s why she had this weird backstory,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThis movie needs to be made.\u201d",
      "The character was designed and owned by Fleischer Studios, and the shorts were released by Paramount Pictures. She was based at least in part on singer Helen Kane, known as the \u201cBoop-Oop-a-Doop Girl,\u201d thanks to a hit 1929 song. Kane would lose a lawsuit over Betty Boop's character and use of the phrase. During the proceedings the defense alleged Black singer Esther Lee Jones used similar phrases first.",
      "Artists are now free to use this earliest Boop in films and similar work. But making merch won't be free. In an important distinction often raised by Disney over Mickey Mouse, a character's trademark is distinct from the copyright of works that feature them. The Fleischer Productions trademark of Betty Boop remains intact.",
      "Boops and doops were apparently in the air in 1930. Blondie Boopadoop was, like Betty, a young flapper, and the central character of Chic Young's newspaper comic strip that debuted in 1930. It inspired a film series and radio show, and is still running today in papers that still have comics.",
      "The strip followed her carefree breeze through life with her boyfriend, Dagwood Bumstead. The two would marry (and she would change her name) in 1933, and the strip would become the sandwich-heavy domestic comedy familiar to later readers. Though the strip was meant to be based on a woman's life, Dagwood would in many ways become its breakout star \u2014 a proto- Adam Driver, if you will, as the breakout actor from \u201cGirls.\u201d",
      "Nine new Mickey Mouse cartoons also are becoming public domain, two years after \u201cSteamboat Willie\u201d made the first version of him public property. He's joined this year by his dog Pluto, who, in 1930, was known as Rover. (He would get his long-term moniker the following year.)",

      "Some economists believe that the world\u2019s second largest economy is growing more slowly than official figures suggest, even though China may hit its official 2025 annual growth target of about 5%.

      "South Korea is chasing a coal-free future in efforts to slash carbon emissions, an ambitious goal for the fossil fuel-dependent country",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.",
      "At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country\u2019s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",
      "Experts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world\u2019s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.",
      "But as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country\u2019s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.",
      "Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.",
      "South Korea\u2019s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.",
      "Still, it's unclear how South Korea will \u201cmanage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "South Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.",
      "\u201cAs the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "South Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists\u2019 expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.",
      "\u201cThis range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,\u201d said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.",
      "The South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping \u2018America First\u2019 tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.",
      "As part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.",
      "The agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.",
      "LNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea\u2019s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.",
      "South Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.",

      "Renewable energy generated 7% of South Korea\u2019s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffettthis week.",
      "Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.",
      "Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.",
      "Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.",
      "Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.",
      "The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company\u2019s culture.",
      "Part of Buffett\u2019s sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.",
      "\u201cI think the investment community would likely applaud Greg\u2019s management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,\" Seifert said. \"And if it helps performance, that can\u2019t really be faulted.\u201d",

      "Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.",
      "Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.",
      "Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "But if Abel can\u2019t find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.",
      "Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.",
      "Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.",
      "Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses \u201ccan almost take care of themselves.\" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.",
      "One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.",
      "\u201cAs a long-term shareholder, we aren\u2019t too concerned with Todd\u2019s departure and don\u2019t think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,\" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. \"Todd\u2019s situation is unique. It\u2019s just a reminder that Warren\u2019s pending departure is imminent and they\u2019re preparing for a new phase \u2014 one that we\u2019re still excited to see unfold.\u201d",

      "Nick Suzuki scores a power-play goal in overtime, leading the Montreal Canadiens to a 3-2 comeback win over the Florida Panthers",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Nick Suzuki got a power-play goal 3:24 into overtime, and the Montreal Canadiens rallied from a two-goal deficit in the final five minutes of regulation to stun the Florida Panthers 3-2 on Tuesday night.",
      "Suzuki also scored late in regulation to tie the game for the Canadiens, who improved to 6-1-3 in their last 10 games. Cole Caufield also scored for Montreal.",
      "Brad Marchand and Sam Reinhart scored for Florida, but Marchand was called for roughing 1:27 into overtime \u2014 giving Montreal a 4-on-3 advantage.",
      "The Panthers paid tribute to Marchand's 1,000th career point in a pregame ceremony. Marchand got the milestone point in mid-November, but chose this game \u2014 against Montreal, one of his longtime rivals when he was with Boston and a team coached by one of his idols, Martin St. Louis \u2014 for the formal celebration.",
      "The game was scoreless after two periods, just the 11th such game in the NHL this season and the first for both the Panthers and the Canadiens. And it was the first time a Florida-Montreal matchup saw no goals in the first 40 minutes of action since Feb. 14, 2013 \u2014 a contest that ended up as a 1-0 road win for the Canadiens.",
      "But the final 10 minutes were wild.",
      "Marchand opened the scoring at 10:18 and Reinhart connected with 4:59 left to put Florida up 2-0. Back came Montreal, with Caufield scoring 32 seconds after Reinhart's goal and then Suzuki tying it up with 1:22 remaining.",

    "story": [
      "The NFL is seeing a decline in punts, with the 2025 season on track to set a record for the fewest punts per game",
      "There were three times in the first 59 years of the Super Bowl era that a team went back-to-back regular-season games without punting once.",
      "That total has been matched during the 2025 season as part of a growing trend that has led to punts becoming more and more rare.",
      "The new kickoff rule, the K-balls that have contributed to more long field goals and an increase in fourth-down aggressiveness by coaches have conspired to take the punt out of the game.",
      "With one week remaining, the NFL is poised to set a record for fewest punts per game in any season in league history with the average of 3.54 punts per game for each team the lowest on record.",
      "There are several reasons for the drop in punts, with the main causes being the rule changes on special teams and aggressiveness from coaches.",
      "The average starting field position after kickoffs has increased more than 5 yards from two years ago before the rule changes first implemented in 2024 and tweaked this season led to more returns and moved the touchback spot.",
      "That puts teams closer to scoring position on more possessions which, combined with more big-legged kickers and the K-ball, has flipped punts to field goals.",
      "The 105 attempts from at least 55 yards are the most in NFL history and the 20 tries from at least 60 yards are more than there were for the entire 1990s as kickers have become more skilled and the rule changes allowing teams to prepare kicking balls in advance has added a few yards to each kicker\u2019s range.",
      "The fourth-down revolution that began heating up in 2017 when aggressiveness helped Philadelphia win a Super Bowl has taken off even more. The use of analytics has contributed to teams taking more chances on fourth down than in the past, when conservative coaches often opted for the safer option of a punt.",
      "The 837 attempts on fourth down are already the most in any season in NFL history and the record 462 successful conversions are more than double the total of 223 from the 2017 season.",
      "The 25 times when a team hasn't punted once in a game the past two seasons is one more than the total from the first 18 seasons after the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, including Indianapolis, San Francisco and Green Bay all doing it in back-to-back games.",
      "While not needing to punt is usually a positive sign, the Packers have done it the past two weeks in losses, as well as in a Week 9 loss to Carolina. They are the first team ever to lose three games in a season without punting. Only two teams did it twice: Cincinnati last season and the Chargers in 2021.",
      "No one has benefited more from the NFL\u2019s decision to expand the playoffs than coach Matt LaFleur and the Green Bay Packers.",
      "The Packers will be the seventh seed in the NFC for the third straight season after losing 41-24 to Baltimore on Saturday night, earning a spot that wasn\u2019t available until the NFL added an extra playoff team in each conference in 2020.",
      "So instead of missing the playoffs for a fourth straight season, Green Bay will be playing in the postseason once again. The only other team that has earned the seventh seed more than once is Pittsburgh, which did it in 2021 and 2023.",
      "The seventh seed is 1-9 in the wild-card round, with the Packers the only team to win when they beat Dallas in the 2023 playoffs.",

      "That hasn\u2019t been as rare in recent years, with six of the seven times occuring in the last 25 seasons after it happened only once in the first 27 years of seeding \u2014 when Chicago and Cincinnati both missed the 1989 playoffs.",

      "Southern Hungary landowner Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti has been battling severe drought on his land",
      "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary -- Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much worse, and it\u2019s getting worse year after year,\u201d he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. \u201dWhere did so much water go? It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Nagyap\u00e1ti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.",
      "The region, known as the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g, has been described by some studies as semiarid \u2014 a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback \u2014 and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.",
      "In a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited \u201cthe combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management\u201d as causes for the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.",
      "Fields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.",
      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "Tam\u00e1s T\u00f3th, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention \u201cis simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.\u201d",
      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "The Quadrantid meteor shower peaks Friday night into Saturday morning, according to the American Meteor Society. In dark skies during the peak, skygazers typically see around 25 meteors per hour, but this time they'll likely glimpse less than 10 per hour due to light from Saturday's supermoon.",

      "Scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University have created the first three-dimensional image of the Popocat\u00e9petl volcano's interior",
      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",
      "That changed with Popocat\u00e9petl, a volcano he describes as \u201cmajestic.\u201d",

      "Popocat\u00e9petl\u2019s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it\u2019s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.",
      "Karina Rodr\u00edguez, a 26-year-old master\u2019s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.",
      "Having direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "\u201cWe have a natural laboratory here,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201cvery important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.\u201d",
      "At 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.",
      "Ash, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.",
      "At a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it\u2019s still working. They download its data and rebury it.",
      "A \u201cvolcanic bomb,\u201d a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.",
      "A bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo\u2019s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.",
      "Digging up one of the last seismic stations, Cal\u00f2\u2019s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines\u2019 wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.",
      "The project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.",
      "But Cal\u00f2 says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side \u2014 where there is more accumulated magma \u2014 and what implications that could have.",
      "This was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano\u2019s interior is published. Watching the volcano\u2019s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, the master's student, said.",

    "summary": "Jack Smith told lawmakers he had evidence to convict Trump in both cases, according to a deposition.",
    "story": [
      "Smith provided closed-door testimony to the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his decision to bring charges twice against President Donald Trump -- telling lawmakers in a closed-door deposition earlier this month that his team \"had proof beyond reasonable doubt in both cases\" that Trump was guilty of the charges in the 2020 election interference and classified documents cases.",
      "And Smith fervently denied that there was any political influence behind his decision -- contrary to what the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, who requested the testimony, alleged -- such as pressure from then-President Joe Biden or Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
      "\"No,\" Smith responded continuously.",
      "Just over an hour before the closed testimony on Dec. 17, the Department of Justice sent an email to Smith's lawyers preventing him from discussing the classified documents case, according to the 255-page transcript of the deposition, released Wednesday by the Judiciary Committee along with a video of the hearing.",
      "This meant Smith was unable to answer most questions on that case and the deposition -- intended to ask questions about the alleged weaponization of the DOJ against Trump and his allies -- mainly focused on the 2020 election case instead.",
      "Smith's counsel said the DOJ also refused to send a lawyer to advise Smith on whether his statements were in line with their determination of what he could or could not say regarding the cases, according to the deposition. Smith did say, however, that Trump \"obstructed\" the classified documents investigation \"to conceal his continued retention of those documents.\"",
      "Trump repeatedly denied the allegations in both felony cases, which were unprecedented against an American president, and decried them as part of a \"witch hunt.\" Smith, one of Trump's frequent targets on social media, ultimately dropped the cases after Trump's reelection because he said that he was constitutionally prohibited from prosecuting a sitting president.",
      "Smith asserted in his final report that \"but for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.\"",
      "During the deposition, Smith argued, as he had in the past, that Trump \"President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\"",
      "When asked if Trump was responsible for the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Smith said \"Our view of the evidence was that he caused it and that he exploited it and that it was foreseeable to him.\"",
      "Smith argued that Trump's claims that he won the 2020 election were not protected free speech because they were intended to target a government function.",
      "\"There is no historical analog for what President Trump did in this case. As we said in the indictment, he was free to say that he thought he won the election. He was even free to say falsely that he won the election,\" Smith said. \"But what he was not free to do was violate Federal law and use knowing -- knowingly false statements about election fraud to target a lawful government function. That he was not allowed to do. And that differentiates this case from any past history.\"",
      "And Smith said Trump wrote a tweet that \"without question in my mind endangered the life of his own Vice President\" during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.",

Our case was built on, frankly, Republicans who put their allegiance to the country before the party,\" Smith said.",
      "Asked why Smith did not charge any of the alleged co-conspirators, Smith said \"As we stated in the final report, we analyzed the evidence against different co-conspirators. We -- my staff determined that we did have evidence to charge people at a certain point in time. I had not made final determinations about that at the time that President Trump won reelection, meaning that our office was going to be closed down.\"",
      "Smith said he had evidence that Trump ordered the alleged co-conspirators to place phone calls to senators the night of Jan. 6 to try and delay the certification vote.",
      "The committee pressed Smith why he did not speak with Trump allies Steve Bannon, Roger Stone or Peter Navarro as part of their investigation.",
      "\"We pursued the investigative routes that we thought were the most fruitful,\" Smith argued. \"I didn't think it would be fruitful to try to question them.\"",
      "And they pressed him on seizing phones of members of Congress. Smith said only Scott Perry had his phone seized and no senators did.",

      "It's said in some cultures that eating fruit on New Year's Eve brings luck and wealth. Perhaps that's why many cities mix fruit into their celebrations. Miami has its \u201cBig Orange\u201d drop, while Sarasota, Florida, features a pineapple. There are cherry drops in Milwaukie, Oregon, and Traverse City, Michigan. Brightly lit grapes plunge from above in Temecula, California. Atlanta this year is replacing its peach drop with a \u201cdigital drone peach in the sky.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s tough to beat ringing in the year while watching a pair of sparkly flip-flops diving into Folly Beach, South Carolina. In Panama City Beach, Florida, there\u2019s an evening-long bash where 15,000 beach balls are dropped above revelers just hours before a giant beach ball descends a tower at midnight.",
      "What could be better than seeing a 600-pound (272 kilograms) MoonPie make a 60-second descent in Mobile, Alabama? How about getting a slice of MoonPie cake at the city's biggest event of the year? Not sweet enough? Check out the 400-pound (181 kilograms) yellow Peep chick that drops into Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.",
      "Waterfront cities celebrate the sea on New Year's Eve. Brunswick, Georgia, has the shrimp drop, while Easton, Maryland, serves up its annual crab drop. The oyster drop is the main event in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The biggest catch might be in Port Clinton, Ohio, along Lake Erie, home to a 600-pound (272-kilogram) walleye named Wylie. The original papier-mache version debuted 30 years ago and has given way to a menacing fiberglass fish.",
      "There's definitely a food theme to these New Year's drops. Just outside Chicago, watch out for a 10-foot (3 meters) pierogi in Whiting, Indiana. The Idaho Potato Drop in Boise has been going for more than a decade, and Mt. Olive, North Carolina, celebrates its hometown pickle brand by dropping a glittery green pickle that's close to 6 feet (1.8 meters) long.",
      "All of these events are meant to be fun, boost civic pride and attract tourists. But one created such a stir that it ended up in court. Residents in western North Carolina no longer lower a live possum inside a glass box at midnight, calling off the event in 2019 after years of protests and legal challenges. There is still a possum drop in Tallapoosa, Georgia, which was long ago known as Possum Snout. That one, though, stars a stuffed possum named Spencer.",

      "A National Guard deployment in New Orleans authorized by President Donald Trump will begin Tuesday as part of a heavy security presence for New Year\u2019s celebrations",
      "NEW ORLEANS, La. -- A National Guard deployment in New Orleans authorized by President Donald Trump will begin Tuesday as part of a heavy security presence for New Year\u2019s celebrations a year after an attack on revelers on Bourbon Street killed 14 people, officials said Monday.",
      "The deployment in New Orleans follows high-profile National Guard missions the Trump administration launched in other cities this year, including in Washington and Memphis, Tennessee. But the sight of National Guard troops is not unusual in New Orleans, where troops earlier this year also helped bolster security for the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past,\u201d New Orleans police spokesperson Reese Harper said.",
      "The Guard is not the only federal law enforcement agency in the city. Since the start of the month, federal agents have been carrying out an immigration crackdown that has led to the arrest of at least several hundred people.",
      "Harper stressed that the National Guard will not be engaging in immigration enforcement.",
      "\"This is for visibility and just really to keep our citizens safe,\" Harper said. \"It\u2019s just another tool in the toolbox and another layer of security.\u201d",
      "The Guard is expected be confined to the French Quarter area popular with tourists and won't be engaging in assisting in immigration enforcement, Harper said. Guardsmen will operate similar to earlier this year when they patrolled the area around Bourbon Street  following the vehicle-ramming attack on Jan. 1.",
      "The 350 Guard members will stay through Carnival season, when residents and tourists descend on the Big Easy to partake in costumed celebrations and massive parades before ending with Mardi Gras in mid-February.",
      "Louisiana National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Noel Collins said in a written statement that the Guard will support local, state, and federal law enforcement \u201cto enhance capabilities, stabilize the environment, assist in reducing crime, and restoring public trust.\u201d",

      "In total, more than 800 local, state and federal law enforcement officials will be deployed in New Orleans to close off Bourbon Street to vehicular traffic, patrol the area, conduct bag searches and redirect traffic, city officials said during a news conference Monday.",
      "The extra aid for New Orleans has received the support of some Democrats, with Mayor LaToya Cantrell saying she is \"welcoming of those added resources.\u201d",
      "The increased law enforcement presence comes a year after Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove around a police blockade in the early hours of Jan. 1 and raced down Bourbon Street, plowing into people celebrating New Year's Day. The attacker, a U.S. citizen and Army veteran who had proclaimed his support for the Islamic State militant group on social media, was fatally shot by police after crashing. After an expansive search, law enforcement located multiple bombs in coolers placed around the French Quarter. None of the explosive devices detonated.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the attack, 100 National Guard members were sent to the city.",
      "In September, Gov. Jeff Landry asked Trump to send 1,000 troops to Louisiana cities, citing concerns about crime. Democrats pushed back, specifically leaders in New Orleans who said a deployment was unwarranted. They argued that the city has actually seen a dramatic decrease in violent crime rates in recent years.",

At the same time, it started facing a more complicated economic situation, where inflation remained stubbornly high while the job market started slowing.",

    "story": [
      "New Year's Day commemorates the passing of time and the start of a new chapter, so it is fitting that the same day also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into thousands of creative works nearly a century old. As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, are entering the public domain.",
      "They join a growing list of cultural icons that are no longer under copyright protection, including Popeye the Sailor Man and the \"Steamboat Willie\" version of Mickey Mouse.",
      "List of popular intellectual property entering the public domain in 2026",
      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections expire for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are becoming available for free use by anyone:",
      "\"The Murder at the Vicarage\" by Agatha Christie, the first novel featuring elderly amateur detective Miss Marple.\"The Secret of the Old Clock\" by Carolyn Keene, the first appearance of teen detective Nancy Drew, and three follow-ups.\"The Little Engine That Could\" by Watty Piper.Fleischer Studios' \"Dizzy Dishes,\" the first cartoon in which Betty Boop appears.Disney's \"The Chain Gang\" and \"The Picnic,\" both depicting the earliest versions of Mickey's dog Pluto.The initial four months of \"Blondie\" comic strips by Chic Young, featuring the earliest iterations of the titular character and her then-boyfriend, Dagwood.The film \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" directed by Lewis Milestone, Best Picture winner at the 3rd Academy Awards.\"King of Jazz,\" directed by John Murray Anderson, Bing Crosby's first appearance in a feature film.\"Animal Crackers,\" directed by Victor Heerman and starring the Marx Brothers.\"The Big Trail,\" directed by Raoul Walsh, John Wayne's first turn as leading man.\"But Not For Me,\" music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin.\"Georgia on My Mind,\" music by Hoagy Carmichael, lyrics by Stuart Gorrell.\"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt, lyrics by Gus Kahn.\"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,\" music by Al Sherman, lyrics by Al Lewis.Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",

      "Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",
      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Her iconic and provocative looks made her an international sex symbol on movie screens, and the embodiment of Marianne, the national emblem of France, her face replicated on statues, postage stamps and currency. Actress Brigitte Bardot (Sept. 28, 1934-Dec. 28, 2025) was also provocative in her activism, particularly in her support for animal rights.",
      "After studying ballet as a child, Bardot became a model, and acted in several films, before becoming an international sensation in 1956's \"And God Created Woman,\" directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim. The film, in which she played a teenage bride, was considered scandalous for her scenes dancing on tables. Bardot's vibrant, feline sensuality led to the press dubbing her a \"sex kitten.\"",
      "But she resented the limelight, blaming chronic depression and a suicide attempt on the constant media attention after the birth of her only child. When she divorced her second husband, Jacques Charrier, he won custody of their son.",
      "She made two dozen more films in the 1960s, including the Oscar-nominated \"La V\u00e9rit\u00e9,\" Jean-Luc Godard's \"Contempt,\" Louis Malle's \"Viva Maria!,\" \"Babette Goes to War,\" \"A Very Private Affair,\" \"Spirits of the Dead,\" and \"Shalako.\" She also recorded songs with Serge Gainsbourg. Yet, she said filmmaking was \"never a great passion of mine,\" and she turned down roles opposite Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen and Marlon Brando. She retired from acting in 1973; she was just 39.",
      "Bardot's great passion was promoting the rights of animals, creating the Brigitte Bardot Foundation devoted to the prevention of animal cruelty. She shone a light on the slaughter of baby seals, condemned vivisection and bullfights, protested ritualized animal killings in Muslim ceremonies, and called for the end of wearing fur and the sale of horse meat.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told the Associated Press in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "She was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1985.",
      "However, her views later proved more controversial, as she opposed immigration, particularly by Muslims, into France. She shifted her politics during her fourth marriage, to a man who'd advised Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front. Bardot was convicted and fined five times in French courts for inciting racial hatred over her opposition to Muslim religious practices.",
      "Just as controversial were her opinions about actresses protesting sexual harassment in the film industry during the rise of the #MeToo movement, calling such remarks \"hypocritical.\"",
      "Reflecting on the tragic ends that some stars, like Marilyn Monroe, had faced, Bardot wrote in her 2019 book, \"Tears of Battle: An Animal Rights Memoir,\" \"Knowing that we are nothing and that this life is but a short passage, each person should spend his or her existence improving nature and the fate of human and animal beings. \u2026",
      "\"What I rejected the most during my life as an actress was the limelight. That intense focus on my little person ate at me from the inside. Narcissism is contrary to my nature. When I had to go to film premieres, and all of the spotlights were pointed at me, I hated it. Whenever it was time to decide whether or not to go, my manager usually had to kick me in the rear. This worship of celebrity \u2013 a life perpetually centered around myself \u2013 suffocated me. For quite some time, I could not accept this idolatry, the fact that I was known and recognized because of a few films or the new image of the modern woman they were forging. The second part of my life liberated me. My fame could at least be useful for something, my time on Earth could ease some animal suffering. Selfishness is cruel. When we no longer pay attention to anyone, how are we supposed to care about the way we behave toward others?\""

    "summary": "Actor Mario Rodriguez alleged in the lawsuit filed last week in California that Tyler Perry sexually assaulted him during encounters between 2014 and 2019.",
    "story": [
      "Text messages show that Tyler Perry and \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" actor Mario Rodriguez, who recently filed a lawsuit accusing the filmmaker of sexual assault, remained in contact years after Rodriguez alleges their interactions ended.",
      "Rodriguez alleged in the lawsuit filed last week in California that Perry sexually assaulted him during encounters that occurred between 2014 and 2019. The lawsuit says Rodriguez cut off contact with Perry in 2019, though Perry would periodically reach out afterward. But screenshots of text messages obtained by The Associated Press on Sunday night show Rodriguez making contact with Perry as recently as Thanksgiving 2024 and again on Aug. 31, 2025, expressing gratitude, friendship and financial distress.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit seeks at least $77 million in damages and accuses Perry of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Rodriguez also sued Lionsgate, which distributed \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" in 2016, accusing the studio of overlooking Perry's alleged assault.",
      "Perry denied the allegations made in Rodriguez's suit.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Spiro also told the AP: \"I said it before and I will say it again. This is nothing but a $77 million money grab scam.\"",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one text message between Rodriguez and Perry that was sent on Thanksgiving 2024, Rodriguez thanked Perry for helping him through difficult periods in his life and wrote that he appreciated him \"to the moon,\" according to the screenshots. In another series of messages dated Aug. 31 this year, Rodriguez described ongoing health problems, said he lacked health insurance and told Perry he was scared and struggling financially.",
      "The messages were provided to the AP by a source close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Rodriguez has.",
      "The lawsuit follows a separate case filed in June by actor Derek Dixon, who alleged Perry groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit was originally filed in California state court and later moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry is based. Perry also has denied Dixon's allegations.",
      "AP reached out to Rodriguez's attorney, Jonathan Delshad, seeking comment on the text messages, but did not receive a response. Delshad also represents Dixon.",

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0 French politicians were divided on Monday over how to pay tribute to the late Brigitte Bardot who, despite her screen legend, courted controversy \u2014 and convictions \u2014 in later life with her far-right views.",
      "The film star died on Sunday at the age of 91 at home in the south of France. Media around the globe splashed iconic images of her and tributes following the announcement.",
      "Bardot shot to fame in the 1956 film \"And God Created Woman\" and went on to appear in about 50 films, but turned her back on cinema in 1973 to throw herself into fighting for animal rights.",
      "But her links to the far-right stirred controversy.",
      "Bardot was convicted five times for hate speech, mostly about Muslims but also about the inhabitants of the French island of Reunion, whom she described as \"savages.\"",
      "She died before dawn on Sunday morning with her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the far right, by her side.",
      "\"She whispered a word of love to him ... and she was gone,\" Bruno Jacquelin, a representative of her foundation for animals, told BFM television.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron hailed her as a \"legend\" of 20th century cinema who \"embodied a life of freedom.\"",
      "Right-wing politicians laud Bardot",
      "Far-right figures were among the first to mourn her.",
      "Marine le Pen, whose National Rally party is riding high in polls, called her \"incredibly French: free, untameable, whole.\"",
      "Bardot backed Le Pen for president in 2012 and 2017 and described her as a modern \"Joan of Arc\" she hoped could \"save\" France.",
      "Conservative politician Eric Ciotti suggested a national farewell like the one organized for French rock legend Johnny Hallyday.",
      "He launched an online petition that had garnered just over 7,000 signatures Monday.",
      "Left-wing politicians temper praise and some are sharply critical",
      "But few left-wing politicians have spoken about Bardot's passing.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot was a towering figure, a symbol of freedom, rebellion, and passion,\"  Philippe Brun, a senior Socialist party deputy, told Europe 1 radio.",
      "\"We are sad she is gone,\" he said, adding he did not oppose a national homage.",
      "But he did hint at her controversial political views.",
      "\"As for her political commitments, there will be time enough -- in the coming days and weeks -- to talk about them,\" he said.",
      "Communist party leader Fabien Roussel called Bardot a divisive figure.",
      "But \"we all agree French cinema created BB and that she made it shine throughout the world,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau, of the left-leaning Greens Party, was more critical.",
      "\"To be moved by the fate of dolphins but remain indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean -- what level of cynicism is that?\" she quipped on BlueSky.",
      "Bardot's remarks on her funeral raised some eyebrows",
      "Bardot said she wanted to be buried in her garden with a simple wooden cross above her grave -- just like for her animals -- and wanted to avoid \"a crowd of idiots\" at her funeral.",
      "Such a burial is possible in France if local authorities grant permission.",
      "Officials in Saint-Tropez said Monday that Bardot will be buried in a seaside cemetery there, without giving a date.",
      "Born on Sept. 28, 1934 in Paris, Bardot was raised in a well-off traditional Catholic household.",
      "Married four times, she had one child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, with her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.",
      "After quitting the cinema, Bardot withdrew to her home in Saint-Tropez to devote herself to animal rights.",
      "Her calling apparently came when she encountered a goat on the set of her final film, \"The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot.\" To save it from being killed, she bought the animal and kept it in her hotel room.",
      "\"I'm very proud of the first chapter of my life,\" she told AFP in a 2024 interview ahead of her 90th birthday.",
      "\"It gave me fame, and that fame allows me to protect animals -- the only cause that truly matters to me.\"",

      "Martha turned and fled through the crowd, down the wide flight of stone steps, and out into Beaumont Street, looking at nothing but the ground. Three corners later, she found a side road and turned into it. She put her back against the wall and tried to breathe.",
      "She had known there would be ghosts in Oxford. She wasn't afraid of any headless horsemen or nuns haunting the local ruins; it was Charlie, always Charlie she was afraid would find her. There had been times in the first year after her sister's disappearance when Martha's heart would stop as she spotted her through the crowd: the long blond hair, the shapeless cardigan draped over a thin cotton dress. She'd hear a laugh, throaty and sudden, or catch a movement, a walk, a twist in the shoulders, and she'd be certain. Just for a moment. Then the illusion would shatter, and the person she knew to be her sister would resolve into a stranger.",
      "As the years passed, so the ghost of Charlie aged. Now it was women in their midthirties who made Martha stop dead in the streets. In Berlin, once a month perhaps, she'd felt that same flickering certainty before realizing the woman with a child on her lap as she drank a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 was not her sister, just an echo of Martha's own image of who Charlie might be now, thirteen years after fleeing Oxford and her family.",
      "Martha pressed her palm against the wall behind her. She reminded herself of her therapist's mantra for the moments when she was in danger of being overwhelmed. What can you see now? The shiny cobbles of the side street, the white brick of the wall opposite. What can you feel? The bricks under my fingers, a breeze ruffling my hair. What can you smell? Cooking oil, the Black Opium perfume I put on this morning.",
      "Her breathing slowed.",
      "She pulled the letter out of her bag again and stared at it. Could it be from Charlie? Impossible. What could this Chorus know? Should she burn it? Throw it in the river? Take it to the police?",
      "Ah, the police. She heard the scrape of her mother's chair on the kitchen floor as she leaped up at the sound of the doorbell. They had found Charlie's bike not far from the ring road. Did she hitchhike? How was her PhD going? Martha couldn't remember their faces, just their hands around tea mugs as they sat at the table, the low rumble of their voices as they talked about stress and pressure. Most runaways come back in time, they'd said. They left literature, helpline numbers, and world-weary sympathy behind them.",
      "Martha realized she was at her own front door. Her body had picked her up and carried her here through the gathering dark. She looked up. All the lights were off; her father must be in bed.",
      "Charlie had been living here when she went missing, taking advantage of the space, their mum's cooking, and the glow of parental approval while she slogged through her PhD. Martha had just left for university and was starting to experiment with life out of Charlie's orbit.",
      "As she put her key in the lock, she remembered Alex's shadow moving across the folded letter at the museum. Now it was Charlie's. Always here: the shadows of the past thrown against the walls and floors. She pushed open the door\u2026.",

    "summary": "The band announced Perry Bamonte's death on their official website on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Perry Archangelo Bamonte, longtime guitarist and keyboardist for the influential goth band The Cure, has died. He was 65.",
      "The band announced\u00a0his death on their official website on Friday.",
      "\"It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of our great friend and bandmate Perry Bamonte, who passed away after a short illness at home over Christmas,\" the band wrote.",
      "\"Quiet, intense, intuitive, constant and hugely creative, 'Teddy' was a warm hearted and vital part of The Cure story,\" the statement continued. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.\"",
      "Bamonte worked with the band in various roles from 1984 to 1989, including as a roadie and guitar tech. He officially joined the band in 1990, when keyboardist Roger O'Donnell quit. It was then that he became a full-time member of the group, playing guitar, six-string bass and keyboard.",
      "Having joined just after the band's mainstream breakthrough, 1989's \"Disintegration,\" Bamonte is featured on a number of The Cure's albums, including 1992's \"Wish\" - which features the career-defining hits \u2033Friday I'm in Love\u2033 and \"High\" - as well as the 1996's \"Wild Mood Swings,\" 2000's \"Bloodflowers\" and 2004's self-titled release.",
      "Bamonte was fired from The Cure by its singer and leader, Robert Smith, in 2005. At that point, he had performed at over 400 shows across 14 years. Bamonte rejoined the group in recent years, touring with the band in 2022 for another 90 gigs.",
      "In 2019, Bamonte was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of The Cure. He joined The Cure on their North American tour in 2024 when the band reduced tickets to as low as $20 after pledging to make the shows affordable for fans following complaints about exorbitant fees. \u00a0Lead singer Robert Smith said at the time he was \"sickened\" by the Ticketmaster fee debacle.",
      "His last performance with the band was on Nov. 1, 2024 in London for a special one-off event to launch their latest album and first in 16 years, \"Songs of a Lost World.\" The concert was filmed for \"The Cure: The Show of a Lost World,\" a film released in cinemas globally this month. It is also available to purchase on Blu-ray and DVD.",

    "summary": "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center has been canceled.",
    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "The Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, Roma Daravi, told CBS News in a statement: \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled \u2014 they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.\"",
      "In a letter to Redd, Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell called the cancellation a \"political stunt\" and alleged that Jazz Jams have faced \"dismal ticket sales.\" Grenell also said the center plans to seek $1 million in damages.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Redd for comment.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tyler Perry was sued for sexual assault by an actor who appeared in \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" marking the second lawsuit in recent months accusing the filmmaker and studio mogul of leveraging his power in Hollywood to make sexual advances.",
      "Mario Rodriguez filed the lawsuit Thursday in California, alleging Perry subjected him to repeated unwanted sexual advances over several years, including sexual battery and assault at Perry's Los Angeles home. Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million in damages and also has sued Lionsgate, which distributed the 2016 film, accusing the studio of turning a blind eye to Perry's alleged misconduct.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "According to the complaint, Rodriguez was approached in 2014 by a trainer at an Equinox gym in Los Angeles who said Perry wanted his phone number to discuss an acting role. Perry later encouraged Rodriguez to audition for \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" telling him, \"I'm not a bad person to know and have in your corner,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "After Rodriguez was cast, he was invited to Perry's home, where Perry allegedly touched him inappropriately while they watched a movie. The lawsuit describes additional alleged incidents in 2016, 2018 and 2019, including one encounter in which Perry allegedly attempted to unbuckle Rodriguez's pants and another in which Perry placed Rodriguez's hand on his genitals. The complaint says Perry gave Rodriguez $5,000 on multiple occasions following the encounters.",
      "Rodriguez says he resisted the advances and ultimately decided to file suit after learning of similar allegations made by another actor, Derek Dixon.",
      "Dixon sued Perry in June, alleging the filmmaker groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit, which was originally filed in L.A. Superior Court, has reportedly since been moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry's studio is based.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The average cost of a conventional 30-year U.S. mortgage continues to edge down, while rates on other home loans fell to less than 5.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level of 2025 this week, a boost for prospective home buyers.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",
      "Economists generally forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will remain slightly above 6% next year.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-delay-revoking-feds-threat-immigrants/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:37:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The minutes released Tuesday indicate that some Fed officials who supported the rate cut had reservations.",
    "story": [
      "Some Federal Reserve officials who supported cutting a key interest rate earlier this month could have instead backed keeping the rate unchanged, minutes released Tuesday show, underscoring the divisions and uncertainty permeating the central bank.",
      "At their December 9-10 meeting, Fed officials agreed to cut their key interest rate by a quarter point for the third time this year, to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years.",
      "Yet the move was approved by a 9-3 vote, an unusual level of dissent for a committee that typically works by consensus. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction.",
      "The minutes underscored the deep split on the 19-member policymaking committee over what constitutes the biggest threat to the economy: weak hiring or stubbornly elevated inflation. If a sluggish job market is the biggest threat, then the Fed would typically cut rates more. But if still-high inflation is the bigger problem, then the Fed would keep rates elevated, or even raise them.",
      "Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions, though all participate in discussions.",
      "The minutes showed that even some Fed officials who supported the rate cut did so with reservations. Some Fed officials wanted to wait for more economic data before making any further moves, the minutes said. Key economic data on jobs, inflation, and growth were delayed by the six-week government shutdown, leaving Fed officials with only outdated information at their meeting earlier this month.",
      "The minutes don't identify specific officials. But how they vote is public, and two policymakers dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged: Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed.",
      "The third dissent was from Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in September and favored a half-point cut.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, over time it can lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and credit cards, though market forces also affect those rates.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed also released quarterly economic projections, which also showed the extent of the divisions on the Fed committee. Seven officials projected no cuts in 2026, while eight forecast two or more reductions. Four supported just one cut.",
      "Weaker job market",
      "A weaker job market would likely spur the Fed to reduce borrowing costs more quickly. Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers had cut about 40,000 jobs in October and November, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.",
      "Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the Fed's 2% target, complicating the central bank's next moves. In November, annual inflation cooled to 2.7%, down from 3% in September, but last month's data were likely distorted by the shutdown, economists said, which forced the government to estimate many price changes rather than measuring them directly.",
      "Powell said after the Dec. 10 meeting that the central bank cut rates out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.",
      "While government data shows that the economy added just 40,000 jobs a month from April through September, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers actually shed an average of 20,000 jobs a month during that period.",
      "\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Powell told reporters. \"People care about that. That's their jobs.\"",

    "story": [
      "After yesterday's sharp selloff rattled the market, silver rebounded Tuesday, marking the latest twist in what has been a standout year for the precious metal, with prices more than doubling since January.",
      "Silver futures jumped to $78.03 per ounce on Tuesday, a 10% gain, after Monday's 8.7% decline, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "Gold futures have also soared this year, with the precious metal hitting record highs earlier in December.",
      "Investors have been piling into precious metals this year as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions, as well as a hedge against inflation. That's helped drive sharp gains in both silver and gold.",
      "\"Silver saw a record rally in 2025. The 150% increase is significantly higher than that of gold and other assets in the sector,\" noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email.",
      "Despite silver's price gains this year, the metal is still far from its inflation-adjusted price record, which was set in 1980, he noted. \u00a0\"To return to that level, silver would have to cost $200 per ounce today,\" he noted.",
      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-white-house-defund-cfpb/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:19:05 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",
      "A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

      "Proponents of the cuts argue that they can spur economic growth and make their states more competitive. At the same time, groups like the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have warned that reducing or eliminating state income taxes could stymie investments in public services such as education.",

      "Georgia, where the Republican Party controls both chambers of the state legislature as well as the governor's office, will trim its income tax rate to 5.09% in 2026, down from 5.19% in 2025.",
      "The state is set to decrease its income tax by 0.10% every year until the rate reaches 4.99%, according to WABE, NPR's member station in Atlanta. Some lawmakers have advocated eliminating the state income tax, the outlet reported.",
      "Indiana",
      "In Republican-led Indiana, the state's flat-rate individual income tax \u2014 a single rate applied to all taxpayers regardless of income \u2014 will fall to 2.95% from 3% at the start of next year, under a budget measure passed by the state legislature in 2023. The rate is slated to drop another 0.05 percentage point to 2.9% in 2027.",
      "Kentucky",
      "Kentucky's individual income tax rate will be cut to 3.5% on Jan. 1, down from its current 4%.

      "In 2023, the state had a budget of $1.9 billion but now faces a $432 million shortfall,\u00a0according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). Some lawmakers have\u00a0called\u00a0on the state to pause the next phase of income tax cuts to shore up the state's budget.",
      "North Carolina",
      "In North Carolina, where the governor is a Democrat and the state legislature is controlled by Republicans, the individual income tax rate will be reduced from 4.25% to 3.99% in 2026.",

      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",

At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",

      "Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said last week that, as President Trump searches for a new chair of the Federal Reserve, maintaining the banking system's independence is paramount.",
      "The market \"will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed,\" Moynihan said in a segment for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that was recorded on Dec. 17 and aired Sunday. \"And everybody knows that.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is the nation's central bank and sets the interest rates. At the agency's December meeting, it cut interest rates for the third consecutive time, reducing the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate at which banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "Interest rates had dropped to nearly zero during the COVID-19 pandemic, but steadily began rising starting in 2022 to curb inflation. The December rate cut put the benchmark interest rates at their lowest level since Nov. 2022.",
      "Throughout this year, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Jerome Powell, the current Federal Reserve chairman, whose term is set to expire in May 2026. Although the Fed chair is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, it is an independent agency and there is no legal precedent for Mr. Trump to fire the chair for anything but \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court\u00a0found in 1935\u00a0that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court\u00a0did allow\u00a0Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Moynihan said on \"Face the Nation\" that Mr. Trump has \"great candidates\" for when Powell retires in May. But Moynihan warned that he felt there is \"too much fascination with the Fed\" right now.",
      "\"We're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyers \u2014 all these people drive our economy,\" Moynihan said. \"The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack.\"",
      "Moynihan\u00a0 added that while he believed the Fed had a big role in \"stabilizing the economy,\" but \"you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.\"",

    "summary": "As many Americans head into 2026 with mounting money worries, reviewing your finances now could help put you on firmer footing next year.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are heading into 2026 with serious money worries as an affordability crisis collides with\u00a0stagnant wages, making it more important to take steps to shore up their finances.",
      "On top of that, a major tax overhaul is taking effect under Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" law, or OBBBA, creating opportunities to benefit from the new rules. Other financial changes, such as potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, could also impact your bank account next year, experts say.",
      "About 84% of Americans have new financial resolutions for 2026, including building an emergency fund or opening a high-yield savings account, according to a recent Vanguard survey. That resolve may be spurred by growing unease about the year ahead. About one in three Americans thinks their finances are likely to worsen in 2026, according to Bankrate, the highest share since the personal finance firm began tracking sentiment in 2018.",
      "\"The last few weeks of the year are a great time to review your finances, especially around saving, and it's important to know how you might be impacted by the new tax law,\" Sabino Vargas, a certified financial planner and senior financial advisor for Vanguard, told CBS News.",
      "Here are some tips to get your financial house in order as you prepare for the new year.",
      "Prepare for new tax changes",
      "The OBBBA, the spending and tax bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4, establishes new tax deduction rules for many Americans, including seniors and workers who earn tips or overtime.",
      "Under a \"no tax on tips\" provision, employees may deduct up to $25,000 earned in tips before Dec. 31. To qualify for the deduction, it's important that workers track their earnings closely because of the IRS's\u00a0reporting requirements, experts say.",
      "\"Document the numbers,\" Vargas said, noting that the same applies to individuals who work overtime.",
      "Some seniors are also eligible for an enhanced senior deduction beginning in 2025. Individuals who are 65 and older may claim an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 per couple, if they qualify.",
      "Because the deduction phases out for single earners with modified adjusted gross income above $75,000 or $150,000 for joint filers, seniors should check that income measure to assess whether or not they are eligible for the deduction, according to Vargas.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by finding your AGI, which is on line 11 of your Form 1040, with some deductions and non-taxable items added back in.",
      "Make a budget that will stick",
      "Affordability is a top concern for Americans, whose paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation. Making a budget that you can realistically follow is a good way to ensure you aren't wasting any money, financial experts say.",
      "It's essential, though, that any kind of budget you design \"matches the way you live,\" Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing director of Inspired Capital, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most budgets fail because they're too aspirational. The ones that stick are automated and grounded in your real patterns,\" she said.",
      "Von Tobel said she prefers the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which portions half of your take-home pay to essentials; one-third to lifestyle expenses; and 20% to goals such as paying off debt or saving for a vacation.",
      "\"A new year is a perfect time to readdress how your budget aligns with this framework and see where you need to adjust,\" she said.",
      "If the 50/30/20 rule doesn't work for you, there are plenty of other budgeting approaches, including the envelope system and zero-based budgeting. The envelope system sets spending limits for categories like dining out, with that amount placed in cash and used throughout the month.",
      "Zero-based budgeting assigns every dollar of your take-home pay to a specific category \u2014 such as rent, groceries or savings \u2014 until there's nothing left unallocated.",
      "AI tools can remove the self-discipline part of the equation for people and automate savings processes, von Tobel noted.",
      "\"Money management is becoming less about discipline and more about system design. Automate what you can, use tools that give you back time and clarity, and let your financial plan run even when your schedule gets chaotic,\" she said.",
      "Pay down high-interest credit card debt",
      "It's important to prioritize paying down high-interest debt like credit card balances because it's the most expensive to carry and \"can get out of control quickly,\" Vanguard's Vargas said.",
      "When it comes to shedding debt, von Tobel recommends tackling credit card balances with the highest annual percentage rates (APRs) first.",
      "\"Line up your balances by APR, automate all minimum payments and aggressively target the highest-interest line first. Structure beats willpower every time,\" she said.",
      "Another popular strategy for paying down debt is the so-called snowball method. It involves listing your debts by balance and paying off the smallest ones first, regardless of interest rates, to build momentum and stay motivated as balances disappear.",
      "Borrowers have other options for tackling credit card debt as well. One approach is to move balances to a 0% balance transfer card, which can eliminate interest for as long as 21 months. Another is to contact your credit card issuer to ask for a lower annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "Lock in savings rates before they fall",
      "The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, its third consecutive cut this year, and hinted at an additional rate cut in 2026.",
      "With at least one additional rate cut expected next year, it may make sense to open a certificate of deposit or a high-yield savings account before rates fall further, said Sam Taube, a lead writer with financial advice site NerdWallet.",
      "Online financial institutions are offering some of the highest rates, with annual percentage yields around 4%.",
      "\"If the Fed lowers rates further from here, they will offer lower fixed yields, so it might make sense to open up a CD of fixed-yield savings instrument like that sooner rather than later,\" he said.",
      "Make sure you're getting the full employer match",
      "If you have a tax-advantaged savings account through your employer, such as a 401(k), financial professionals say it's important to make the most of it. If your company matches employee contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.",
      "Vargas said a good starting point is to find out what level of contribution your employer will match \u2014 typically it's between 3% to 6% of your salary\u2014 and to contribute at least that much to your account.",
      "\"Work toward maximizing that employer match, so you're not leaving money on the table,\" he said.",
      "Setting up an automatic payroll deduction is an easy way to ensure you're contributing to your 401(k), Von Tobel said, adding that \"small, consistent increases create enormous long-term compounding.\"",
      "Before year-end, you can also make a last-minute extra contribution to your 401(k), according to CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger.",
      "Because retirement contributions lower your taxable income, \"you may also reduce your tax bill in April,\" she noted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Individuals on board two alleged drug smuggling boats jumped into the water after an initial strike on another boat on Tuesday, the U.S. military said.",
      "U.S. Southern Command announced Wednesday that three \"narco-trafficking vessels traveling as a convoy\" were struck in \"international waters\" a day earlier. Three people were killed when the first boat was hit, according to Southern Command.",
      "\"The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,\" Southern Command said, adding that the U.S. Coast Guard had been notified for search-and-rescue efforts.",
      "In a separate statement, the Coast Guard said it was notified Tuesday about \"mariners in distress in the Pacific Ocean.\"",
      "\"The U.S. Coast Guard is coordinating search-and-rescue operations with vessels in the area, and a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft is en route to provide further search coverage with the ability to drop a survival raft and supplies,\" the statement said.",
      "As many as eight people abandoned the remaining two vessels, three U.S. officials told CBS News. One of the officials said the strikes were conducted in the eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "A 46-second video of the strikes did not appear to show any survivors in the water.",
      "The U.S. military also said it conducted strikes Wednesday on two vessels, killing five people, Southern Command said later in the day, bringing the estimated death toll in the monthslong military campaign against alleged drug smugglers to at least 115.",
      "\"Intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking. A total of five narco-terrorists were killed during these actions - three in the first vessel and two in the second,\" Southern Command said.",
      "The Trump administration's handling of survivors has come under intense scrutiny, with some critics accusing it of committing potential war crimes after a follow-up strike on Sept. 2 killed two survivors. Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean Sea on Oct. 16 were detained by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin, prompting questions about the danger the Trump administration has claimed alleged drug traffickers pose to the U.S. Strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, who has since been presumed dead.",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 have sought to rein in the boat strikes, which come as the Trump administration escalates pressure against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The administration has accused Maduro of drug trafficking and working with gangs designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations, which Maduro denies.",
      "Lawmakers have raised the alarm that the strikes, which have not been authorized by Congress, could lead to war with Venezuela and have questioned their legality.",
      "President Trump, who has repeatedly threatened land strikes against Venezuela,\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" last week linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations, but his administration has provided few details on the matter.",
      "\"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Monday in Florida.",
      "Many Republicans have defended the strikes, including after the administration acknowledged that two survivors of the Sept. 2 boat attack were killed in a follow-up strike.",

    "story": [
      "As 2025 draws to a close there is one story that has captured the nation's attention. It's not the striking of boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly transporting drugs, or China's announcement of military maneuvers around Taiwan. It is the story of fraud in Minnesota, which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion.",
      "A viral social media video by YouTuber Nick Shirley, which was amplified by Elon Musk, Vice President J.D. Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi, has put the issue into the center of the national conversation, stoking a scandal that has been brewing in state politics for years.",
      "In the wake of the video, the Trump administration announced it is pausing federal funding to child care in Minnesota, with President Trump calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.\" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping changes to how all states must submit claims for Medicaid-supported daycares, including requiring \"a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"",
      "Even before the video spread far across the internet, however, scandal plagued Minnesota. In 2021, federal law enforcement first probed a series of multimillion dollar fraud schemes. Those fraud schemes have led to federal charges against 92 people with 62 convicted \u2014 and counting.",
      "President Trump and other Republican lawmakers have focused attention on the state's large Somali community, as most of the fraud defendants are of Somali descent, drawing stiff criticism from local officials, including the state's Democratic Governor Tim Walz, who denounced Mr. Trump's criticism as \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Walz, meanwhile, has faced intense scrutiny from both inside and outside Minnesota over his administration's handling of the crisis. The governor has acknowledged in recent weeks that the fraud problem could stretch into the billions, but disputed the $9 billion figure cited by prosecutors.",
      "While Shirley's video focused on allegations of fraud in daycares in Minneapolis, federal investigators told CBS News child care is only \"vaguely\" a priority for prosecutors, and attention and resources are instead focused on more than a dozen other social services programs in Minnesota, including nutrition, housing and behavioral health.",

The group claimed to work with restaurants and caterers to distribute meals to schools and extracurricular programs but instead submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices, raking in millions in administrative fees and getting kickbacks from people who ran their meal distribution sites, prosecutors said.\u00a0Feeding Our Future founder Aimee Bock was convicted earlier this year, and several others involved in the scheme have pleaded guilty or been convicted.Early on, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of reimbursements, prompting Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of racial discrimination. The state auditor's office found that \"the threat of legal consequences and negative media attention\" affected the state's decision-making process about regulatory action against Feeding Our Future.What federal prosecutors called \"the largest pandemic era fraud in the United States\" is \"just the tip of a very large iceberg,\" according to FBI Director Kash Patel.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As cities and towns across the U.S. prepare for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day celebrations, local, state and national law enforcement agencies are on the lookout for potential threats \u2014 concerns that are heightened in the wake of the recent Bondi Beach terror attack\u00a0in Australia and the deadly attack on last year's celebrations on Bourbon Street in New Orleans.",
      "Lone actors and small groups with a range of ideological motives pose the most significant threat to New Year's Eve celebrations, according to a joint bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The assessment, which is done routinely ahead of large public gatherings, notes there is no specific, credible threat this holiday. But the bulletin describes the persistent risk of small groups of people \"seeking to commit acts of violence motivated by a broad range of racial, ethnic, political, religious, anti-government, anti-immigration, societal or ideological beliefs and grievances.\"",
      "Colin P. Clarke, executive director of The Soufan Center, who focuses on domestic and transnational terrorism, called New Year's Eve the \"Super Bowl of counterterrorism\" \u2014 and the \"holy grail for a terrorist.\"",
      "\"It's a soft target, highly symbolic with large crowds gathered,\" Clarke told CBS News. \"It's the holy grail for a group like the Islamic state or a group or individual inspired by the Islamic state.\"",
      "\"New Year's is a symbolic day and it's a symbol of the West, and they're attacking the decadence of the West,\" he added.",
      "In New York City, the NYPD has been working on security for the Times Square area since last year's festivities, said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. There are \"no known specific credible threats\" to the celebration, Tisch said Wednesday, but the public should expect to see \"thousands\" of NYPD officers in the area.",
      "Intelligence teams will also be monitoring social media for threats, Tisch said. Times Square is expecting more than a million visitors from around the world, she noted, making it \"one of the largest and the most complex safety operations anywhere in the world.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Tisch said law enforcement is taking \"a layered approach\" to security, which includes the use of helicopters and drones for real-time monitoring.",
      "Asked about the heightened threat environment, Tisch said that's been the case for the last few years.",
      "\"The NYPD through our intelligence teams really keeps the pulse on what's going on throughout the world,\" she said. \"We have about a dozen detectives stationed in other countries, so any time anything happens we get real-time information and we update our security planning, for example, for events just like this one, based on what we're seeing and learning around the world and trends that we are seeing in counterterrorism.\"",
      "In Las Vegas, Andrew Walsh, undersheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told reporters at a news conference this week that the National Guard will be present in Vegas, as they have been in years past.",
      "Clarke worries that the U.S. has shifted significant resources to immigration and the border, to the potential detriment of counterterrorism operations. He said the \"bench is incredibly thin when it comes to counterterrorism.\"",
      "\"As an American citizen it makes me nervous,\" Clarke said. \"We are vulnerable to a large-scale terror attack.\"",
      "Recent memory serves as a sobering reminder of how critical it is for law enforcement to be vigilant.",
      "Earlier this month, the FBI announced it had\u00a0foiled an alleged New Year's Eve bombing plot in Southern California. The four people who face charges in the alleged plot are members of a group known as the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Attorney General Pam Bondi described the organization as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Hundreds of National Guard troops have deployed to New Orleans one year after the devastating New Year's Day attack there, at the request of Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. On Jan. 1, 2025, investigators say Shamsud-Din Jabba rammed a pickup truck into the crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing 14 people and leaving many more injured in an act of terror.

      "Chief Justice John Roberts said Wednesday that the Constitution remains a sturdy pillar for the country, a message that comes after a tumultuous year in the nation's judicial system, with pivotal Supreme Court decisions on the horizon.",
      "Roberts said the nation's founding documents remain \"firm and unshaken,\" a reference to a century-old quote from then-President Calvin Coolidge. \"True then; true now,\" Roberts wrote in his annual year-end letter to the judiciary.",
      "The letter comes after a year in which legal scholars and Democrats raised fears of a possible constitutional crisis as President Trump and GOP supporters pushed back against rulings that slowed his far-reaching conservative agenda.",
      "Roberts weighed in at one point earlier this year, issuing a rare rebuke after Mr. Trump called for the impeachment of a judge who had ruled against him in a case over the deportation of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members.",
      "\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" Roberts said in a March statement. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"",
      "Roberts has spoken about the importance of judicial independence before. In his year-end report to close out 2024, he highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "The chief justice's Wednesday letter was largely focused on the nation's history, including an early 19th-century case establishing the principle that Congress shouldn't remove judges over contentious rulings.",
      "While the Trump administration faced pushback in the lower courts, it has scored a series of some two dozen wins on the Supreme Court's emergency docket. The court's conservative majority has allowed the administration to move ahead for now with barring transgender people from the military, clawing back billions of dollars of congressionally approved federal spending, moving aggressively on immigration and firing the Senate-confirmed leaders of independent federal agencies.",
      "The court also handed Mr. Trump a few defeats over the last year, including in his push to deploy the National Guard to U.S. cities.",

      "It opened with a history of the seminal 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense,\" written by Thomas Paine \u2014 a \"recent immigrant to Britain's North American colonies,\" Roberts noted \u2014 and closed with Coolidge's encouragement to \"turn for solace\" to the Constitution and Declaration of Independence \"amid all the welter of partisan politics.\"",

      "A federal judge in California on Wednesday voided the Trump administration's move to terminate the Temporary Protected Status of roughly 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, calling it a \"pre-ordained decision.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua in June and July, saying the three countries had recovered from the environmental disasters that prompted the U.S. government to grant their nationals temporary legal refuge.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, the TPS policy allows the U.S. government to give certain foreigners deportation protections and work permits, temporarily, if their native countries are facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe.",
      "In late July, U.S. District Court Judge Trina Thompson delayed the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, issuing a preliminary finding that the Trump administration failed to consider lingering problems in three nations and that the decision to terminate the policies was motivated by racial animus, or racial hostility. That ruling was paused in August by an appeals court, allowing the Trump administration to end the programs.",
      "But Thompson issued a summary judgment on Wednesday, finding that the effort to revoke the legal status of tens of thousands of Hondurans, Nepalis and Nicaraguans was unlawful. She said Noem's move \"was preordained and pretextual rather than based on an objective review of the country conditions as required by the TPS statute and the (Administrative Procedures Act).\"",
      "\"The record specifically reflects that, before taking office, the Secretary made a pre-ordained decision to end TPS and influenced the conditions review process to facilitate TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",
      "The TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in the late 1990s, after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed thousands in Central America. Many of those previously enrolled in those programs arrived in the U.S. more than two decades ago. The TPS policy for Nepal was established in 2015, following a deadly earthquake in the small Asian nation.",
      "The Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to dismantle most TPS programs, arguing the policy attracts illegal immigration and that it has been abused by Democratic administrations and extended for far too long. It has also moved to terminate TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment on Wednesday's order.",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said Wednesday's ruling should allow TPS holders from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal to work in the U.S. legally and prevent federal immigration officials from detaining and deporting them.",
      "\"The court's decision today restores TPS protections for thousands of long-term law-abiding TPS-holding residents from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua,\" Arulanantham said.",

The lease was five years into its 50-year term covering the district's Rock Creek, East Potomac and Langston courses. The National Park Service owns the land.",
      "\"We are fundamentally in disagreement with the administration's characterization of NLT as being in default under the lease,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We have always had a productive and cooperative working relationship with the National Park Service and have worked hand in hand on all aspects of our golf course operations and development projects.\"",
      "National Links Trust said the courses will remain open for now, but long-term renovation projects will cease.",
      "\"At our in-progress Rock Creek Park rehabilitation project, construction has been stopped and our general contractor is in the process of demobilizing,\" the organization said. \"After five years spent navigating the complex Federal permitting processes, this development is extremely disappointing for all who have supported the project.\"",
      "President Trump, who spends many weekends golfing, has floated the possibility of redoing the district's courses. \"If we do them, we'll do it really beautifully,\" he said in an interview with\u00a0The Wall Street Journal\u00a0on Dec. 12.",
      "CBS News does not have access to the lease or financial statements to verify the claims of the parties of the lease.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:01:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Former special counsel Jack Smith testified for more than eight hours about the investigations and prosecutions of President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Judiciary Committee made public Wednesday a transcript and video from former special counsel Jack Smith's closed-door deposition before lawmakers earlier this month.",
      "Smith testified for more than eight hours before lawmakers and answered questions about his two investigations and subsequent prosecutions of President Trump, which ended after he won a second term in the White House in November 2024.",
      "The first probe involved Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, and the second stemmed from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in 2021. Mr. Trump denied any wrongdoing and has claimed Smith's investigations were motivated by politics.",
      "Smith had offered to testify publicly before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, as prior special counsels have done, but Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who leads the House panel, issued a subpoena for Smith's testimony in a closed-door deposition earlier this month.",
      "Lawyers for the former special counsel, who left the role before Mr. Trump's inauguration, reiterated their request for Smith to answer questions from lawmakers in a public forum following his deposition.",
      "During his private interview, Smith defended his investigations and said he was confident that he had sufficient evidence to prove the charges against Mr. Trump beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also repeatedly rejected any suggestion that he sought indictments against the president in an effort to harm his 2024 presidential campaign and said he never spoke to then-President Joe Biden or the White House about the investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "Smith told lawmakers that then-Attorney General Merrick Garland or other Justice Department officials never suggested he was expected to bring charges against Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said of the prosecution related to alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also lambasted the firings of Justice Department and FBI employees who worked on the cases against Mr. Trump, calling it \"awful\" and \"contrary to who I think we are as a country.\"",
      "\"I am both saddened and angered that President Trump has sought revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support staff simply for doing their jobs and for having worked on those cases,\" he said. \"These dedicated public servants are the best of us, and they have been wrongly vilified and improperly dismissed from their jobs.\"",
      "Smith revealed during his hours of testimony that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election-related cases, but said he had not yet made final decisions on whether to do so when Mr. Trump won re-election.",
      "Six unnamed co-conspirators were described in the four-count indictment against Mr. Trump over his alleged attempt to hold onto power. While they weren't identified, details and Smith's testimony indicated they appeared to be Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro, Boris Epshteyn and Jeffrey Clark, who was a high-ranking Justice Department official.",
      "Giuliani and Epshteyn spoke with Smith's investigators, he said. Giuliani \"disavowed a number of the claims\" he made publicly about the integrity of the 2020 election in an interview with the special counsel's team, according to Smith.",
      "Smith also told the Judiciary Committee that his team had evidence that Mr. Trump directed his alleged co-conspirators to call senators on Jan. 6, 2021, to persuade them to delay the vote to certify the results of the 2020 election.",
      "\"That was consistent with our investigation throughout, that the people that President Trump and his co-conspirators reached out to were people who they thought would go along or help them because of party allegiance,\" he said. \"And Giuliani, in particular, would reference that he expected their cooperation because they were Republicans.\"",
      "Smith told lawmakers that his team had lined up witnesses for the election-related case who were political allies of Mr. Trump but had pushed back on his alleged attempts to overturn the results of the election, including by submitting fake slates of presidential electors claiming the Republican had won their respective states.",
      "\"Our case was built on, frankly, Republicans who put their allegiance to the country before the party,\" he said.",
      "The former special counsel cited a former congressman from Pennsylvania, Thomas Marino, who agreed to be a Republican presidential elector and who Smith said characterized Mr. Trump's alleged scheme as an \"attempt to overthrow the government.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, he has continued to attack Smith, calling him a \"criminal.\" Republicans in Congress have launched their own probes into Smith's handling of the cases involving Mr. Trump, and he is also under investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position as special counsel.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday it has frozen federal child care funding for the state of Minnesota, citing viral fraud allegations.",
      "Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O'Neill announced the move in a post on X, writing that \"blatant fraud ... appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country.\"",
      "\"We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud,\" he wrote.",
      "O'Neill cited a video in which conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley alleged nearly a dozen Minnesota day care centers that receive state funds aren't actually providing services. O'Neill said the agency has identified the centers mentioned in a video and demanded that the state carry out a \"comprehensive audit\" of them, including \"attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections.\"",
      "CBS News conducted its own analysis of day care centers mentioned by Shirley. All but two have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months. The analysis found dozens of citations for safety, cleanliness and other issues, but no recorded evidence of fraud.",
      "Some of the day care centers featured in Shirley's video have pushed back against the fraud allegations. One of the facilities, ABC Learning Center, shared surveillance videos with CBS News that showed parents dropping children off on the same day as Shirley's visit.",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responded on social media, saying, \"This is Trump's long game. We've spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It's a serious issue \u2014 but this has been his plan all along. He's politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.\"",
      "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison also criticized the federal action, while vowing to hold fraudsters accontable.",
      "\"The Trump administration is threatening funding for the essential childcare services that countless families across Minnesota rely on \u2014 apparently all on the basis of one video on social media. To say I am outraged is an understatement,\" he said in a statement, adding, \"Let me be clear: fraud is unacceptable and individuals responsible for it should be prosecuted.\"",
      "Starting immediately, O'Neill said, all payments from HHS's Administration for Children and Families nationwide \"will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.\"",
      "The Administration for Children and Families sends some $185 million in child care funds to Minnesota annually, the agency's head, Alex Adams, said in a\u00a0video shared by HHS.",
      "Minnesota\u00a0receives hundreds of millions of federal dollars per year to support its Child Care Assistance Program, which subsidizes day care services for roughly 23,000 children from low-income families. In the current fiscal year ending in September 2026, the federal government's share of the program was expected to total $218 million, with the state kicking in $155 million, according to state projections.",
      "The moves by O'Neill came one day after agents from the Department of Homeland Security visited dozens of sites in Minneapolis, part of what DHS Secretary Kristi Noem described as a \"massive investigation on child care and other rampant fraud.\"",
      "In recent years, Minnesota has grappled with a litany of alleged fraud schemes targeting the state's public assistance programs. Dozens of people have been convicted as part of a scheme to bilk nearly $250 million from a federally backed child nutrition program during the pandemic, and federal prosecutors have charged people with defrauding Medicaid-supported autism services and housing stabilization programs.",
      "Federal prosecutors have estimated that fraudulent payments made by Minnesota's Medicaid service in recent years could total $9 billion or more, a figure that Walz has disputed.",
      "The fraud issues have drawn the attention of President Trump, who has focused on the fact that many \u2014 though not all \u2014 of the defendants are of Somali descent.",
      "Walz has defended the state's handling of the situation but vowed to crack down on fraud.",

Both houses of Congress would need to pass the bills again by a two-thirds margin to override the president's veto.",

It would also require the Department of the Interior to take action to protect structures in the village from flooding.",
      "The bill was backed by Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, and by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez and Democratic Rep. Darren Soto. Shortly before it passed the House in July, Gimenez said the bill was \"about fairness and conservation.\"",

      "Earlier this year, the tribe\u00a0joined a lawsuit\u00a0challenging an immigration detention center in the Everglades that state and federal officials refer to as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" The tribe has argued the facility could hurt the surrounding environment, impacting the tribe's ability to hunt and hold ceremonies on the land.",
      "The president also argued that the Osceola Camp was originally created without authorization, writing, \"it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.\"",
      "The tribe said in a statement it was \"disappointed\" by the veto, arguing the bill \"was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests.\"",
      "\"We have never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,\" Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said. \"Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments.\"",
      "Soto said: \"Trump's veto appears to be revenge for the Miccosukee Tribe's valid opposition to the atrocious 'Alligator Alcatraz.' It's sad, petty, and a violation of tribal sovereignty.\"",
      "Trump vetoes Colorado water bill \u2014 local lawmakers call it \"revenge\"",
      "The other piece of legislation that faced a presidential veto this week was the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That bill was aimed at completing a long-planned water pipeline that could serve some 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.",
      "The pipeline was first proposed during President John F. Kennedy's administration, part of a series of water projects in Colorado. But it was never built, in part because federal law required local communities to pay for it, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A 2009 law changed the funding breakdown and allowed local governments to pick up only 35% of the tab. The bill that was passed this year would have reduced those local entities' interest payments and given them more time to repay the costs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he vetoed the bill as part of a broader push to cut \"taxpayer handouts.\" He pointed to the pipeline's expected price tag \u2014 the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2023 it would cost about $1.4 billion, double the projected price seven years earlier.",
      "The president argued the legislation \"would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project.\"",
      "The bill was backed by the state's two Democratic senators and by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd, whose districts include areas that would be served by the pipeline.",
      "Boebert told CBS News in a statement the veto was \"very disappointing,\" writing: \"This fight is not over.\"",
      "Boebert castigated the veto in a separate\u00a0statement to local reporter Kyle Clark, calling the bill \"completely non-controversial\" and saying she hopes Mr. Trump's veto \"has nothing to do with political retaliation.\"",
      "\"I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects,\" Boebert wrote. \"My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado also strongly criticized the president's decision, writing on X: \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water.\"",
      "Fellow Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet accused the president of seeking \"revenge.\"",
      "Boebert drew attention earlier this year by\u00a0breaking with Mr. Trump\u00a0and signing a petition to force a House vote on a bill to release files on Jeffrey Epstein. The bill ultimately passed by nearly unanimous margins after Mr. Trump endorsed it.",
      "Mr. Trump has also lashed out at Colorado officials over the case of Tina Peters, a former GOP county election official who was convicted and sentenced to a multiyear prison sentence for tampering with voting machines. He\u00a0said in August\u00a0he would take \"harsh measures\" if she isn't released from custody.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing next week on alleged fraud in Minnesota public assistance programs, Chairman James Comer, announced Wednesday.",
      "The hearing is set to take place Jan. 7 and will include testimony from Minnesota GOP state lawmakers who have investigated public assistance fraud, Comer said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, have also been asked to testify at a second hearing on Feb. 10, Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of Justice is actively investigating, prosecuting, and charging fraudsters who have stolen billions from taxpayers, and Congress has a duty to conduct rigorous oversight of this heist and enact stronger safeguards to prevent fraud in taxpayer-funded programs, as well as strong sanctions to hold offenders accountable,\" Comer said in a statement.",
      "The House Oversight Committee is investigating allegations of money laundering and fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs. Comer earlier this month asked Walz and Ellison to turn over to House investigators documents and communications about the state's programs and has sought transcribed interviews with state officials.",
      "\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota's social services programs,\" Comer said. \"American taxpayers demand and deserve accountability for the theft of their hard-earned money.\"",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of what a top prosecutor in Minnesota said was \"industrial-scale fraud.\" The prosecutor, Joe Thompson, said earlier this month that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could reach $9 billion billed across 14 Medicaid programs that have been deemed \"high risk\" for fraud. Walz and other state officials, however, have questioned that amount.",
      "The scandal began when the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, which is based in Minnesota, was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program by falsely claiming to distribute meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 75 people have been charged in the COVID-era fraud scheme, and at least 56 have pleaded guilty.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered alleged fraud schemes involving a now-defunct housing stabilization program in Minnesota and a Medicaid-backed state program that provides services to children with autism. Homeland Security agents are also conducting investigations into child care centers in the state after a conservative YouTuber named Nick Shirley posted a video online over the weekend alleging that nearly a dozen centers that receive public dollars are not providing any services.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the day care centers mentioned by Shirley found that all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and state regulators visited the active locations within the last six months. While the centers were cited for safety, cleanliness and other issues, there was no recorded evidence of fraud.",
      "Still, in response to the allegations, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday that it has frozen federal child care payments for Minnesota.",
      "President Trump has denounced Minnesota leaders for their handling of the programs and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "In response to the Trump administration's decision to withhold child-care funding to Minnesota, Walz accused the president of \"politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"This is Trump's long game,\" he wrote on social media. \"We've spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It's a serious issue \u2014 but this has been his plan all along.\"",

    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

      "\"I want to recognize that while my name was the one on the ballot, this race was never just about me,\" Hardman told a room of supporters in West Des Moines after declaring victory.",
      "With 99% of votes counted, Hardman led by about 43 percentage points.",
      "Her win is the latest in a string of special election victories for Iowa Democrats, who flipped two Senate seats this year to break up a supermajority that had allowed Republicans to easily confirm GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds' appointments to state agencies and commissions.",
      "Democrat Mike Zimmer first flipped a seat in January, winning a district that had strongly favored President Trump in the 2024 election. In August, Democrat Catelin Drey handily defeated her GOP opponent in the Republican stronghold of northwestern Iowa, giving Democrats 17 seats to Republicans' 33. Celsi's death brought that down to 16.",
      "Republicans would have regained two-thirds control in the state Senate with a Loftin victory Tuesday.",
      "The GOP still has significant majorities in both chambers, including an airtight 66-33 supermajority in the Iowa House of Representatives, but not the two-thirds of both chambers that would have given it a supermajority in the Legislature.",
      "Without a supermajority, the party will need to get support from at least one state Senate Democrat to approve Reynolds' nominees. \u00a0Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, called Hardman's victory \"a major check on Republican power.\"",
      "\"With the last special election of the year now decided, one thing is clear: 2025 was the year of Democratic victories and overperformance, and Democrats are on track for big midterm elections,\" Martin said.",
      "In November, the party dominated the first major Election Day since Trump returned to the White House, notably winning governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats held onto a Kentucky state Senate seat this month in a special election. And while Republican Matt Van Epps won a Tennessee special election for a U.S. House seat, the relatively slim margin of victory gave Democrats hope for next year's midterms. The party must net three House seats in 2026 to reclaim the majority and impede Mr. Trump's agenda.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:54:58 -0500",
    "summary": "A court order suggests the Trump administration pushed to prosecute Kilmar Abrego Garcia only after he challenged his deportation, with one top DOJ official calling it a \"top priority.\"",
    "story": [
      "A court order unsealed Tuesday suggests that the Trump administration pushed to prosecute Kilmar Abrego Garcia on smuggling charges only after he challenged his wrongful deportation to El Salvador, with one top Justice Department official calling it a \"top priority\" over a month after he was deported.",
      "The newly disclosed details also indicate that top Justice Department officials in Washington, D.C., were involved in the decision to file criminal charges against Abrego Garcia.",
      "The Dec. 3 order was issued by U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw of Tennessee, who is overseeing Abrego Garcia's smuggling case and reviewing a request from his lawyers to dismiss the charges on the grounds of vindictive prosecution. He said he reviewed over 3,000 documents.",
      "Crenshaw's order indicated that on April 27, Aakash Singh, who works under Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche at the Justice Department, contacted several officials to talk about the Abrego Garcia case, including then-Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire. That same day, McGuire had received a file on Abrego Garcia from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "On April 30, Singh called the case a \"top priority.\"",
      "On May 15, McGuire wrote in an email: \"Ultimately, I would hope to have ODAG [Office of the Deputy Attorney General] eyes on it as we move towards a decision about whether this matter is going to ultimately be charged.\"",
      "\"While ultimately, the office's decision to charge will land on me. I think it makes sense to get the benefit of all of your brains and talent in this process and as we consider this case,\" McGuire wrote, according to the unsealed order. \"I have not received specific direction from ODAG other than I have heard anecdotally that the DAG and PDAG would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was indicted by a grand jury days later, on May 21.",
      "\"Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision,\" Crenshaw wrote in his Dec. 3 order.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on the order.",
      "Crenshaw is weighing a request from Abrego Garcia's lawyers for the criminal charges against him to be dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution was vindictive in nature. He has already ruled that there's been some evidence presented suggesting that vindictiveness could've played a role in the prosecution, and has requested more documents from the government.",
      "In the Dec. 3 order, Crenshaw said the Justice Department must produce certain documents that he said may be relevant, including the emails involving Singh.",
      "Last week, Crenshaw cancelled a planned January trial in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, and instead scheduled an evidentiary hearing for Jan. 28 to determine whether the government can rebut the preliminary finding that the prosecution was vindictive.",
      "Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador on March 15, despite a 2019 order from an immigration judge who had granted him legal protection from being sent to his native country. He was initially held at El Salvador's notorious CECOT mega-prison. In early April, after Abrego Garcia sued to challenge his deportation, a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, a ruling upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June to face federal charges related to allegations he transported immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "His attorneys argue that the government unlawfully decided to prosecute him as punishment for challenging his deportation in court. The administration has denied that Abrego Garcia's prosecution is vindictive, arguing there was \"no intent to punish the defendant for impermissible purposes.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody earlier this month, after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis found there was no valid deportation order to justify his detention. He has remained in Maryland ever since, alongside his American citizen wife and child.",
      "Xinis directed the Trump administration to file a sworn declaration by Tuesday outlining whether it plans to re-detain Abrego Garcia and if so, under which legal authority. The Trump administration has previously argued it can deport Abrego Garcia to a number of African countries, including Liberia.",
      "On Tuesday, Liana Castano, a top ICE official, said in a declaration that the agency \"does not currently intend to re-detain\" Abrego Garcia due to the court order that has prevented immigration officials from taking him into custody once again.",
      "But if that order is lifted, Castano said, ICE does intend to re-detain Abrego Garcia. And if that occurs, Abrego Garcia would not be eligible to request bond in front of a judge, with discretionary parole by ICE being the only potential mechanism for release, she said.",

    "story": [
      "Former Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne tribal chief who became a prominent American politician, has died. He was 92.",
      "His daughter Shanan Campbell confirmed to CBS News that her father died Tuesday at his home on a ranch in southwestern Colorado surrounded by family members.",
      "Campbell served in Colorado's congressional delegation across three different decades. He started out as a member of the Democratic Party and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1980s. In the mid-1990s, three years after his election to the U.S. Senate, he decided to leave the Democrats and switch to the Republican Party. He served two terms as senator and then retired in the 2000s because of what he said were concerns about his health.",
      "\"I thought it was a heart attack. It wasn't,\" Campbell said at the time. \"But when I was lying on that table in the hospital looking up at all those doctors' faces, I decided then, 'Do I really need to do this six more years after I've been gone so much from home?' I have two children I didn't get to see grow up, quite frankly.\"",
      "Campbell was known for his advocacy of Native American issues. He said his ancestors were among more than 150 Native Americans, mostly women, children and elderly men, killed by U.S. soldiers while camped under a flag of truce on Nov. 29, 1864. He helped sponsor legislation upgrading the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in southern Colorado, where the massacre happened, to a national park.",
      "His abrupt decision to switch parties in 1995 stunned Democratic leaders as well as his Colorado constituents. He was angry with Democrats at the time for killing a balanced-budget amendment in the Senate.",
      "\"It didn't change me. I didn't change my voting record. For instance, I had a sterling voting record as a Democrat on labor. I still do as a Republican. And on minorities and women's issues,\" he said.",
      "After he retired, he focused partly on the Native American jewelry that helped make him wealthy and was put on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. He also founded Ben Nighthorse Consultants which focused on federal policy, including Native American affairs and natural resources.",
      "Sen. John Hickenlooper, Colorado's junior U.S. senator, was among those who shared remembrances of Campbell after learning the news.",
      "\"He was a master jeweler with a reputation far beyond the boundaries of Colorado. I will not forget his acts of kindness. He will be sorely missed,\" Hickenlooper said on X.",
      "Rep. Diana DeGette, a Democrat who represents Colorado's 1st Congressional District,  said on X: \"He was truly one of a kind, and I am thinking of his family in the wake of his loss.\"",
      "Shanan Campbell confirmed that Cambell's wife \"of almost 60 years,\" Linda Campbell, was among those who were with him when he died.",
      "Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican who represents Colorado's 4th Congressional District, wrote on X: \"Colorado lost a true legend in former U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell. A proud Northern Cheyenne, Olympian, veteran, and trailblazing leader who championed our great state.\" She said that he and Linda \"were pioneers for Colorado and built a legacy of strength, service, and innovation that will inspire generations to come.\"",
      "Campbell never lost an election",
      "In 1982, Campbell was planning to deliver his jewelry to California, but bad weather grounded his plane. He was killing time in the southern Colorado city of Durango when he went to a county Democratic meeting and wound up giving a speech for a friend running for sheriff.",
      "Democrats were looking for someone to challenge a GOP legislative candidate and sounded out Campbell during the meeting. \"Like a fish, I was hooked,\" he said.",
      "His opponent, Don Whalen, was a popular former college president who \"looked like he was out of a Brooks Brothers catalog,\" Campbell recalled. \"I don't think anybody gave me any kind of a chance. ... I just think I expended a whole lot of energy to prove them wrong.\"",
      "Campbell hit the streets, ripping town maps out of the Yellow Pages and walking door to door to talk with people. He recalled leaving a note at a house in Cortez where no one was home when he heard a car roar into the driveway, gravel flying and brakes squealing.",
      "The driver jumped out, tire iron in hand, and screamed that Campbell couldn't have his furniture. \"Aren't you the repossession company?\" the man asked.",
      "\"And I said, 'No man, I'm just running for office.' We got to talking, and I think the guy voted for me.\"",
      "Campbell went on to win and he never lost an election thereafter, moving from the Colorado House to three terms in the U.S. House and then to the Senate.",
      "Born April 13, 1933, in Auburn, California, Campbell served in the Air Force in Korea from 1951 to 1953 and received a bachelor's degree from San Jose State University in 1957. He attended Meiji University in Tokyo from 1960 to 1964, was captain of the U.S. judo team in the 1964 Olympics and won a gold medal in the Pan American Games.",
      "Campbell once called then-Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt a \"forked-tongued snake\" for opposing a water project near the southern Colorado town of Ignacio, which Campbell promoted as a way to honor the water rights of the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes.",
      "He clashed with environmentalists on everything from mining law and grazing reforms to setting aside land for national monuments.",
      "Despite all this -- or perhaps because of it -- voters loved him. In 1998, Campbell won reelection to the Senate by routing Democrat Dottie Lamm, the wife of former Gov. Dick Lamm, despite his switch to the GOP. He was the only Native American in the Senate at the time.",
      "Campbell said his values -- liberal on social issues, conservative on fiscal ones -- were shaped by his life. Children's causes were dear to him because he and his sister spent time in an orphanage when his father was in jail and his mother had tuberculosis.",
      "Organized labor won his backing because hooking up with the Teamsters and learning to drive a truck got him out of the California tomato fields. His time as a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy in California in the late 1960s and early '70s made him a law enforcement advocate.",
      "His decision to retire from politics, Campbell said, had nothing to do with allegations that Ginnie Kontnik, his former chief of staff, solicited kickbacks from another staffer and that his office lobbied for a contract for a technology company with ties to the former senator.",
      "He referred both matters to the Senate Ethics Committee. In 2007, Kontnik pleaded guilty to a federal charge of not reporting $2,000 in income.",
      "\"I guess there was some disappointment\" with those charges, Campbell said. \"But a lot of things happen in Washington that disappoint you. You just have to get over them because every day there's a new crisis to deal with.\""

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:37:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The minutes released Tuesday indicate that some Fed officials who supported the rate cut had reservations.",
    "story": [
      "Some Federal Reserve officials who supported cutting a key interest rate earlier this month could have instead backed keeping the rate unchanged, minutes released Tuesday show, underscoring the divisions and uncertainty permeating the central bank.",
      "At their December 9-10 meeting, Fed officials agreed to cut their key interest rate by a quarter point for the third time this year, to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years.",
      "Yet the move was approved by a 9-3 vote, an unusual level of dissent for a committee that typically works by consensus. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction.",
      "The minutes underscored the deep split on the 19-member policymaking committee over what constitutes the biggest threat to the economy: weak hiring or stubbornly elevated inflation. If a sluggish job market is the biggest threat, then the Fed would typically cut rates more. But if still-high inflation is the bigger problem, then the Fed would keep rates elevated, or even raise them.",
      "Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions, though all participate in discussions.",
      "The minutes showed that even some Fed officials who supported the rate cut did so with reservations. Some Fed officials wanted to wait for more economic data before making any further moves, the minutes said. Key economic data on jobs, inflation, and growth were delayed by the six-week government shutdown, leaving Fed officials with only outdated information at their meeting earlier this month.",
      "The minutes don't identify specific officials. But how they vote is public, and two policymakers dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged: Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed.",
      "The third dissent was from Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in September and favored a half-point cut.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, over time it can lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and credit cards, though market forces also affect those rates.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed also released quarterly economic projections, which also showed the extent of the divisions on the Fed committee. Seven officials projected no cuts in 2026, while eight forecast two or more reductions. Four supported just one cut.",
      "Weaker job market",
      "A weaker job market would likely spur the Fed to reduce borrowing costs more quickly. Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers had cut about 40,000 jobs in October and November, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.",
      "Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the Fed's 2% target, complicating the central bank's next moves. In November, annual inflation cooled to 2.7%, down from 3% in September, but last month's data were likely distorted by the shutdown, economists said, which forced the government to estimate many price changes rather than measuring them directly.",
      "Powell said after the Dec. 10 meeting that the central bank cut rates out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.",
      "While government data shows that the economy added just 40,000 jobs a month from April through September, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers actually shed an average of 20,000 jobs a month during that period.",
      "\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Powell told reporters. \"People care about that. That's their jobs.\"",

That can include the immigration status of individuals, their address, phone number and date of birth.",

And some Democratic-led states\u00a0 also offer certain health benefits to immigrants who lack legal status.",

    "summary": "Brian Cole was arrested and charged earlier this month for allegedly planting two pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Virginia man accused of planting two pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on the eve of the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot appeared in court Tuesday as his lawyers and federal prosecutors argued over whether he should remain detained in the lead-up to a criminal trial.",
      "Judge Matthew Sharbaugh, who presided over the hearing, did not rule immediately on whether to release Brian Cole, 30, from custody, but said he would do so \"expeditiously.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyers argued in court papers that Cole poses an \"intolerable risk\" to the community and should continue to be detained. He faces two criminal charges stemming from the alleged planting of two improvised explosive devices in the vicinity of the RNC and DNC headquarters in Washington, D.C., nearly five years ago. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges.",
      "Sharbaugh revealed during the hearing that prosecutors secured an indictment against Cole from a grand jury convened in the District of Columbia Superior Court, which could raise questions about prosecutors' use of a local grand jury to charge federal crimes. A U.S. district judge in Washington\u00a0ruled last month that judges must accept indictments for federal offenses returned by local grand juries, but that decision has been appealed.",
      "Because of the ongoing litigation over the mechanism for charging federal crimes, Sharbaugh did not immediately accept the indictment against Cole.",
      "Prosecutors had urged the court to keep Cole in custody \"considering the extreme and profoundly serious nature of his crimes, the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the years he has spent deceiving those around him to avoid accountability, and the intolerable risk that he will again resort to violence to express his frustration with the world around him.\"",
      "The Justice Department said in court filings Sunday that Cole has confessed to constructing the bombs, filling them with explosive powder and setting their timers to detonate. Prosecutors argued that he evaded law enforcement and avoided accountability \"for actions that endangered lives and created a widespread sense of fear and terror.\"",
      "The devices were planted on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, and were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021, as law enforcement in Washington, D.C., were overwhelmed when a mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The bombs did not detonate, but the FBI said they were viable. The perpetrator who planted the devices eluded federal investigators for years, even as the FBI continued to release new video and information in hopes of a break in the case. Then, earlier this month, authorities arrested Cole after investigators looked at cellphone provider records, purchasing history and vehicle movements.",
      "Cole told investigators during an interview after his arrest that he had driven to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5 to attend a protest over the outcome of the 2020 election and did not tell his family he was going to a protest in support of Mr. Trump, prosecutors said. He said that after the 2020 election, he began following the issue on YouTube and Reddit \"when it first seemed like something was wrong\" and \"stuff started happening,\" according to Justice Department filings. He said that \"if people feel that their votes are like just being thrown away, then . . . at the very least someone should address it,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that when asked about his motive, Cole said \"something just snapped\" and he wanted to target \"the parties\" because \"they were in charge.\" He denied that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to certification of the 2020 election results, which took place on Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Cole's lawyers have argued in court papers that he should not be kept in custody while awaiting a trial, since he has lived \"without incident\" for the past four years. They told Sharbaugh during the hearing that they believe the devices planted on Jan. 5 would not have detonated and argued that there was no evidence Cole was \"riled up\" and had dangerous materials.",
      "In court papers, Cole's lawyers wrote that he has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Level 1 is the mildest form of Autism Spectrum Disorder, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.",
      "Cole's legal team also argued that he has no criminal history and said there is \"zero evidence\" to suggest he would flee ahead of a trial. He agreed to home detention with GPS monitoring, and would be supervised by his grandmother, according to court filings.",
      "\"There is no pattern of alarming conduct either prior to or after the alleged conduct at issue in this case. Mr. Cole does not pose a danger to the community,\" they wrote.",
      "Cole's lawyers have also asked the magistrate judge overseeing Tuesday's hearing to order any and all confessions or admissions Cole made to investigators to be turned over to his legal team.",
      "Cole, a Virginia resident, was arrested earlier this month after the yearslong search for the perpetrator of the alleged plot. In court documents, the FBI said Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge, Virginia, and works in a bail bondsman's office.",
      "His lawyers said that Cole \"can continue being a productive member of society upon release\" because he can return to his job, \"which will provide immediate structure and accountability.\"",

    "summary": "The Kennedy Center board, whose members were appointed by President Trump, voted earlier this month to add his name to the building.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some artists have announced cancellations of their upcoming performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, following the addition of President Trump's name to the building. Richard Grenell, president of the Kennedy Center, referred to the artists who canceled their shows as \"far left political activists\" who \"were booked by the previous far-left leadership.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center board, whose members were selected by Mr. Trump, voted earlier this month to add his name to the building. An official name change\u00a0appears to require approval by Congress. The president and his allies assumed control of the board earlier this year, sparking the decision by some artists not to perform at the institution. In March, Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a production of \"Hamilton\" that was supposed to be part of the events planned around the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Recently, more artists announced cancellations, including the jazz ensemble The Cookers, scheduled to perform on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"Jazz was born from struggle and from a relentless insistence on freedom: freedom of thought, of expression, and of the full human voice,\" The Cookers said in a statement on their website, although they didn't cite a specific reason for their cancellation. \"Some of us have been making this music for many decades, and that history still shapes us. We are not turning away from our audience, and do want to make sure that when we do return to the bandstand, the room is able to celebrate the full presence of the music and everyone in it.\"",
      "Some artists who announced cancellations were more blunt.",
      "The New York City-based Doug Varone and Dancers company cited the renaming of the building as the catalyst for their decision to pull out of April shows.",
      "\"While we totally disagreed with the takeover by the Trump Administration at the Kennedy Center, we still believed it was important to honor our engagement out of respect for both Jane Raleigh and Alicia Adams, who curated a first-rate dance season, as well as for the dance audiences in DC,\" the dance company wrote. \"However, with the latest act of Donald J. Trump renaming the Center after himself, we can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"",
      "A post shared by Doug Varone and Dancers (@dovadance)",
      "American Folk singer Kristy Lee posted on Instagram last week to announce the cancelation of her concert scheduled for Jan. 14, citing the decision to \"rebrand\" American history.",
      "\"I won't lie to you, canceling shows hurts,\" Lee wrote. \"This is how I keep the lights on. But losing my integrity would cost me more than any paycheck. When American history starts getting treated like something you can ban, erase, rename, or rebrand for somebody else's ego, I can't stand on that stage and sleep right at night. America didn't get built by branding. It got built by people showing up and doing the work. And the folks who carry it don't need their name on it, they just show up.\"",
      "Grenell responded to the cancellations in a post on X.",
      "\"The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership,\" he wrote on X. \"Their actions prove that the previous team was more concerned about booking far left political activists rather than artists willing to perform for everyone regardless of their political beliefs.  Boycotting the Arts to show you support the Arts is a form of derangement syndrome.  The arts are for everyone and the left is mad about it.\"",
      "When Kennedy Center leadership was revamped earlier this year, the president was trying to move away from what he views as \"woke culture.\"",

    "summary": "2025 was the third hottest year on record and pushed Earth past a critical climate change mark, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law, and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",

As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, are entering the public domain.",

      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections expire for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are becoming available for free use by anyone:",

      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:00:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

      "Lone actors and small groups with a range of ideological motives pose the most significant threat to New Year's Eve celebrations, according to a joint bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The assessment, which is done routinely ahead of large public gatherings, notes there is no specific, credible threat this holiday. But the bulletin describes the persistent risk of small groups of people \"seeking to commit acts of violence motivated by a broad range of racial, ethnic, political, religious, anti-government, anti-immigration, societal or ideological beliefs and grievances.\"",
      "Colin P. Clarke, executive director of The Soufan Center, who focuses on domestic and transnational terrorism, called New Year's Eve the \"Super Bowl of counterterrorism\" \u2014 and the \"holy grail for a terrorist.\"",
      "\"It's a soft target, highly symbolic with large crowds gathered,\" Clarke told CBS News. \"It's the holy grail for a group like the Islamic state or a group or individual inspired by the Islamic state.\"",
      "\"New Year's is a symbolic day and it's a symbol of the West, and they're attacking the decadence of the West,\" he added.",
      "In New York City, the NYPD has been working on security for the Times Square area since last year's festivities, said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. There are \"no known specific credible threats\" to the celebration, Tisch said Wednesday, but the public should expect to see \"thousands\" of NYPD officers in the area.",
      "Intelligence teams will also be monitoring social media for threats, Tisch said. Times Square is expecting more than a million visitors from around the world, she noted, making it \"one of the largest and the most complex safety operations anywhere in the world.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Tisch said law enforcement is taking \"a layered approach\" to security, which includes the use of helicopters and drones for real-time monitoring.",
      "Asked about the heightened threat environment, Tisch said that's been the case for the last few years.",
      "\"The NYPD through our intelligence teams really keeps the pulse on what's going on throughout the world,\" she said. \"We have about a dozen detectives stationed in other countries, so any time anything happens we get real-time information and we update our security planning, for example, for events just like this one, based on what we're seeing and learning around the world and trends that we are seeing in counterterrorism.\"",
      "In Las Vegas, Andrew Walsh, undersheriff for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told reporters at a news conference this week that the National Guard will be present in Vegas, as they have been in years past.",
      "Clarke worries that the U.S. has shifted significant resources to immigration and the border, to the potential detriment of counterterrorism operations. He said the \"bench is incredibly thin when it comes to counterterrorism.\"",

    "summary": "A U.S. District Court judge issued a summary judgment on Wednesday, finding that the effort to revoke the legal status of tens of thousands of Hondurans, Nepalis and Nicaraguans was unlawful",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California on Wednesday voided the Trump administration's move to terminate the Temporary Protected Status of roughly 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, calling it a \"pre-ordained decision.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua in June and July, saying the three countries had recovered from the environmental disasters that prompted the U.S. government to grant their nationals temporary legal refuge.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, the TPS policy allows the U.S. government to give certain foreigners deportation protections and work permits, temporarily, if their native countries are facing armed conflict, an environmental disaster or another emergency that makes their return unsafe.",
      "In late July, U.S. District Court Judge Trina Thompson delayed the termination of the TPS programs for Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua, issuing a preliminary finding that the Trump administration failed to consider lingering problems in three nations and that the decision to terminate the policies was motivated by racial animus, or racial hostility. That ruling was paused in August by an appeals court, allowing the Trump administration to end the programs.",
      "But Thompson issued a summary judgment on Wednesday, finding that the effort to revoke the legal status of tens of thousands of Hondurans, Nepalis and Nicaraguans was unlawful. She said Noem's move \"was preordained and pretextual rather than based on an objective review of the country conditions as required by the TPS statute and the (Administrative Procedures Act).\"",
      "\"The record specifically reflects that, before taking office, the Secretary made a pre-ordained decision to end TPS and influenced the conditions review process to facilitate TPS terminations for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal,\" Thompson wrote in her order.",
      "The TPS designations for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in the late 1990s, after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch, which killed thousands in Central America. Many of those previously enrolled in those programs arrived in the U.S. more than two decades ago. The TPS policy for Nepal was established in 2015, following a deadly earthquake in the small Asian nation.",
      "The Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to dismantle most TPS programs, arguing the policy attracts illegal immigration and that it has been abused by Democratic administrations and extended for far too long. It has also moved to terminate TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment on Wednesday's order.",
      "Ahilan Arulanantham, co-director of the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, said Wednesday's ruling should allow TPS holders from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal to work in the U.S. legally and prevent federal immigration officials from detaining and deporting them.",
      "\"The court's decision today restores TPS protections for thousands of long-term law-abiding TPS-holding residents from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua,\" Arulanantham said.",

The lease was five years into its 50-year term covering the district's Rock Creek, East Potomac and Langston courses. The National Park Service owns the land.",
      "\"We are fundamentally in disagreement with the administration's characterization of NLT as being in default under the lease,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We have always had a productive and cooperative working relationship with the National Park Service and have worked hand in hand on all aspects of our golf course operations and development projects.\"",
      "National Links Trust said the courses will remain open for now, but long-term renovation projects will cease.",
      "\"At our in-progress Rock Creek Park rehabilitation project, construction has been stopped and our general contractor is in the process of demobilizing,\" the organization said. \"After five years spent navigating the complex Federal permitting processes, this development is extremely disappointing for all who have supported the project.\"",

    "summary": "Former special counsel Jack Smith testified for more than eight hours about the investigations and prosecutions of President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Judiciary Committee made public Wednesday a transcript and video from former special counsel Jack Smith's closed-door deposition before lawmakers earlier this month.",
      "Smith testified for more than eight hours before lawmakers and answered questions about his two investigations and subsequent prosecutions of President Trump, which ended after he won a second term in the White House in November 2024.",
      "The first probe involved Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, and the second stemmed from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in 2021. Mr. Trump denied any wrongdoing and has claimed Smith's investigations were motivated by politics.",
      "Smith had offered to testify publicly before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, as prior special counsels have done, but Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who leads the House panel, issued a subpoena for Smith's testimony in a closed-door deposition earlier this month.",
      "Lawyers for the former special counsel, who left the role before Mr. Trump's inauguration, reiterated their request for Smith to answer questions from lawmakers in a public forum following his deposition.",
      "During his private interview, Smith defended his investigations and said he was confident that he had sufficient evidence to prove the charges against Mr. Trump beyond a reasonable doubt. Smith also repeatedly rejected any suggestion that he sought indictments against the president in an effort to harm his 2024 presidential campaign and said he never spoke to then-President Joe Biden or the White House about the investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "Smith told lawmakers that then-Attorney General Merrick Garland or other Justice Department officials never suggested he was expected to bring charges against Mr. Trump.",
      "\"The evidence here made clear that President Trump was by a large measure the most culpable and most responsible person in this conspiracy,\" he said of the prosecution related to alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. \"These crimes were committed for his benefit. The attack that happened at the Capitol, part of this case, does not happen without him. The other co-conspirators were doing this for his benefit.\"",
      "Smith also lambasted the firings of Justice Department and FBI employees who worked on the cases against Mr. Trump, calling it \"awful\" and \"contrary to who I think we are as a country.\"",
      "\"I am both saddened and angered that President Trump has sought revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents, and support staff simply for doing their jobs and for having worked on those cases,\" he said. \"These dedicated public servants are the best of us, and they have been wrongly vilified and improperly dismissed from their jobs.\"",
      "Smith revealed during his hours of testimony that his team determined they had evidence to charge some of Mr. Trump's co-conspirators in the election-related cases, but said he had not yet made final decisions on whether to do so when Mr. Trump won re-election.",
      "Six unnamed co-conspirators were described in the four-count indictment against Mr. Trump over his alleged attempt to hold onto power. While they weren't identified, details and Smith's testimony indicated they appeared to be Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro, Boris Epshteyn and Jeffrey Clark, who was a high-ranking Justice Department official.",
      "Giuliani and Epshteyn spoke with Smith's investigators, he said. Giuliani \"disavowed a number of the claims\" he made publicly about the integrity of the 2020 election in an interview with the special counsel's team, according to Smith.",
      "Smith also told the Judiciary Committee that his team had evidence that Mr. Trump directed his alleged co-conspirators to call senators on Jan. 6, 2021, to persuade them to delay the vote to certify the results of the 2020 election.",
      "\"That was consistent with our investigation throughout, that the people that President Trump and his co-conspirators reached out to were people who they thought would go along or help them because of party allegiance,\" he said. \"And Giuliani, in particular, would reference that he expected their cooperation because they were Republicans.\"",
      "Smith told lawmakers that his team had lined up witnesses for the election-related case who were political allies of Mr. Trump but had pushed back on his alleged attempts to overturn the results of the election, including by submitting fake slates of presidential electors claiming the Republican had won their respective states.",
      "\"Our case was built on, frankly, Republicans who put their allegiance to the country before the party,\" he said.",
      "The former special counsel cited a former congressman from Pennsylvania, Thomas Marino, who agreed to be a Republican presidential elector and who Smith said characterized Mr. Trump's alleged scheme as an \"attempt to overthrow the government.\"",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, he has continued to attack Smith, calling him a \"criminal.\" Republicans in Congress have launched their own probes into Smith's handling of the cases involving Mr. Trump, and he is also under investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position as special counsel.",

      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",
      "Economists generally forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will remain slightly above 6% next year.",

    "summary": "President Trump used his veto power this week for the first time since returning to the White House, rejecting a pair of bills linked to a Colorado water pipeline and a tribal village in the Everglades.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump used his veto power this week for the first time since returning to the White House, rejecting a pair of bipartisan bills designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado and give a Native American tribe more control over a portion of the Everglades.",
      "Mr. Trump vetoed the two bills on Monday, the White House announced on X, after they were sent to his desk earlier this month. The bills had backers in both parties, and they passed the House and Senate through voice votes. Both houses of Congress would need to pass the bills again by a two-thirds margin to override the president's veto.",
      "It's fairly rare for the president to exercise his veto power, especially when the president's party controls Congress. Mr. Trump vetoed 10 bills in his first term, all during his last two years in office, and former President Joe Biden used the veto power 13 times while in office.",
      "Trump vetoes Everglades bill over immigration dispute",
      "One of the bills \u2014 the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act \u2014 would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe has control over. It would also require the Department of the Interior to take action to protect structures in the village from flooding.",
      "The bill was backed by Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, and by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez and Democratic Rep. Darren Soto. Shortly before it passed the House in July, Gimenez said the bill was \"about fairness and conservation.\"",
      "\"It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, land and their way of life,\" Gimenez said in a speech on the House floor.",
      "But in a message to Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the project benefits \"special interests\" \u2014 and accused the tribe of not cooperating with his immigration policies.",
      "He wrote that \"despite seeking funding and special treatment from the Federal Government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.\"",
      "Earlier this year, the tribe\u00a0joined a lawsuit\u00a0challenging an immigration detention center in the Everglades that state and federal officials refer to as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" The tribe has argued the facility could hurt the surrounding environment, impacting the tribe's ability to hunt and hold ceremonies on the land.",
      "The president also argued that the Osceola Camp was originally created without authorization, writing, \"it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.\"",
      "The tribe said in a statement it was \"disappointed\" by the veto, arguing the bill \"was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests.\"",
      "\"We have never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,\" Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said. \"Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments.\"",
      "Soto said: \"Trump's veto appears to be revenge for the Miccosukee Tribe's valid opposition to the atrocious 'Alligator Alcatraz.' It's sad, petty, and a violation of tribal sovereignty.\"",
      "Trump vetoes Colorado water bill \u2014 local lawmakers call it \"revenge\"",
      "The other piece of legislation that faced a presidential veto this week was the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That bill was aimed at completing a long-planned water pipeline that could serve some 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.",
      "The pipeline was first proposed during President John F. Kennedy's administration, part of a series of water projects in Colorado. But it was never built, in part because federal law required local communities to pay for it, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A 2009 law changed the funding breakdown and allowed local governments to pick up only 35% of the tab. The bill that was passed this year would have reduced those local entities' interest payments and given them more time to repay the costs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he vetoed the bill as part of a broader push to cut \"taxpayer handouts.\" He pointed to the pipeline's expected price tag \u2014 the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2023 it would cost about $1.4 billion, double the projected price seven years earlier.",
      "The president argued the legislation \"would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project.\"",
      "The bill was backed by the state's two Democratic senators and by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd, whose districts include areas that would be served by the pipeline.",
      "Boebert told CBS News in a statement the veto was \"very disappointing,\" writing: \"This fight is not over.\"",
      "Boebert castigated the veto in a separate\u00a0statement to local reporter Kyle Clark, calling the bill \"completely non-controversial\" and saying she hopes Mr. Trump's veto \"has nothing to do with political retaliation.\"",
      "\"I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects,\" Boebert wrote. \"My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado also strongly criticized the president's decision, writing on X: \"Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water.\"",
      "Fellow Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet accused the president of seeking \"revenge.\"",
      "Boebert drew attention earlier this year by\u00a0breaking with Mr. Trump\u00a0and signing a petition to force a House vote on a bill to release files on Jeffrey Epstein. The bill ultimately passed by nearly unanimous margins after Mr. Trump endorsed it.",
      "Mr. Trump has also lashed out at Colorado officials over the case of Tina Peters, a former GOP county election official who was convicted and sentenced to a multiyear prison sentence for tampering with voting machines. He\u00a0said in August\u00a0he would take \"harsh measures\" if she isn't released from custody.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of the iconic French Quarter in New Orleans this New Year's Eve, one year after a terror attack killed 14 people and injured dozens of others.",
      "A caravan of National Guard Humvees advanced down Bourbon Street Tuesday night to block off entrances to the street that were not protected by barriers capable of blocking vehicles \u2013 marking the start of the Guard's two-month deployment in New Orleans.",
      "Their arrival was met with mixed reactions from people on Bourbon Street.",
      "\"There's National Guard everywhere, and they need to get outta here,\" said one local resident, Phillip, who declined to give his last name. \"This is a city where you just live life, live life to the fullest. However, you want National Guard looking over my shoulder? Don't like it.\"",
      "City leaders say the National Guard's help is a partnership, not an invasion.",
      "\"People need people, and they've answered the call to serve in this magnitude, and we should all be grateful,\" said Mayor LaToya Cantrell.",
      "One local resident who works security at a bar on Bourbon Street said the federal support makes him feel safer.",
      "\"It doesn't hurt to have the National Guard out here,\" said the resident, Chris Wolfe.",
      "\"Somebody did it once, doesn't mean they won't do it again,\" he said, referring to last year's attack, when an ISIS-inspired U.S. Army veteran barreled down three crowded blocks in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, attempting to hit as many pedestrians as possible.",
      "Dr. Dwight McKenna, the New Orleans coroner, described the scene as a \"nightmare\" that still haunts him to this day. He responded with his team of only two other people to conduct forensics.",
      "\"When I got the call, I thought it was a mistake,\" McKenna said. \"What I saw was a nightmare, bodies strewn everywhere, body parts here, body parts there, blood everywhere. Young people obviously had been killed, even the perpetrator was down on the ground, and it was, it was a scene I'll never forget \u2026 This one still wakes me up at night sometimes.\"",
      "Many are still seeking justice. Eighty people who were affected by the attack \u2013 including loved ones of people killed, attack survivors who were injured, and people who witnessed the attack and now live with anxiety and trauma \u2013 claim in a lawsuit against the city that it was a preventable tragedy.",
      "In the lawsuit, filed in October, they allege that some of the barriers that were in place were not working properly at the time. Other barriers for the sidewalk, called archers, were in storage and were not being used.",
      "\"It cannot be overstated that the city had the tools at their disposal on New Year's Eve to prevent this attack from occurring, or at the very least stopping it before it became far worse, and they failed to do so,\" said attorney Michael Ceresa, a partner at Romanucci and Blandin in Chicago, Illinois, which is representing the 80 people named as plaintiffs in the suit against the city.",
      "\"Back in 2016, the City of New Orleans undertook a comprehensive review of the security in the French Quarter, determined to find a way to prevent an attack from occurring on Bourbon Street or in the French Quarter, and they put a lot of resources towards implementing security protocols,\" Ceresa said. \"What we know is that that initial plan was failed from the start.\"",
      "Asked how the city has responded to the lawsuit, Ceresa said \"the city has been relatively quiet.\"",
      "\"They have not\u2026 made any overtures towards doing right by the victims to this point,\" he said. \"The bottom line is, the city has made no steps to take any accountability for what happened to date.\"",
      "The City of New Orleans declined to comment due to pending litigation, and pointed CBS News to a press conference about security plans for New Year's celebrations and Sugar Bowl festivities.",
      "In a news release issued Monday about their security plan for New Year's, city officials wrote, \"the City of New Orleans is grateful for the federal resources and coordination dedicated to support these events and appreciates the continued partnership. Local, state, and federal partners will continue to work closely to ensure appropriate preparedness, coordination, and situational awareness throughout the event period.\"",
      "Since the attack, the city has made several improvements to its network of metal barriers along Bourbon Street, to block vehicle traffic during high pedestrian traffic hours. But some people feel it's far from adequate.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of questions that need to be answered that haven't been answered yet,\" said Christian Pendleton, who manages a restaurant in the French Quarter and serves on the board of the French Quarter Management District.",
      "So far, only one gate that can withstand speeds above 40 miles per hour has been installed \u2013 located at the intersection of Canal Street and Bourbon Street, where the attacker first began his rampage.",
      "Pendleton wants stronger gates at many more intersections in the French Quarter.",
      "The city plans to vote on a measure to install more barriers once a newly-elected mayor takes office in January.",
      "\"I think it would be fair to say most people expected this conversation to happen months ago,\" Pendleton said.",
      "Tuesday night before New Year's Eve, as state and federal agents were taking their posts on every block of Bourbon Street, CBS News spotted several vehicles still weaving around crowds of pedestrians in the street.",
      "Meanwhile, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Monday she has completed her investigation into the city's security plan, but said she is not releasing her findings yet due to their sensitive nature. The investigation began after the attack.",
      "Other locals demand a permanent solution beyond federal support and barriers. This week, the city announced that Bourbon Street will be a pedestrian-only zone from sunset on Dec. 31 to sunrise on Jan. 1. Some would like to see it permanently become a pedestrian-only zone, during the daytime, too.",
      "It's a contentious topic, since businesses rely on vehicle access to receive regular shipments of goods.",
      "Brooke Gauthreaux, of nearby Gretna, Louisiana, believes that turning parts of the French Quarter into a permanent pedestrian zone is an important move that could help protect people. Her brother, 21-year-old Hubert Gauthreaux, was one of the 14 people killed in the New Year's Day attack.",
      "\"He was so thoughtful\" and a \"loving human being,\" Brooke Gauthreaux said. \"It's so cliche to say, but he was just the kindest, most beautiful person ever. One of my best friends, truly.\"",
      "She remembers the night her brother left to go out for New Year's Eve celebrations with friends.",
      "\"The second to last thing I told him, other than 'I love you' \u2026 I wanted him to stay home so bad,\" she recalled. \"I really just wanted to hang out with him, and I was trying to guilt him into staying home and I said, 'You're gonna be sad when you can't hang out with me and mom when we're dead,' and then he walked out the door and never came home.\"",
      "She said she doesn't think the city has done enough to improve security since the attack. She hopes other cities will learn from what happened in New Orleans, and craft a security plan and execute it.",
      "\"I would love to see a re-working of the city plan,\" she said. \"Because, it would break my heart to think that it could happen again.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing next week on alleged fraud in Minnesota public assistance programs, Chairman James Comer, announced Wednesday.",
      "The hearing is set to take place Jan. 7 and will include testimony from Minnesota GOP state lawmakers who have investigated public assistance fraud, Comer said. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison, both Democrats, have also been asked to testify at a second hearing on Feb. 10, Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of Justice is actively investigating, prosecuting, and charging fraudsters who have stolen billions from taxpayers, and Congress has a duty to conduct rigorous oversight of this heist and enact stronger safeguards to prevent fraud in taxpayer-funded programs, as well as strong sanctions to hold offenders accountable,\" Comer said in a statement.",
      "The House Oversight Committee is investigating allegations of money laundering and fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs. Comer earlier this month asked Walz and Ellison to turn over to House investigators documents and communications about the state's programs and has sought transcribed interviews with state officials.",
      "\"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota's social services programs,\" Comer said. \"American taxpayers demand and deserve accountability for the theft of their hard-earned money.\"",
      "More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of what a top prosecutor in Minnesota said was \"industrial-scale fraud.\" The prosecutor, Joe Thompson, said earlier this month that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could reach $9 billion billed across 14 Medicaid programs that have been deemed \"high risk\" for fraud. Walz and other state officials, however, have questioned that amount.",
      "The scandal began when the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, which is based in Minnesota, was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program by falsely claiming to distribute meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 75 people have been charged in the COVID-era fraud scheme, and at least 56 have pleaded guilty.",
      "Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered alleged fraud schemes involving a now-defunct housing stabilization program in Minnesota and a Medicaid-backed state program that provides services to children with autism. Homeland Security agents are also conducting investigations into child care centers in the state after a conservative YouTuber named Nick Shirley posted a video online over the weekend alleging that nearly a dozen centers that receive public dollars are not providing any services.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the day care centers mentioned by Shirley found that all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and state regulators visited the active locations within the last six months. While the centers were cited for safety, cleanliness and other issues, there was no recorded evidence of fraud.",
      "Still, in response to the allegations, the Department of Health and Human Services announced Tuesday that it has frozen federal child care payments for Minnesota.",
      "President Trump has denounced Minnesota leaders for their handling of the programs and attacked Somali immigrants, claiming they have \"ripped off\" the state. Many, but not all, of the defendants charged in the fraud schemes are of Somali descent.",
      "In response to the Trump administration's decision to withhold child-care funding to Minnesota, Walz accused the president of \"politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.\"",
      "\"This is Trump's long game,\" he wrote on social media. \"We've spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It's a serious issue \u2014 but this has been his plan all along.\"",

    "summary": "The Guard members will stay through Carnival season, when residents and tourists descend on the Big Easy to partake in costumed celebrations and massive parades before ending with Mardi Gras.",
    "story": [
      "A National Guard deployment in New Orleans authorized by President Trump will begin Tuesday as part of a heavy security presence for New Year's celebrations, a year after a terror attack on revelers on Bourbon Street killed 14 people, officials said Monday.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry requested troops to be sent to the city to support local law enforcement during year-end events and remain there through at least February.",
      "The deployment in New Orleans follows high-profile National Guard missions the Trump administration launched in other cities this year, including in Washington and Memphis, Tennessee. But the sight of National Guard troops is not unusual in New Orleans, where troops earlier this year also helped bolster security for the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras.",
      "\"It's no different than what we've seen in the past,\" New Orleans police spokesperson Reese Harper said.",
      "The Guard is not the only federal law enforcement agency in the city. Since the start of the month, federal agents have been carrying out an immigration crackdown that has led to the arrest of at least several hundred people.",
      "Harper stressed that the National Guard will not be engaging in immigration enforcement. \"This is for visibility and just really to keep our citizens safe,\" Harper said. \"It's just another tool in the toolbox and another layer of security.\"",
      "Approximately 142 Louisiana National Guard members will assist the New Orleans Police Department with road closures in and around the French Quarter and other event locations, according to the city's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. Hundreds of Guard members are expected to be part of the deployment, and will operate similarly to earlier this year when they patrolled the area around Bourbon Street following the vehicle-ramming attack on Jan. 1.",
      "Flags will be flown at half-staff across the state this week to honor the\u00a0lives lost in the attack. Jan. 1 through Jan. 4 is also now an official mourning period across the state for all the victims of the attack. Landry has asked churches, public buildings and other institutions across Louisiana to ring their bells 14 times at 3:15 p.m. on Jan. 4 in honor of those who lost their lives. The family of 21-year-old Hubert Gauthreaux told CBS News they hope people will honor his memory in a way that serves others. \"I want [others] to be inspired by his light. Maybe think of a small thing that would bring light to somebody else the way that he would ... Just small thoughtfulness would be a beautiful way to remember him,\" Gauthreaux's sister, Brooke, said.",
      "The Guard members will stay through Carnival season, when residents and tourists descend on the Big Easy to partake in costumed celebrations and massive parades before ending with Mardi Gras.",
      "Louisiana National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Noel Collins said in a written statement that the Guard will support local, state and federal law enforcement \"to enhance capabilities, stabilize the environment, assist in reducing crime, and restoring public trust.\"",
      "In total, more than 800 local, state and federal law enforcement officials will be deployed in New Orleans to close off Bourbon Street to vehicular traffic, patrol the area, conduct bag searches and redirect traffic, city officials said during a news conference Monday.",
      "The extra aid for New Orleans has received the support of some Democrats, with Mayor LaToya Cantrell saying she is \"welcoming of those added resources.\"",
      "The increased law enforcement presence comes a year after Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove around a police blockade in the early hours of Jan. 1 and raced down Bourbon Street, plowing into people celebrating New Year's Day. The attacker, a U.S. citizen and Army veteran who had proclaimed his support for the Islamic State militant group on social media, was fatally shot by police after crashing. After an expansive search, law enforcement located multiple bombs in coolers placed around the French Quarter. None of the explosive devices detonated.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the attack, 100 National Guard members were sent to the city.",
      "In September, Landry, a Republican, asked Trump to send 1,000 troops to Louisiana cities, citing concerns about crime. Democrats pushed back, specifically leaders in New Orleans who said a deployment was unwarranted. They argued that the city has actually seen a dramatic decrease in violent crime rates in recent years.",

    "summary": "At midnight on New Year's Eve, revelers across the globe will sing \"Auld Lang Syne,\" but not everyone knows the lyrics to the New Year's song or its origin.",
    "story": [
      "As the clock strikes midnight and the world ushers in 2026, revelers around the globe will sing \"Auld Lang Syne,\" a song about \"old acquaintance be forgot\" and, well, other lyrics people may not recall from the New Year's song.",
      "The song's origins date back to an 18th-century Scottish ballad, with \"Auld Lang Syne\" eventually becoming a New Year's celebration staple. Experts explained the song's lyrics, origin and staying power.",
      "What does \"auld lang syne\" mean?",
      "Roughly translated, the phrase means \"old long since,\" or \"for old time's sake.\" The song title is actually in Scots language, which is similar to English, according to Scotland's national tourist board.",
      "\"'Auld Lang Syne' can be literally translated as 'Old Long Since,' but the literal English does not give a sense of what it means to a user of Scots, where it refers to a shared past underpinning the current relationships of a family, community or professional/social association,\" professor Murray Pittock, a literary historian with the Centre for Robert Burns Studies at the University of Glasgow, told CBS News in 2023. \"As such, it is more evocative, nostalgic and communally unifying than any simple English equivalent.\"",
      "What are the song's origins?",
      "Today's song comes from a publication by Scottish poet Robert Burns. The poet was trying to preserve Scottish language and culture after Scotland and England formed the United Kingdom, according to Scotland's national tourist board. So he traveled the country and collected old Scots poetry and songs, including \"Auld Lang Syne.\"",
      "\"Burns said in one of the letters on view that he listened to an old man singing the song and that it had never been in print or in manuscript until he wrote it down from that old man singing,\" Christine Nelson, who once curated an exhibition on the song\u00a0at the Morgan Library in Manhattan, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "The song Burns wrote down can be traced back to \"Auld Kyndness Forgot,\" which was preserved in a manuscript from 1568, Pittock said.",
      "Historians believe that Burns substantially rewrote the words.",
      "\"He didn't make any secret of the fact that he was doing what he called 'mending' these old songs,\" Nelson said in her 2012 interview. \"So that they could be, you know, given to the public for posterity.\"",
      "His words were first published in 1796, according to the Library of Congress. Burns also sent a slightly revised version to a publisher in 1793, but that version was not published until 1799 \u2014 three years after Burns' death. The best-known set of words for \"Auld Lang Syne\" is the one published in 1799.",
      "Why do we sing the song every New Year's Eve?",
      "While the song has Scottish roots, its popularity in the U.S. is owed to a Canadian.",
      "Bandleader Guy Lombardo popularized it after he and his Royal Canadian Big Band played it on a New Year's Eve broadcast in 1929. In 1965, Lombardo told LIFE\u00a0magazine that he came from a part of western Ontario home to a large Scottish population. In that area, it was traditional for bands to end every dance with \"Auld Lang Syne.\"",
      "\"The main reason why Lombardo became identified as the Ghost of New Years Past, of New Years Present and of New Years Yet to Come, he says, 'is because Auld Lang Syne is our theme song \u2014 and was long before anyone ever heard us on the radio,'\" LIFE\u00a0reported.",
      "After Lombardo's 1929 broadcast, \"Auld Lang Syne\" went on to become part of popular culture, playing in \"Forrest Gump,\" \"Sex and the City\" and \"When Harry Met Sally.\"",
      "Harry and Sally even have a conversation about the song, trying to figure out its meaning.",
      "\"My whole life, I don't know what this song means,\" Harry, played by actor and comedian Billy Crystal, says in the 1989 movie. \"I mean, 'should old acquaintance be forgot?' Does that mean that we should forget old acquaintances or does it mean that if we happen to forget them, we should remember them, which is not possible because we already forgot 'em?\"",
      "\"Well, maybe it just means that we should remember that we forgot them or something,\" Meg Ryan's character Sally responds. \"Anyway, it's about old friends.\"",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Embassy in Italy\u00a0may have explained it best in a blog post: \"The lyrics of 'Auld Lang Syne' pose the question: How do we best remember the memories, friends and experiences of years before? The answer, Burns tells us, is to 'share a cup of kindness yet' as we journey into the new year.\"",

      "\"President Trump has been clear: We will not allow the illegitimate Maduro regime to profit from exporting oil while it floods the United States with deadly drugs,\"\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \"The Treasury Department will continue to implement President Trump's campaign of pressure on Maduro's regime.\"",
      "State Department principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Wednesday that the U.S. sanctioned the entities \"for illegally operating in Venezuela's oil sector.\"",

    "summary": "As the U.S. and Israel back Iranians' right to protest against their leaders, authorities in Tehran detain students and declare a sudden holiday.",
    "story": [
      "Tehran \u2014 Iran's prosecutor general said Wednesday that economic protests that have gripped the country were legitimate, but he warned that any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a \"decisive response,\" as the Islamic Republic's rulers tried to clamp down on a fourth day of unrest.",
      "\"Peaceful livelihood protests are part of social and understandable realities,\" Mohammad Movahedi-Azad told state media after protests started by shopkeepers in the capital city Tehran, which were joined by students and others in several cities across the country.",
      "\"Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response,\" warned Movahedi-Azad.",
      "His comments came days after the Mossad intelligence agency of Iran's arch-foe Israel posted on social media that it was \"with you on the ground,\" in a message to Iranian protesters. Posting on its Persian-language X account, the spy agency encouraged Iranians to \"go out into the streets together.\"",
      "In a post shared via its own Farsi language account on X, the U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it was \"deeply concerned by reports and videos that peaceful protesters in Iran are facing intimidation, violence, and arrests.\"",
      "\"Demanding basic rights is not a crime. The Islamic Republic must respect the rights of the Iranian people and end the repression,\" the U.S. government said in the post.",
      "\"First the bazaars. Then the students. Now the whole country. Iranians are united. Different lives, one demand: respect our voices and our rights,\" the State Department said in a subsequent post.",
      "The protests come amid mounting tension between the U.S. and Iran after President Trump said he had heard, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that Iran could be attempting to rebuild its nuclear program following the unprecedented U.S. strikes on its enrichment facilities in June. Mr. Trump warned that if Iran did try to rebuild, \"we'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Iran's president said Tehran would respond \"to any cruel aggression\" with unspecified \"harsh and discouraging\" measures.",
      "The protests, driven by dissatisfaction at Iran's economic stagnation and galloping hyperinflation, began Sunday in Tehran's largest mobile phone market, where shopkeepers shuttered their businesses. They gained momentum through Tuesday, with students at 10 universities in the capital and in other cities, including Iran's most prestigious institutions, joining in.",
      "Nevertheless, the protests remain limited in number and concentrated in central Tehran, with shops elsewhere in the sprawling metropolis of 10 million people unaffected. And the government appeared to be cracking down on the unrest, both on the streets with a heavy security presence, and by declaring a last-minute holiday to prompt the closure of schools and businesses.",
      "Iran's economy has been in the doldrums for years, with heavy U.S. and international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program weighing heavily on it. The currency, the rial, has also plunged in recent months, losing more than a third of its value against the U.S. dollar since last year.",
      "Videos posted on social media have shown crowds chanting anti-government slogans as they marched through the streets, while others show security forces using tear gas and purportedly live ammunition. CBS News has not been able to independently verify the video clips posted online, some of which show heavily armed security forces appearing to detain multiple people, including students, and others in which apparent gunfire can be heard.",
      "The Guild Council of the University of Tehran said six students were detained but later released. There were unconfirmed reports that at least one student was severely injured during a confrontation with security services in Tehran.",
      "A last-minute holiday",
      "The streets of Tehran were calm early Wednesday, a change from the usual chaotic and choking traffic, after authorities announced a national holiday with just a day's notice. Many schools, banks and public institutions were closed, with officials saying the directive was due to the cold weather and the need to save energy.",
      "The capital's prestigious Beheshti and Allameh Tabataba'i universities announced that classes would be held online throughout next week for the same reason, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "The authorities did not link the bank holiday to the protests. Tehran is experiencing daytime temperatures near the freezing mark, which is not unusual for this time of year.",
      "Weekends in Iran begin on Thursdays, while this Saturday marks a long-standing national holiday.",
      "Iran is no stranger to nationwide protests, but the latest demonstrations have not come close to the last major outbreak in 2022, which was triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian woman.",
      "Her death in custody after being arrested for allegedly violating the nation's strict dress code for women sparked a wave of anger across the country. Several hundred people were killed, including dozens of members of the security forces, who waged a dramatic crackdown in response, arresting hundreds of people.",
      "There were also widespread protests in 2019, sparked by a sharp increase in the price of petrol.",

    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 Nearly 60 women lawmakers in Japan, including Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, have submitted a petition calling for more toilets in the parliament building to match their improved representation.",
      "Although the number of women politicians rose in the last election -- and despite Takaichi becoming the first female prime minister in October -- Japanese politics remains massively male-dominated.",
      "This is reflected by there being only one lavatory containing two cubicles near the Diet's main plenary session hall for the 73 women elected to the lower house, according to the petition.",
      "\"Before plenary sessions start, truly so many women lawmakers have to form long queues in front of the restroom,\" said Yasuko Komiyama, from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party.",
      "She was speaking after submitting the cross-party appeal signed by 58 women to Yasukazu Hamada, the chair of the lower house committee on rules and administration, earlier this month.",
      "The Diet building was finished in 1936, nearly a decade before women got the vote in December 1945 following Japan's defeat in World War II.",
      "The entire lower house building has 12 men's toilets with 67 stalls and nine women's facilities with a total of 22 cubicles, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.",
      "Japan ranked 118 out of 148 this year in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report. Women are also grossly under-represented in business and the media.",
      "In elections, women candidates say they often have to deal with sexist jibes, including being told that they should be at home looking after children.",
      "In the last election, in 2024, 73 women were elected to the 465-seat lower house -- one has since left -- up from 45 in the previous parliament. There are 74 women in the 248-seat upper house.",
      "The government's stated target is to have women occupy at least 30 percent of the legislative seats.",
      "Takaichi, an admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said before becoming premier that she wanted \"Nordic\" levels of gender balance in her cabinet.",
      "But, in the end, she appointed just two other women to her 19-strong cabinet.",
      "Takaichi, 64, has said she hopes to raise awareness about women's health struggles and has spoken candidly about her own experience with menopause.",
      "But she is still seen as socially conservative.",
      "She opposes revising a 19th-century law requiring married couples to share the same surname and wants the imperial family to retain male-only succession.",
      "The increasing demand for women's toilets can be seen as a sign of progress for Japan although it also reflects the nation's failure to achieve gender equality, Komiyama said.",
      "\"In a way, this symbolizes how the number of female lawmakers has increased,\" Komiyama told reporters, according to her party's website, adding that she hoped for more equality in other areas of life.",

    "summary": "U.S.-British firm Ocean Infinity intends to scour almost 6,000 square miles of seafloor for the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777.",
    "story": [
      "Almost 12 years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished over the Indian Ocean with 239 people on board, the search for the Boeing 777's wreckage was scheduled to resume Tuesday in the Indian Ocean \u2014 supported by the latest advancements in deep-sea, self-guided drone technology.",
      "MH370 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur shortly after midnight on March 8, 2014. It should have been a routine, roughly six-hour flight north to Beijing.",
      "About 40 minutes later, the aircraft's transponder switched off, which made it disappear from civilian air traffic control monitors. Military radar, however, picked up the plane banking sharply west, back over the Malay Peninsula and out over the third largest body of water in the world, the vast Indian Ocean.",
      "The initial search for the aircraft covered more than 46,000 square miles off the coast of western Australia, an area larger than the state of Virginia. But using drift analysis, incorporating data on the history of ocean currents and winds, the people in charge of the search have now narrowed down the area of highest probability for success to around 5,800 square miles.",
      "British-American deep sea robotics company Ocean Infinity has not revealed the location of the new search, but it hopes to finally solve the tragic mystery by deploying a fleet of the world's most advanced underwater drones.",
      "The drones, or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), are capable of diving nearly 20,000 feet and running for up to 100 hours before they need to resurface. They're equipped with side-scan sonar to create detailed 3D images of the seafloor \u2014 and anything on it \u2014   as they cruise near the bottom, following the contour up and down mountains and into trenches hidden in the abyss.",
      "The AUVs can also use ultrasound imaging to peer beneath seafloor sediment that's built up over the years, as well as magnetometers that could detect metals in the wreckage of the lost aircraft.",
      "If an object of interest is detected, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) would then be deployed to take a closer look.",
      "To date, fewer than 30 fragments believed to be from MH370 have washed up on different shores across the Indian Ocean.",
      "The first was found in 2015, on the French island of La R\u00e9union, more than 400 miles off the eastern coast of Madagascar. A beach cleaner found a flaperon that would have helped the plane roll to the left or right during flight.",
      "Through 2016, more fragments were found washed ashore on Madagascar itself, as well as in Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius, including a door that covered the front landing gear, a flap from the right wing, and a panel from where a wing joined onto the aircraft's fuselage \u2014 what should have been one of the aircraft's strongest joints.",
      "So far, no remains of the aircraft's crew or passengers \u2014   who came from 14 countries including China, Australia, France, the United States, Ukraine and Russia \u2014   have been found.",
      "Malaysia's government agreed to pay Ocean Infinity $70 million, but it has been labelled a \"no-find, no fee\" contract, meaning the company only gets paid if it finds the missing plane.",
      "Given the huge amount of money invested in the search effort, $70 million wouldn't actually be a massive payout, but Ocean Infinity would also be able to boast solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries since American aviator Amelia Earhart vanished in 1937 somewhere over the central Pacific Ocean.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump says the U.S. \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" last week linked to alleged drug boat operations, although he didn't offer many details.",
      "\"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he spoke to reporters at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "In a\u00a0radio interview Friday, the president said the U.S. hit the facility \"very hard\" two nights before. The president didn't offer the location of the facility, but he has been threatening land strikes in Venezuela following a string of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.",
      "\"We just knocked out, I don't know if you read or you saw, they have a big plant or a big facility where they send, where the ships come from,\" Mr. Trump said after calling into \"Sid and Friends in the Morning\" on 77 WABC Friday. \"Two nights ago, we knocked that out, so we hit them very hard.\"",
      "On Monday, he added that it had struck what he called \"the implementation area,\" adding, \"that is no longer around.\"",
      "The\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported that president was referring to a drug facility in Venezuela. CNN reported\u00a0that the CIA used a drone strike to carry out the attack.",
      "The CIA declined to comment on its reported involvement in this operation.",
      "The Trump administration has not disclosed any more details about the strike. On Tuesday, Col. Allie Weiskopf, a spokesperson for U.S. Special Operations Command said in a statement, \"Special Operations did not support this operation to include intel support.\"",
      "The Pentagon referred questions to the White House. The White House has not yet responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Since September, the U.S. military has targeted more than two dozen boats the administration alleged were ferrying drugs, killing at least 107 people in the strikes. The 30th boat strike took place in the eastern Pacific on Monday, killing two people on board, U.S. Southern Command announced.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of drug trafficking and working with gangs designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations \u2014 which Maduro denies.

      "Cecilia Gim\u00e9nez, the Spanish woman whose botched restoration of a century-old painting of Jesus Christ captured global headlines more than a decade ago, has died. She was 94.",
      "Officials in Borja, northeastern Spain, confirmed Gim\u00e9nez's death on Facebook. Mayor Eduardo Arilla told a local newspaper she died in a nursing home, The New York Times reported.",
      "The foundation that manages the church in Borja where the \"Ecce Homo\" fresco is displayed\u00a0said she was a great lover of painting from a young age. The foundation called her \"one of the most famous figures of 2012\" and noted that she had, \"with the best intentions, decided to repaint\" the fresco at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church because of its poor condition.",
      "Gim\u00e9nez's attempt left Christ's face cartoonish and unrecognizable, sparking a flood of online reactions, memes, and parodies featuring famous figures such as Michael Jackson and Homer Simpson.",
      "Her restoration added what appeared to be a mane to the figure of Christ, leading the small painting by local artist Elias Garcia Martinez, created in the 1910s, to be nicknamed the \"Monkey Christ.\"",
      "At the time, Gim\u00e9nez acknowledged the damage, but she told a state-run broadcaster that the parish priest authorized the restoration.",
      "\"The priest knew! He did! How could we do something like that without permission? He knew,\" Gim\u00e9nez said. \"Everybody who came into the church could see me as I was painting. I didn't do anything secretly.\"",
      "The controversy quickly turned Borja into a tourist destination, with about 57,000 visitors coming to see the previously little-known church the following year.",
      "When the controversy subsided, supporters helped Gim\u00e9nez put on an art exhibition featuring 28 of her own paintings, CBS News partner BBC News\u00a0reported.",

      "Four people were injured and around 100 were left stranded atop a mountain in northwest Italy on Tuesday after a cable car accident, authorities said. The visitors stuck on the mountaintop were later evacuated by helicopter.",
      "No one was seriously injured following the incident on the Macugnaga cable car, which travels up to the Moro Pass at an altitude of 2,800 meters (9,000 feet) near the Swiss border, a spokesman for the Alpine rescue services told the Agence France-Press news agency.",
      "\"It appears that the cabin arrived at the top station at excessive speed, which caused the accident,\" the service said in a statement.",
      "In a separate statement, the fire service said the accident involved two cabins, which \"impacted the structures of the upper and lower stations.\"",
      "Three of the 15 passengers in the upper cabin were hurt, along with an operator at the lower station, it said.",
      "The crash happened at about 11:30 a.m. local time. Authorities said it took about three hours for all of those stranded to be evacuated by helicopter.",
      "Filippo Besozzi, administrator of the company that manages the cable car, told the ANSA news agency that the most seriously injured was a 59-year-old man who hurt his arm.",
      "He said there had been a \"technical problem\" and the cable car did not slow down properly as it entered the station, and hit a barrier.",
      "He said there was no significant damage to the cable car, which was renovated in 2023, but it was undergoing checks.",

      "Melbourne, Australia\u00a0\u2014 An investigation that extended to the Philippines of two men accused of shooting dead 15 people at a Sydney Jewish festival has found no evidence that they were part of a \"broader terrorist cell,\" police said on Tuesday.",
      "Sydney residents Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram spent most of November in Davao City in the southern Philippines, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said.",
      "They returned on a flight from Manila on Nov. 29. Two weeks later, they are accused of killing 15 and wounding another 40 in a mass shooting that targeted a Hannukah festival at Bondi Beach.",
      "Philippine National Police determined the pair rarely left their hotel during the visit, Barrett said.",
      "\"There is no evidence to suggest they received training or underwent logistical preparation for their alleged attack,\" Barrett told reporters.",
      "\"These individuals are alleged to have acted alone. There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack. However, I want to be clear, I am not suggesting that they were there for tourism,\" Barrett added.",
      "Barrett did not detail a motive for the visit, which began on Nov. 1.",
      "A receptionist at the hotel in Davao City where the attackers stayed also told CBS News they never left their room for more than a day. Jojo, who works at at the GV Hotel, said the father and son checked in on Nov. 1 and left on Nov. 28. He said they extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day, but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "Police and Australia's prime minister have alleged the pair were inspired by the ISIS terror group. The southern Philippines once drew small numbers of foreign militants aligned with ISIS or al Qaeda to train in a secessionist conflict involving minority Muslims in the largely Catholic nation.",
      "Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College, who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News it would be very difficult for foreigners to receive weapons training from the ISIS affiliated group in the region.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Barrett said she was limited in what she could disclose about the investigation in the Philippines because she did not want to prejudice Naveed Akram's trial.",
      "He has yet to enter pleas to dozens of charges including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. Police shot him in the abdomen during a gunfight at Bondi on Dec. 14 and he spent a week in a hospital before he was transferred to a prison. Police shot his father dead at Bondi.",
      "Authorities are promising the largest police presence ever at New Year's Eve festivities at Sydney Harbor on Wednesday. More than 2,500 officers will be on duty. Many will be openly carrying automatic rifles, a sight rarely seen on Sydney streets.",
      "The first police responders to the Bondi massacre were armed with Glock pistols that lacked the lethal range of the Akrams' rifles and shotguns. Two police officers were among the wounded.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the state was not moving toward a more militarized police force in response to the attack.",
      "\"Given we've just had the worst terrorism event in Australia's history inside the last month, it would be self-evidently the case that things need to change and the security needs to change,\" Minns said.",
      "\"I understand that there'll be some people that oppose this or regard it as the militarization of the police. My sense is far more families would fully support that kind of police operation because they will feel far safer in that environment,\" Minns added.",
      "More than 1 million revelers crowd the waterfront each year to see a world-famous fireworks display centered on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.",
      "Minns said he was concerned that any reduction in crowd numbers would be interpreted by extremists as a victory.",
      "\"It's an opportunity to thumb our nose at the terrorists and their ideology that really would have us living in a ball and not celebrating this beautiful city. So this is an opportunity to live your life and show defiance to that kind of ideology,\" Minns said.",
      "The Bondi victims will be commemorated with one minute of silence at 11 p.m. on Wednesday when four images of a Jewish candelabrum known as a menorah will be projected on the bridge's pylons, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore said.",
      "Local government authorities had planned to project images of a dove with the word \"peace,\" but that was changed after consultation with Jewish representatives.",

      "Berlin \u2014 Robbers used a large drill to break into a German savings bank's vault room and steal cash, gold and jewelry worth some 30 million euros ($35 million), police said Tuesday.",
      "The heist in the western city of Gelsenkirchen saw the thieves break into more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes, they said.",
      "While the criminals remained at large, hundreds of distressed bank customers massed outside the branch on Tuesday demanding information, but were kept at bay by police.",
      "According to police, the robbers drilled their way into the underground vault room of the Sparkasse savings bank from a parking garage.",
      "Investigators suspect the gang spent much of the weekend inside, breaking open the deposit boxes.",
      "The break-in came to light after a fire alarm was triggered in the early hours of Monday and emergency services discovered the hole.",
      "Witnesses reported seeing several men carrying large bags in the stairwell of the parking garage during the night from Saturday to Sunday.",
      "Footage from security cameras has also shown a black Audi RS 6 leaving the parking garage early Monday morning, with masked persons inside.",
      "The car's license plate had been stolen earlier in the city of Hanover, police said.",

      "The robbery comes amid ongoing moves by managers of one of Europe's most famous museums, the Louvre in Paris, to tighten up security in the wake of a brazen heist that saw thieves break in through an upper story window to steal French crown jewels valued at an estimated $102 million. The four suspected thieves have been arrested, but none of the state treasures have been recovered.",
      "Several victims of the robbery in Germany had told police officers that their losses far exceeded the insured value of their safe deposit boxes.",

    "summary": "After meeting with Israel's Netanyahu, Trump said he'd heard Iran is trying to rebuild its nuclear program, \"and if they are, we're going to have to knock them down.\"",
    "story": [
      "Tehran, Iran\u00a0\u2014 Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian promised on Tuesday a harsh response to any attack, appearing to respond to a warning the previous day by President Trump over Iran's purported attempts to rebuild its nuclear program.",
      "\"Answer of Islamic Republic of Iran to any cruel aggression will be harsh and discouraging,\" Pezeshkian said in a social media post.",
      "Pezeshkian did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Mr. Trump suggested the U.S. could carry out new military strikes if Iran attempts to reconstitute its nuclear program.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment during wide-ranging talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the U.S. leader's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.",
      "\"Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again,\" Mr. Trump said during a news conference with Netanyahu after their meeting. \"And if they are, we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"",
      "The two leaders discussed the possibility of renewed military action against Tehran months after a 12-day air war in June that killed nearly 1,100 Iranians, including senior military commanders and scientists. Iran's retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 people in Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" of Iran's nuclear program after three sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. in June, but questions were raised\u00a0about the extent of the damage inflicted. An\u00a0initial classified assessment\u00a0determined that the strikes had set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said it was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers, after a classified briefing on the strikes, argued that Mr. Trump had misled the American people about the level of success achieved.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested Monday that he could order another U.S. strike against Iran if he believes it's needed.",
      "\"If it's confirmed, they know the consequences, and the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he had heard Iran was rebuilding its capabilities after his closed-door meeting on Monday with Netanyahu, who has pressed successive U.S. administrations for decades to take a harder line against Iran.",
      "\"Netanyahu remains focused on reducing threats from Iran to Israel, which he has been for the almost 30 years he's been in office,\" CBS News national security contributor Samantha Vinograd, a former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, said Tuesday.",
      "But Vinograd added that \"the United States and Israel may have different intelligence assessments of what Iran's intentions are, what their capabilities are.\"",
      "She said the U.S. strikes over the summer \u2014 known as Operation Midnight Hammer \u2014 \"did inflict damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, however Iran does retain highly enriched uranium which could be used to breakout to a bomb.\"",
      "Vinograd said, however, the most immediate threat posed by Iran \u2014 not only to Israel but to U.S. forces in the region \u2014   may well be its massive stockpile of conventional ballistic missiles, not its potential to try to build a viable nuclear weapon.",
      "\"Iran has had more ballistic missiles than any other nation in the region, other than Israel, and it's really their leverage when it comes to wreaking havoc across the region, both against targets in Israel, American troops overseas, via proxies and more.\"",
      "\"It does appear that there is some kind of intelligence gap between what the U.S. thinks Iran is doing and capable of, and what Israeli intelligence is saying on those fronts.\"",
      "Pezeshkian said Saturday that tension between the two sides had already risen again, claiming: \"We are in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe; they don't want our country to remain stable.\"",
      "Iran has insisted it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program.",
      "U.S. intelligence agencies and the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had continued enriching uranium up to 60%, which is a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",

    "summary": "2025 was the third hottest year on record and pushed Earth past a critical climate change mark, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

    "summary": "The removal by a U.S. military cemetery in the Netherlands of two displays recognizing Black troops who fought in World War II has spurred anger there.",
    "story": [
      "Margraten, Netherlands \u2014 Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.",
      "Sometime in the spring, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside the United States, removed the panels from the visitors center at the American Cemetery in Margraten, the final resting place for roughly 8,300 U.S. soldiers, set in rolling hills near the border with Belgium and Germany.",
      "The move came after President Trump issued a series of executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. \"Our country will be woke no longer,\" he said in an address to Congress in March.",
      "The removal, carried out without public explanation, has angered Dutch officials, the families of U.S. soldiers and the local residents who honor the American sacrifice by caring for the graves.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo seemed to support the removal of the displays. \"The signs at Margraten are not intended to promote an agenda that criticizes America,\" he wrote on social media following a visit to the cemetery after the controversy had erupted. Popolo declined a request for comment.",
      "One display told the story of 23-year-old George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier buried at the cemetery, who died attempting to rescue a comrade from drowning in 1945. The other described the U.S. policy of racial segregation in place during World War II.",
      "Some 1 million Black soldiers enlisted in the U.S. military during the war, serving in separate units, mostly doing menial tasks but also fighting in some combat missions. An all-Black unit dug the thousands of graves in Margraten during the brutal 1944-45 season of famine in the German-occupied Netherlands known in the Hunger Winter.",
      "Cor Linssen, the 79-year-old son of a Black American soldier and a Dutch mother, is one of those who opposes the removal of the panels.",
      "Linssen grew up some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the cemetery and although he didn't learn who his father was until later in life, he knew he was the son of a Black soldier.",
      "\"When I was born, the nurse thought something was wrong with me because I was the wrong color,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I was the only dark child at school.\"",
      "Linssen together with a group of other children of Black soldiers, now all in their 70s and 80s, visited the cemetery in February 2025 to see the panels.",
      "\"It's an important part of history,\" Linssen said. \"They should put the panels back.\"",
      "After months of mystery around the disappearance of the panels, two media organizations - the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and online media Dutch News - this month published emails obtained through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request showing that Trump's DEI policies directly prompted the commission to take down the panels.",
      "The White House did not respond to queries from AP about the removed panels.",
      "The American Battle Monuments Commission did not respond to queries from AP about the revelations. Earlier, the ABMC told the AP that the panel that discussed segregation \"did not fall within (the) commemorative mission.''",
      "It also said that the panel about Pruitt was \"rotated\" out. The replacement panel features Leslie Loveland, a white soldier killed in Germany in 1945, who is buried at Margraten.",
      "Chair of the Black Liberators foundation and Dutch senator Theo Bovens said his organization, which pushed for the inclusion of the panels at the visitors center, was not informed that they were removed. He told AP it is \"strange\" that the U.S. commission feels the panels are not in their mission, as they placed them in 2024.",
      "\"Something has changed in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Bovens, who is from the region around Margraten, is one of thousands of locals who tend to the graves at the cemetery. People who adopt a grave visit it regularly and leave flowers on the fallen soldier's birthday and other holidays. The responsibility is often passed down through Dutch families, and there is a waiting list to adopt graves of the U.S. soldiers.",
      "Both the city and the province where the cemetery is located have demanded the panels be returned. In November, a Dutch television program recreated the panels and installed them outside the cemetery, where they were quickly removed by police. The show is now seeking a permanent location for them.",
      "The Black Liberators is also looking to find a permanent location for a memorial for the Black soldiers who gave their lives to free the Dutch.",
      "On America Square, in front of the Eijsden-Margraten city hall, there is a small park named for Jefferson Wiggins, a Black solider who, at age 19, dug many of the graves at Margraten when he was stationed in the Netherlands.",
      "In his memoir, published posthumously in 2014, he describes burying the bodies of his white comrades who he was barred from fraternizing with while they were alive.",
      "When Black soldiers came to Europe in the Second World War, ''what they found was people who accepted them, who welcomed them, who treated them as the heroes that they were. And that includes the Netherlands,\u2033 said Linda Hervieux, whose book \"Forgotten\" chronicles Black soldiers who fought on D-Day and segregation they faced back home.",
      "The removal of the panels, she said, \"follows a historical pattern of writing out the stories of men and women of color in the United States.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday that Hamas must disarm soon or \"there will be hell to pay.\" He said the next phase of the Gaza peace plan could move forward quickly if Hamas disarms.",
      "Standing alongside Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, Mr. Trump also claimed dozens of other countries that supported the peace deal are ready to \"wipe out\" the terrorist group if Hamas doesn't disarm, but he did not name any of them.",
      "The president said of Hamas, \"They're going to be given a very short period of time to disarm.\" Standing alongside Netanyahu, Mr. Trump added, \"And we'll see how that works out. Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be in charge of that, from our side. But if they don't disarm, as they agreed to do \u2014 they agreed to it \u2014 then there will be hell to pay for them. And we don't want that. We're not looking for that. But they have to disarm within a fairly short period of time.\"",
      "\"We have 59 countries that signed on, big countries, countries that are outside of the Middle East as you know the Middle East,\" the president added. \"They want to go in and wipe out Hamas. They don't want Israel, they don't need Israel; they want to do it because it's the right thing to do. Because they were for the deal, based on the fact that Hamas pledged, they swore, that they were going to disarm. Now, if they're not going to disarm, those same countries will wipe out Hamas.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Netanyahu still don't agree completely on the West Bank.",
      "Netanyahu said he had a \"very, very productive meeting\" with the president, and he thanked him for his partnership. He told reporters Mr. Trump would receive the Israel Prize, the most prestigious award in Israel, for his work on the peace negotiations.",
      "\"We've never awarded it to a non-Israeli,\" Netanyahu told reporters. \"And we're going to award it this year to President Trump.\"",
      "Ahead of the meeting, Mr. Trump said the second phase of the peace plan could begin \"as quickly as we can,\" but \"there has to be a disarmament\" of Hamas.",
      "The first phase of the peace plan called for an immediate ceasefire, as well as the return of all hostages and the provision of humanitarian aid.",
      "But the second phase \u2014 which entails the terrorist group's disarmament, the effective end of Hamas' rule and its replacement by a transitional governance entity \u2014 has not yet been implemented. Hamas has refused to disarm and has not yet returned all Israeli hostage remains, while Israel has recently conducted some strikes in Gaza. The family of Israeli Sgt. Maj. Ran Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose remains have not yet been returned, was at Mar-a-Lago Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump also said ahead of the meeting that he would support an Israeli attack on Iran, should Iran begin again to build up its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The president praised Netanyahu, telling reporters \"he's a wartime prime minister who's a hero.\" And the president said he has spoken with Israeli President Isaac Herzog about a pardon for Netanyahu, who is facing bribery and fraud charges.",
      "\"How do you not give a pardon, you know?\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think it's a very hard thing not to do it. ... He tells me it's on its way.\"",
      "Herzog's office, however, said in a statement, \"There has not been a conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted.\" The statement also said that Herzog spoke several weeks ago with a representative of Mr. Trump who had \"inquired about the U.S. President's letter\" and who was told \"any decision on the matter will be made in accordance with the established procedures.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Netanyahu ahead of Mr. Trump's meeting. Netanyahu's visit comes a week after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, met with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss next steps in the peace plan.",
      "The Israel-Hamas ceasefire went into effect in November, more than two years after the war began with the attack by Hamas-led terrorists on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.",
      "This was the sixth meeting between Mr. Trump and Netanyahu since the president took office in January.",
      "Netanyahu's visit came on the heels of Mr. Trump's\u00a0meeting\u00a0Sunday at Mar-a-Lago with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the U.S. president continues to try to to broker a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. After that meeting, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy said they're nearly in agreement on a peace plan for Ukraine, and the Ukrainian leader praised what he called \"strong security guarantees\" from the U.S. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Mr. Trump spoke before and after his meeting with Zelenskyy, hasn't shown a willingness to compromise on his territorial demands. Russia attacked Kyiv shortly before Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump has been spending the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago estate, mixing in golf with meetings with world leaders. The president will return to the White House after New Year's Day.",

      "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are facing another round of staff departures.",
      "It was confirmed on Dec. 26 that the couple's chief communications officer, Meredith Maines, would be stepping down from her position after officially starting work with them in March. Just a few days later, their longtime advisor, James Holt, announced he would be leaving his role as executive director of Archewell on Dec. 29.",
      "News of their departures comes after three communications staffers \u2014 Charlie Gipson, Kyle Boulia and Emily Robinson \u2014 also resigned earlier this year. Their global press secretary, Ashley Hansen, previously stepped down last year to start her own agency after working with the couple for two years.",
      "\"In virtually any context\u2014other than the final months of an outgoing administration\u2014losing five senior-level comms advisors inside of a year is a bit abnormal,\" Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, told Fox News Digital.",

      "He continued: \"It\u2019s unclear whether it was due to budgetary constraints within Archewell\u2014as has been alluded to in other articles and sources\u2014or merely a consolidation plan that realigns strategic direction from the UK, or whether it was merely the conclusion of a predetermined engagement. What hasn\u2019t been indicated, or inferred, is that any of the aforementioned advisors either quit or were terminated.\"",
      "According to Eldridge, the signs of \"a successful strategic communications team and plan are: clarity, continuity, and execution,\" which in turn bring stability, something he says \"is hard to maintain...when your comms team has become a revolving door over the last 12 months.\"",
      "Royal photographer, Helena Chard, joked that it feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with Harry and Meghan this time of year, as \"the unusual high staff turnover merry-go-round continues,\" while also sharing a potential reason for Maines' departure.",
      "\"Allegedly, the Kris Jenner birthday party controversy contributed to Meredith Maines' decision to leave. She, along with the communications team, has faced scrutiny over media relations handling and public perception,\" Chard told Fox News Digital.",
      "One expert suggests the controversy surrounding Kris Jenner's birthday led to Maines' exit. (Karwai Tang/WireImage)",
      "\"Maines is a highly respected communications professional and, without doubt, will be protecting her reputation from the Sussex\u2019s possible damaging erratic behavior,\" she continued. \"A communications strategy only works if all parties adhere to the plan.\"",
      "Harry and Meghan attended Jenner's birthday party at Jeff Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez Bezos' Beverly Hills home in November. Both Kim Kardashian and Jenner posted photos of the couple at the party on Instagram, with the two of them later taking their posts down.",
      "Chard also speaks to there being \"a distinct lack of clarity\" in their messaging, noting that \"there should be a focus on consistency and credibility for success.\"",
      "\"There are murmurs of Meghan and Harry not following advice given by experts,\" Chard adds. \"Hiring top experts is essential to things running successfully. Everyone has their strengths and one would hope that Meghan and Harry have learned that they do not always know best!\"",

      "NEW CLAIMS EMERGE ABOUT PRINCE HARRY, MEGHAN MARKLE MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHING FROM KARDASHIAN SOCIAL MEDIA",
      "Royal commentator Hilary Fordwich refers to the new round of departures as \"undeniable confirmation\" that Harry and Meghan are \"are unmanageably high\u2011maintenance and hypocritical at best,\" calling them \"the common denominator\u00a0here in this dysfunctional situation.\"",
      "\"There is no other logical explanation as this is far from business as usual, it\u2019s neither calm nor coherent,\" Fordwich added. \"Harking back to their royal legacy of the \u2018Sussex Survivors Club\u2019, coined by former Palace staff\u00a0describing their trauma from bullying allegations after working for the couple, believing, only half-jokingly, they suffered from a form of post-traumatic stress.\"",
      "Fordwich explained that people in those positions usually stick around for three to five years, with most departures happening because of \"mergers, scandals, or change of leadership,\" with exceptions being \"start-ups or companies in crisis mode,\" adding \"such tumultuous turnovers signal either the principals are ghastly to work with and for, and/or the company is shrinking, or both.\"",
      "She also contrasted the level of turnover in Harry and Meghan's staff to Prince William and Kate Middleton, whose senior communications staff worked with the couple for years, adding this continuity \"is facilitated by established protocols and clear institutional hierarchies.\"",

      "Eldridge and Chard also focused on the media attention the departures are bringing the couple, adding that \"paradoxically, it creates the very type of headlines they wanted to avoid in the first place.\"",
      "He explained that now that they don't have a team to \"plant headlines on your behalf,\" the public is now more focused on \"why your senior comms advisors are leaving in droves.\"",
      "\"The UK 'audience' (I\u2019m not sure she has a demonstrable fan base over there) are markedly more vicious, at least by American tabloid standards,\" Eldridge said. \"Here in the U.S., the presumption\u2014whether right or wrong\u2014will be that she is difficult to work with and that\u2019s why so many experienced, senior comms leaders are exiting faster than a \"10 items or less\" line at the checkout. Neither conclusion will benefit Markle.\"",

      "\"What this will do henceforth is to limit the caliber of professionals willing to work for Harry and Meghan Markle,\" Fordwich said. \"Top notch professionals don\u2019t either want to nor need to enter into such a volatile situation with no sustainability, let alone a contracting versus expanding philanthropic entity with strategy confusion and a ghastly incoherent track-record to date.\"",

For people who repeatedly promise themselves this will be the year they quit whatever they might be addicted to \u2014 and keep falling short \u2014 Dr. Drew said during an interview with Fox News Digital that the issue is often the belief that willpower alone is enough.",

      "\"The brain consumes around 20% of your body\u2019s energy and has high demand for NAD+ for cellular energy production and DNA repair,\" Brenner, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"This is because NAD+ plays a key role in the way that neurons adapt to a range of physiological stressors and support processes associated with brain health.\"",

      "Maelee Wells Sutton, a certified personal trainer at Crunch Fitness in New York, previously told Fox News Digital it's \"no surprise\" that higher-intensity running burns calories faster. \"Walking at 12-3-30 is certainly more intense than walking on a flat surface, but is less intense than a run,\" she noted.",

      "\"How I've gotten to the point I am right now has been very, very, very baby steps. So, the first thing is morning jumping \u2026 What I do when I get out of bed, my feet touch the ground, I jump 50 times.\"",

      "A whiskey sour for the distilled spirits industry.",

      "TARIFFS PUSH US WINE INDUSTRY INTO UNCERTAIN TERRITORY: 'REALLY CREATES A CHALLENGE'",
      "\"Bourbon is Kentucky, right? We love horse racing in Kentucky. We love bourbon in Kentucky. It's the reason that 2.7 million people come to visit the Commonwealth every single year,\" said Coffey. \"It\u2019s some of the biggest news to come out of Kentucky in quite some time, and this is one of the most iconic brands in bourbon.\"",
      "Not everyone has heard of Willett or Four Roses when it comes to bourbon. But Jim Beam is Americana. Ubiquitous. Kind of like McDonald\u2019s or Coke.",
      "Americans are imbibing less \u2014 down 6% from just two years ago. And more than 16 million barrels of Kentucky spirits \u2014 including bourbon and rye \u2014 are aging in warehouses across the state. Distillers are paying taxes on those barrels while they age.",
      "It\u2019s an issue of supply and demand. But the problem is not exclusive to Jim Beam.",
      "\"It's not a question of who's shutting down production,\" said Charlie Prince, who runs the Drammers Whiskey Club. \"It's a question of who is admitting it.\"",
      "Barrels of bourbon are stacked in a barrel house at the Jim Beam Distillery Feb. 17, 2020 in Clermont, Ky. U.S. whiskey exports have fallen by 27% to the European Union, the product's largest export market, caused by retaliatory tariffs imposed by the 27-nation alliance, a trade group said last week. (Bryan Woolston/Getty Images)",
      "Overseas distillers like Midleton in Ireland, which makes Jameson, and Highland Park in Scotland all reduced production recently because of a glut of bourbon, whiskey and Scotch on the market.",
      "However, observers say tariffs and the trade war with Canada hit Jim Beam especially hard.",
      "\"Ten percent of Kentucky bourbon sales were going to Canada, and that has dropped to almost zero,\" said Prince. \"In Canada, that has been taken on as a kind of a national mission for Canadians, saying, \u2018Let's buy Canadian\u2019 and push back against the politics they don't like coming from the U.S. And, so, you see stores just pulling all American products and banning them in some provinces. So, that's definitely a political response.\"",
      "Democrats quickly latched onto the tariff argument.",
      "\"Thousands of Kentuckians power the bourbon industry. We will all feel the impact of this,\" declared Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky. \"It\u2019s hard to overstate just how devastating Trump\u2019s tariffs are for America\u2019s signature spirit.\"",
      "RECORD LOW NUMBER OF AMERICANS REPORT DRINKING ALCOHOL, AND NEW TEETOTALERS ARE EXPLAINING WHY",

      "\"Anybody that tells you that they have an explanation, \u2018Oh, it's tariffs,\u2019 or 'Oh, it's post-pandemic retraction,\u2019 is giving you a too simplistic explanation,\" said Spector. \"It's unclear what impact the tariffs are having and will have in the future. People have argued over tariffs for a long time. As long as there has been trade, there have been arguments over tariffs. It's unclear whether the tariffs are sort of the coup de gras to an industry that was already suffering.\"",
      "Spector says yes, Generation Z drinks less and uses cannabis more. There are also health concerns. But the spirits industry has witnessed shifts before. She says people moved from brown liquor to vodka in the 1970s because it was seen as healthier.",
      "\"They also jogged more and did a lot more cocaine because that was seen as more health conscious. So, it gets really complicated when you break things down generationally,\" said Spector.",
      "But the tariffs remain extraordinarily controversial. The Trump administration says tariffs are here to stay.",

      "\"Tariffs are going to be part of the policy landscape,\" United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Fox. \"We know they\u2019re successful.\"",
      "But the tariffs may also evaporate.",
      "The Constitution grants Congress the authority to tax and impose tariffs. President Trump used emergency powers to levy global tariffs earlier this year. That\u2019s why this issue wound up at the Supreme Court. Attorneys argued the case in October.",
      "\"Canada is one of our closest allies. I think it would be hard to find Canada engaging in unfair trade practices because we have what used to be called the NAFTA agreement, between Canada, the United States and Mexico to bring down all the trade barriers between the countries,\" said University of California law professor John Yoo.",
      "Based on the oral arguments, Yoo believes the high court will halt the Trump-imposed tariffs under the premise that the U.S. faces a national emergency.",
      "\"Canada will immediately benefit, and you'll be able to find your choice of American bourbons on Canadian store shelves,\" said Yoo.",
      "FREEDOM AND FACTS, NOT FEAR, SHOULD FRAME AMERICA'S CHOICES ON ALCOHOL",
      "In fact, Yoo believes the Supreme Court could issue its ruling sooner rather than later \u2014 especially if it nixes the tariffs. That\u2019s because of all the duties and fees that might be levied on products for months \u2014 and then reversed.",
      "It\u2019s important to note that Jim Beam will continue operating two other distilleries for the time being. And Spector says Generation Z prefers cocktails. So, that could force the industry to shift what it produces.",
      "Now here\u2019s a little tidbit you probably won\u2019t learn any place else.",
      "Roam any distillery in Scotland, be it Dalwhinnie in the Highlands, Glen Scotia in Campbeltown, GlenGrant in Speyside or Bowmore on Islay, and you will find distillers aging Scotch in Jim Beam barrels.",
      "It\u2019s not just Jim Beam barrels that you will find in Scotland. It\u2019s also Buffalo Trace. Heaven Hill. Woodford Reserve. Wild Turkey. Congress only allows American distillers to use American oak barrels once for producing bourbon. So, Scotch distillers overseas love to get their hands on a good bourbon barrel to age their spirit.",
      "The barrels may partially impart a vanilla flavor into the expression, stemming from \"vanillans\" in the wood.",
      "The Jim Beam Distillery Feb. 17, 2020, in Clermont, Ky. \u00a0 (Bryan Woolston/Getty Images)",
      "The trend of using American bourbon barrels for Scotch began in the 1940s after the U.S. market came back online following the end of Prohibition. Distillers in Scotland began using sherry barrels to age their spirits prior to that (hence, the rich meaty flavors you get from Macallan). Sherry is still prevalent despite a decline in people consuming sherry these days. But fewer bourbon barrels from a big producer like Jim Beam now could alter the taste of Scotch in about 15 to 20 years.",
      "That said, demand for Scotch is down like bourbon. So, some of these may even out.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that Suntory Global Spirits owns Jim Beam. It was known as Beam Suntory until recently. Suntory also owns major Scotch labels like Bowmore, Admore, Laphroaig, Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch. The pipeline of barrels from Jim Beam was a good proposition for Suntory to age Scotch.",
      "So, it\u2019s possible that, down the road, Scotch distillers may age some of their expressions in barrels that once contained something else \u2014 other than Kentucky bourbon. And that\u2019s where the flavor profile will evolve.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "It\u2019s also impossible to know the market trends and what people will be interested in drinking in 15 to 20 years. And, so, whatever distillers put into a barrel now might not match market trends in the future.",
      "In fact, perhaps people will revert to drinking bourbon and Scotch. And the market glut now may switch into a spirits famine where products consumers want are hard to find.",

      "\"President Trump decided to veto a completely non-controversial, bipartisan bill that passed both the House and Senate unanimously. Why? Because nothing says \u2018America First\u2019 like denying clean drinking water to 50,000 people in Southeast Colorado many of whom enthusiastically voted for him all three elections,\" Boebert said in a statement posted by journalist Kyle Clarke.",

      "\"I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability Americans deserve leadership that puts people over politics,\" Boebert said.",

      "Boebert has also been a vocal Trump ally in her own right but did not mince words in her displeasure over the veto.",
      "\"I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects. My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape,\" Boebert said.",

It would have also extended the repayment period for the project to 100 years.",
      "As noted by Boebert, the bill passed without objection in the House of Representatives in a unanimous voice vote back in July.",
      "In its own statement on the matter, the White House said it had vetoed the bill because it would force the federal government to pick up more of the bill for a state and local project authorized by previous administrations.",

But 2025 also made clear why the war has proven so resistant to resolution: neither battlefield pressure, economic sanctions nor intensified diplomacy were enough to force Moscow or Kyiv into concessions they were unwilling to make.",

      "By the end of 2025, the diplomatic track had narrowed around a more defined \u2014 but still contested \u2014 framework.

      "Zelenskyy has publicly signaled openness to elements of the framework while insisting that any agreement must include robust, long-term security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. Ukrainian officials have also made clear that questions surrounding occupied territory, including parts of the Donbas, cannot be resolved solely through ceasefire lines without broader guarantees.",
      "Russia, however, has not agreed to the proposal. Moscow has continued to insist on recognition of its territorial claims and has resisted terms that would constrain its military posture or require meaningful concessions. Russian officials have at times linked their negotiating stance to developments on the battlefield, reinforcing the Kremlin\u2019s view that leverage \u2014 not urgency \u2014 should dictate the pace of talks.",

Russian forces continued pushing for incremental gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, particularly along axes tied to Moscow\u2019s long-stated objective of consolidating control over territory it claims as Russian.",
      "Russian advances were measured and costly, often unfolding village by village through artillery-heavy assaults and sustained drone use rather than sweeping offensives. While Moscow failed to capture major new cities or trigger a collapse in Ukrainian defenses, it expanded control in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine, maintaining pressure across multiple fronts and keeping territorial questions central to both the fighting and any future negotiations.",

      "Ukraine, for its part, did not mount a large-scale counteroffensive in 2025 comparable to earlier phases of the war. Ukrainian forces achieved localized tactical successes, at times reclaiming small areas or reversing specific Russian advances, but these gains were limited in scope and often temporary. None translated into a sustained territorial breakthrough capable of altering the broader balance of the front.",
      "Instead, Kyiv focused on preventing further losses, reinforcing defensive lines and imposing costs on Russian forces through precision strikes and asymmetric tactics. With decisive territorial gains out of reach, Ukraine expanded attacks against Russian energy infrastructure, targeting refineries, fuel depots and other hubs critical to sustaining Moscow\u2019s war effort \u2014 including sites deep inside Russian territory.",

The result was a widening pattern of horizontal escalation, as both sides sought leverage beyond the front lines without achieving a decisive military outcome.",
      "The result was a battlefield stalemate with movement at the margins: Russia advanced just enough to sustain its territorial claims and domestic narrative, while Ukraine proved capable of blunting assaults and imposing costs but not of reclaiming large swaths of occupied land. The fighting underscored a central reality of 2025 \u2014 territory still mattered deeply to both sides, but neither possessed the military leverage needed to force a decisive shift.",

      "On the battlefield, Russia continued to absorb losses while pressing for incremental territorial gains, reinforcing Moscow\u2019s belief that time remained on its side. Ukrainian forces, though increasingly strained, succeeded in preventing a collapse and in imposing costs through deep strikes and attacks on Russia\u2019s energy infrastructure \u2014 demonstrating an ability to shape the conflict even without major territorial advances.",
      "Economic pressure also reshaped \u2014 but did not determine \u2014 Moscow\u2019s calculus. Despite years of Western sanctions, Russia continued financing its war effort in 2025, ramping up defense production and adapting its economy to sustain prolonged conflict. While sanctions constrained growth and access to advanced technology, they raised the long-term costs of the war without producing the immediate pressure needed to force President Vladimir Putin toward concessions.",

      "The nonpartisan healthcare think tank painted a broader picture of the disparate impact on premium cost increases in a report released late last month that, based on myriad factors, including where a person lives, their age range and where they sit above the poverty line, some could see price hikes as high as 361%.",

      "We could not let 2025 end without one last reminder about digital safety. Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming. You do not need advanced skills or expensive tools. With a few smart habits, you can lower your risk and protect your digital life throughout 2026. To help you start the year strong, here are 10 simple cybersecurity resolutions that actually work.",

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "6) Consider identity theft protection",
      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",

      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS",
      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

      "A new phishing campaign is exploiting a visual trick that is easy to miss and hard to unsee once you know it. Attackers are using the domain rnicrosoft.com to impersonate Microsoft and steal login credentials. The trick is simple. Instead of the letter m, scammers place r and n side by side. In many fonts, those letters blur together and look almost identical to an m at a quick glance.",
      "Security experts are sounding the alarm because this tactic works. These emails closely copy Microsoft branding, layout and tone, which makes them feel familiar and trustworthy. That false sense of legitimacy is often all it takes to get a quick click before you realize something is wrong.",

      "Cybersecurity experts warn of a new phishing scam that uses the fake domain rnicrosoft.com to mimic Microsoft and steal login credentials. (Photo by Oliver Berg/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why your brain falls for the rn trick",
      "This attack relies on how people read. Your brain predicts words instead of scanning each letter. When something looks familiar, you fill in the gaps automatically. On a large desktop monitor, a careful reader might spot the flaw. On a phone, the risk jumps. The address bar often shortens URLs, and the screen leaves little room for close inspection. That is exactly where attackers want you. Once trust is established, you are more likely to enter passwords, approve fake invoices or download harmful attachments.",
      "Common typosquatting variations to watch for",
      "Attackers rarely rely on a single trick. They mix several visual deceptions to increase their odds.",

      "microsoft.coUses a different domain ending to appear real",
      "What attackers do after you click",
      "Typosquatting domains like rnicrosoft.com are rarely used for a single purpose. Criminals reuse them across multiple scams. Common follow-ups include\u00a0credential phishing, fake HR notices and vendor payment requests. In every case, the attacker benefits from speed. The faster you act, the less likely you are to notice the mistake.",
      "Why these fake domains keep working",
      "Most people do not slow down to read URLs character by character. Familiar logos and language reinforce trust, especially during a busy workday. Mobile use makes this worse. Smaller screens, shortened links and constant notifications create perfect conditions for mistakes. This is not a Microsoft-only problem. Banks, retailers, healthcare portals and government services all face the same risk.",
      "How to stay safe from typosquatting attacks",
      "Typosquatting scams work because they rush you into trusting what looks familiar. These steps slow that moment down and help you spot fake domains before damage is done.",
      "Before clicking anything, open the full sender address in the email header. Display names and logos are easy to fake, but domains tell the real story. Look closely for swapped letters like rn in place of m, added hyphens or strange domain endings. If the address feels even slightly off, treat the message as hostile.",

      "On a desktop, hover your mouse over links to reveal the real destination. On a phone, long-press the link to preview the URL. This simple pause often exposes lookalike domains designed to steal logins. If the link does not match the exact site you expect, do not proceed.",
      "When an email claims your account needs urgent action, do not use its links. Instead, open a new browser tab and manually go to the official website using a saved bookmark. Legitimate companies do not require you to act through surprise links, and this habit cuts off most typosquatting attempts instantly.",
      "Strong antivirus software can block known phishing domains, flag malicious downloads and warn you before you enter credentials on risky sites. While it cannot catch every new typo trick, it adds an important safety net when human attention slips.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

Lawmakers, educators and child safety advocates want proof that AI companies can protect young users.

      "OpenAI announced tougher safety rules for teen users as pressure grows on tech companies to prove AI can protect young people online. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What OpenAI's new teen rules actually say",
      "OpenAI's updated Model Spec builds on existing safety limits and applies to teen users ages 13 to 17. It continues to block sexual content involving minors and discourages self-harm, delusions and manic behavior. For teens, the rules go further. The models must avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and violent or sexual roleplay, even when non-graphic. They must use extra caution when discussing body image and eating behaviors. When safety risks appear, the chatbot should prioritize protection over user autonomy. It should also avoid giving advice that helps teens hide risky behavior from caregivers. These limits apply even if a prompt is framed as fictional, historical, or educational.",
      "The four principles OpenAI says it uses to protect teens",
      "OpenAI says its approach to teen users follows four core principles:",

      "The company updated its chatbot guidelines for users ages 13 to 17 and launched new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Teens are driving the AI safety debate",
      "Gen Z users are among the most active chatbot users today. Many rely on AI for homework help, creative projects and emotional support. OpenAI's recent deal with Disney could draw even more young users to the platform. That growing popularity has also brought scrutiny. Recently, attorneys general from 42 states urged major tech companies to add stronger safeguards for children and vulnerable users. At the federal level, proposed legislation could go even further. Some lawmakers want to block minors from using AI chatbots entirely.",
      "Why experts question whether AI safety rules work",
      "Despite the updates, many experts remain cautious. One major concern is engagement. Advocates argue chatbots often encourage prolonged interaction, which can become addictive for teens. Refusing certain requests could help break that cycle. Still, critics warn that examples in policy documents are not proof of consistent behavior. Past versions of the Model Spec banned excessive agreeableness, yet models continued mirroring users in harmful ways. Some experts link this behavior to what they call AI psychosis, where chatbots reinforce distorted thinking instead of challenging it.",
      "In one widely reported case, a teenager who later died by suicide spent months interacting with a chatbot. Conversation logs showed repeated mirroring and validation of distress. Internal systems flagged hundreds of messages related to self-harm. Yet the interactions continued. Former safety researchers later explained that earlier moderation systems reviewed content after the fact rather than in real time. That allowed harmful conversations to continue unchecked. OpenAI says it now uses real-time classifiers across text, images, and audio. When systems detect serious risk, trained reviewers may step in, and parents may be notified.",
      "Some advocates praise OpenAI for publicly sharing its under-18 guidelines. Many tech companies do not offer that level of transparency. Still, experts stress that written rules are not enough. What matters is how the system behaves during real conversations with vulnerable users. Without independent measurement and clear enforcement data, critics say these updates remain promises rather than proof.",
      "How parents can help teens use AI safely",
      "OpenAI says parents play a key role in helping teens use AI responsibly. The company stresses that tools alone are not enough. Active guidance matters most.",
      "OpenAI encourages regular conversations between parents and teens about how AI fits into daily life. These discussions should focus on responsible use and critical thinking. Parents are urged to remind teens that AI responses are not facts and can be wrong.",
      "OpenAI provides parental controls that let adults manage how teens interact with AI tools. These tools can limit features and add oversight. The company says safeguards are designed to reduce exposure to higher-risk topics and unsafe interactions. Here are the steps OpenAI recommends parents take.",

      "Parents are encouraged to ask what teens use AI for, when they use it and how it makes them feel. These conversations can reveal unhealthy patterns early.",
      "Experts advise parents to look for increased isolation, emotional reliance on AI or treating chatbot responses as authority. These can signal unhealthy dependence.",

Another option sends 6-digit verification codes by text message through SMS or WhatsApp, depending on the country code. Enabling multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond a password and helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to teen accounts.",
      "Also, consider adding a strong antivirus software that can help block malicious links, fake downloads, and other threats teens may encounter while using AI tools. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond any single app or platform.\u00a0 Using strong antivirus protection and two-factor authentication together helps reduce the risk of account takeovers that could expose teens to unsafe content or impersonation risks.",

Still, policies on paper are not the same as behavior in real conversations. For teens who rely on AI every day, what matters most is how these systems respond in moments of stress, confusion, or vulnerability. That is where trust is built or lost. For parents, this moment calls for balance. AI tools can be helpful and creative. They also require guidance, boundaries, and supervision. No set of controls can replace real conversations or human support. As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, the focus must stay on outcomes, not intentions. Protecting teens will depend on consistent enforcement, independent oversight, and active family involvement.",

      "Kurt 'The Cyber Guy' Knutsson shares his tips and tricks to avoid holiday shopping scams this winter season on 'Fox Report.'",
      "Data breaches tied to financial services companies are no longer rare, but they still hit harder when Social Security numbers are involved. In the latest incident, U.S.-based fintech company 700Credit has confirmed that the personal data of more than 5.8 million people was exposed. The breach did not originate from a direct compromise of 700Credit's internal network, which makes it more concerning. It began with a third-party integration partner and quietly snowballed over several months before it was detected. By the time the issue was contained, hackers had managed to steal a significant amount of sensitive consumer data.",

      "A data breach at fintech firm 700Credit exposed the personal information of more than 5.8 million people after hackers accessed data through a third-party vendor. (Photo by Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What went wrong at 700Credit",
      "The company says the breach traces back to July, when a threat actor compromised one of its third-party integration partners, as reported by Bleeping Computer. During that intrusion, the attacker discovered an exposed API that could be used to access customer information linked to 700Credit's dealership clients. The integration partner failed to inform 700Credit about the compromise, allowing the access to continue unnoticed.",
      "Suspicious activity was only detected on October 25, when 700Credit flagged unusual behavior on its systems and launched an internal investigation. The company says it brought in third-party computer forensic specialists to assess the scope of the incident and determine what data had been affected.",
      "According to the company's findings, certain records within its web application were copied without authorization. These records are related to customers of auto dealerships that use 700Credit's services. Managing Director Ken Hill later confirmed that roughly 20% of the consumer data accessible through the affected system was stolen between May and October.",
      "What data was exposed and why it matters",
      "While 700Credit has not published an exhaustive list of every data field involved, the company has confirmed that highly sensitive personal information was exposed. This includes Social Security numbers, which significantly raises the risk of identity theft and financial fraud. When SSNs are compromised, the impact is long-term. You cannot simply change them like a password.",
      "The company has published a dedicated page on its website outlining the breach and the types of information impacted. As part of its response, 700Credit is offering affected individuals 12 months of free identity protection and credit monitoring through TransUnion. You have a 90-day window to enroll in this service after receiving the notification.",
      "Notably, audio streaming platform SoundCloud and adult video sharing platform Pornhub also suffered data breaches tied to third-party vendors. There is no indication that the same vendor was involved in all three incidents, but the cases highlight how risky third-party access can be when vendors handle sensitive consumer data.",
      "CyberGuy reached out to 700Credit for comment but did not receive a response before publication.",

      "A good antivirus helps block malicious downloads, phishing links and spyware that often follow large data leaks. Attackers know your details are exposed and may try to target you directly with malware-based scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If you are still reusing passwords, this is the time to stop. A password manager helps you generate strong, unique passwords for every service and keeps them stored securely. If one site is breached, the rest of your accounts stay protected.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Turn on\u00a02FA\u00a0for email, banking, social media and cloud accounts. Even if someone has your password, they cannot log in without the second factor. App-based authenticators are more secure than SMS, where possible.",
      "Monitoring services alert you when new accounts, loans or credit checks appear in your name. Early alerts give you a chance to act before serious financial damage is done.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "Hackers quietly accessed consumer data tied to auto dealerships using 700Credit services before the breach was discovered in October. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Your phone number, address and other details are often already scattered across data broker sites. Data removal services help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for attackers to profile and target you after a breach.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Third-party APIs and integrations are essential for modern digital services, but they also expand the attack surface. When third-party partners fail to disclose breaches quickly, the downstream impact can be massive, as this case shows. If you receive a notification from 700Credit, take it seriously. Enroll in the credit monitoring service, review your credit reports, and consider locking them down. Even if no fraud has occurred yet, breaches involving SSNs often lead to delayed abuse months or even years later.",

      "FOX Business correspondent Max Gorden explains how Happy Returns is using artificial intelligence to audit legitimacy of customer returns on \u2018America Reports.\u2019",
      "Data from Happy Returns, a UPS-owned reverse logistics company, shows that nearly one in every 10 retail returns in the United States involves fraud. Retailers now lose an estimated $76.5 billion a year to the problem.",
      "To slow those losses, Happy Returns, which specializes in boxless in-store returns for online purchases, is testing a new artificial intelligence tool that flags fraudulent returns before refunds go out.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW IPHONE SCAM TRICKS OWNERS INTO GIVING PHONES AWAY",
      "Return fraud is costing U.S. retailers billions, with nearly 1 in 10 returns flagged as suspicious, according to data from Happy Returns. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",
      "How return fraud works in the real world",
      "Return fraud often looks harmless on the surface. A shopper requests a refund for a legitimate item. Instead of sending back the real product, they ship something cheaper, damaged or completely different. Retailers often issue refunds before anyone inspects the item. That speed allows fraud to slip through and drives up costs.",
      "Industry data from Happy Returns and the National Retail Federation shows retailers will handle nearly $850 billion in returned goods in 2025, representing almost 16% of total retail sales. According to the same research, an estimated 9% of those returns are fraudulent. The report also finds that many shoppers admit to some form of return policy abuse. Importantly, because Happy Returns conducts in-person item verification and uses AI-powered automated flagging plus audit processes to catch mismatches, the rate of confirmed fraud in its network is much lower than the industry-wide estimate.",
      "Why boxless returns changed the equation",
      "Happy Returns operates nearly 8,000 in-person return drop-off locations inside stores such as Ulta Beauty and Staples, as well as at UPS locations. Shoppers can return eligible items without a box or shipping label, and refunds are often issued quickly after verification. Like any returns channel, fraud attempts can happen, but in-person drop-off, item verification, ongoing flagging and audits help keep confirmed fraud far lower than broader industry averages.",
      "Happy Returns says its boxless, in-person model already blocks many common fraud tactics, including empty boxes, partial returns and fake tracking numbers.\u00a0\"If you never touch the product, you can't actually know what's being returned matches what was sold,\" the company says. Everlane says that physical handling alone acts as a deterrent. \"Just the fact of knowing an individual will physically handle and verify the product at the Return Bar deters fraudsters from even attempting to commit fraud,\" said Jim Green, director of logistics and fulfillment at Everlane.",
      "Still, Happy Returns acknowledges that fraud tactics continue to evolve. Lookalike products and knockoffs can closely resemble the real thing, making subtle differences hard to spot without close inspection.",
      "THE FAKE REFUND SCAM: WHY SCAMMERS LOVE HOLIDAY SHOPPERS",
      "Happy Returns is testing a new artificial intelligence system designed to flag fraudulent retail returns before refunds are issued. (Photo By Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post via Getty Images)",
      "How Return Vision uses AI to detect fraudulent returns",
      "This holiday season, Happy Returns is piloting its new AI system with select retailers, including Everlane, Revolve and Under Armour, as return volumes spike.",
      "The new AI tool is called Return Vision. It starts working the moment a shopper initiates a return online. The system looks for unusual patterns across return timing, frequency and location. A single return may appear normal on its own. When those signals overlap in suspicious ways, the return is flagged for review before a refund is issued.",
      "At drop-off points, workers can scan item barcodes and see photos of what the item should look like. They can reject obvious mismatches on the spot. Once returns reach Happy Returns hubs in California, Pennsylvania and Mississippi, flagged packages are sent to human auditors. The items are opened and photographed, including images of the front, back and identifying labels.",
      "Those photos are fed back into the AI system, which compares them against official product images and past transaction data. Human teams review the AI assessment and make the final decision. The goal is not automation alone. It is adding multiple layers of review where fraud is harder to hide.",
      "Early results show how effective AI is at catching return fraud",
      "While still in pilot, Happy Returns says Return Vision is showing early results. Less than 1% of returns flowing through its network are flagged as high risk. Of those flagged returns, about 10% are ultimately confirmed as fraud. The average prevented loss per confirmed case is just over $200.",
      "Happy Returns says the system focuses on high-confidence cases, allowing most shoppers to move through returns without delay. The company notes that the tool does not address every form of abuse, such as wardrobing, when customers return worn items.",

      "Boxless, in-person returns are helping retailers cut down on common fraud tactics like empty boxes and fake tracking numbers. (Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why retailers are turning to AI to stop return fraud",
      "Happy Returns is not alone in turning to AI to stop return fraud. Amazon and FedEx both offer boxless returns and use automated systems to flag risky behavior. The U.S. Postal Service is rolling out similar services. Across retail, 85% of surveyed merchants say they use AI or machine learning to combat fraud. Many say the results have been mixed. Happy Returns says combining behavioral signals with physical product verification helps close gaps that data-only systems often miss.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Retail returns have changed, and so has the fraud that comes with them. Easy drop-offs and instant refunds made life better for shoppers, but they also created new vulnerabilities. Happy Returns is betting that AI, combined with hands-on inspection, can tip the balance back toward retailers. Early results suggest it can help, even if it is not a cure-all. As fraudsters adapt, retailers are learning they have to adapt faster.",

That earlier breach occurred after a\u00a0smishing attack gave threat actors access to Mixpanel systems. However, Mixpanel says it does not believe Pornhub data came from that incident. The company stated it found no evidence that the data was taken during its November 2025 breach. Pornhub has also clarified that it stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021. That means the stolen data would be several years old. Reuters contacted some Pornhub customers to verify the claims. Those users confirmed the data tied to their accounts was accurate but outdated, which aligns with the Mixpanel timeline.",

      "Apple Music is now available as an app inside ChatGPT, and it changes how people discover and organize music. Instead of scrolling through endless playlists, you can ask ChatGPT to create one using natural language. For example, you can request a holiday mix without overplayed songs or ask it to find a track you only half remember. ChatGPT searches Apple Music and builds the playlist for you. This integration does not stream full songs inside ChatGPT. It helps Apple Music subscribers find music, create playlists and discover artists faster, then links back to Apple Music for listening. ChatGPT can also activate Apple Music automatically based on your request, so you do not always need to select the app first.",

      "Stick to well-known apps from established companies. If an app name looks unfamiliar or feels rushed, skip it. When in doubt, research the app before connecting it to your ChatGPT account.",
      "Apps can change how they work after updates. Take a moment to review permissions if an app adds new features or requests additional access. This habit helps you spot changes early.",
      "Even trusted tools do not need your Social Security number, bank details or passwords. Keep chats focused on tasks and ideas. Treat ChatGPT like a public workspace, not a private vault.",
      "Your ChatGPT password should not match any other account. A password manager can help generate and store strong credentials. This step alone blocks many common attacks. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.",

It also makes technology feel more helpful and less overwhelming. The best ChatGPT apps solve real problems, from discovering music to planning trips and choosing where to eat.

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Apple has released emergency security updates to fix two zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploited in highly targeted attacks.",
      "The company described the activity as an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" aimed at specific individuals. Although Apple did not identify the attackers or victims, the limited scope strongly suggests spyware-style operations rather than widespread cybercrime.",
      "Both flaws affect WebKit, the browser engine behind Safari and all browsers on iOS. As a result, the risk is significant. In some cases, simply visiting a malicious webpage may be enough to trigger an attack.",
      "Below, we break down what these vulnerabilities mean and explain how you can better protect yourself.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Apple released emergency updates after confirming two zero-day WebKit flaws were actively exploited in targeted attacks. (Reuters/Thomas Peter/File Photo)",
      "NEW IPHONE SCAM TRICKS OWNERS INTO GIVING PHONES AWAY",
      "What Apple says about the zero-day vulnerabilities",
      "The two vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174, and Apple confirmed that both were exploited in the same real-world attacks. According to Apple's security bulletin, the flaws were abused on versions of iOS released before iOS 26, and the attacks were limited to \"specific targeted individuals.\"",
      "CVE-2025-43529 is a WebKit use-after-free vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution when a device processes maliciously crafted web content. To put it simply, it allows attackers to run their own code on a device by tricking the browser into mishandling memory. Apple credited Google's Threat Analysis Group with discovering this flaw, which is often a strong indicator of nation-state or commercial spyware activity.",
      "The second flaw, CVE-2025-14174, is also a WebKit issue, this time involving memory corruption. While Apple describes the impact as memory corruption rather than direct code execution, these types of bugs are often chained together with other vulnerabilities to fully compromise a device. Apple says this issue was discovered jointly by Apple and Google's Threat Analysis Group.",
      "In both cases, Apple acknowledged that it was aware of reports confirming active exploitation in the wild. That language is important because Apple typically reserves it for situations where attacks have already occurred, not just theoretical risks. The company says it addressed the bugs through improved memory management and better validation checks, without sharing deeper technical details that could help attackers replicate the exploits.",
      "Devices affected and signs of coordinated disclosure",
      "Apple has released patches across its supported operating systems, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Safari, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS.",
      "According to Apple's advisory, affected devices include iPhone 11 and newer models, multiple generations of iPad Pro, iPad Air from the third generation onward, the eighth-generation iPad and newer and the iPad mini starting with the fifth generation. This covers the vast majority of iPhones and iPads still in active use today.",
      "Apple has patched the flaws across its entire ecosystem. Fixes are available in iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2, iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3, macOS Tahoe 26.2, tvOS 26.2, watchOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2 and Safari 26.2. Because Apple requires all iOS browsers to use WebKit under the hood, the same underlying issue also affected Chrome on iOS.",
      "6 steps you can take to protect yourself from such vulnerabilities",
      "Here are six practical steps you can take to stay safe, especially in light of highly targeted zero-day attacks like this.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Because WebKit powers Safari and all iOS browsers, even a malicious webpage may be enough to put unpatched devices at risk. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "This sounds obvious, but it matters more than anything else. Zero-day attacks rely on people running outdated software. If Apple ships an emergency update, install it the same day if you can. Delaying updates is often the only window attackers need. If you tend to forget about updates, let your devices handle them for you. Enable automatic updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and Safari. That way, you are protected even if you miss the news or are traveling.",
      "Most WebKit exploits start with malicious web content. Avoid tapping on random links sent over SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram or email unless you are expecting them. If something feels off, open the site later by typing the address yourself.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you are a journalist, an activist or someone who deals with sensitive information, consider reducing your attack surface. Use Safari only, avoid unnecessary browser extensions, and limit how often you open links inside messaging apps.",
      "Apple's Lockdown Mode is designed specifically for targeted attacks. It restricts certain web technologies, blocks most message attachments, and limits attack vectors commonly used by spyware. It is not for everyone, but it exists for situations like this.",
      "Targeted attacks often start with profiling. The more personal data about you that is floating around online, the easier it is to pick you as a target. Removing data from broker sites and tightening social media privacy settings can lower your visibility.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Apple urges users to install the latest updates, especially those who may face higher-risk, targeted threats. (Cheng Xin/Getty Images)",
      "Unexpected crashes, overheating, sudden battery drain or Safari closing on its own can sometimes be warning signs. These do not automatically mean your device is compromised. However, if something feels consistently wrong, updating immediately and resetting the device is a smart move.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Apple has not shared details about who was targeted or how the attacks were delivered. However, the pattern fits closely with past spyware campaigns that focused on journalists, activists, political figures and others of interest to surveillance operators. With these patches, Apple has now fixed seven zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited in the wild in 2025 alone. That includes flaws disclosed earlier this year and a backported fix in September for older devices.",

      "DoorDash wants to help you decide where to eat, not just how your food arrives. The company has launched Zesty, a new artificial intelligence-powered social app built to make finding local restaurants faster and easier.",
      "Zesty is now in public testing in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York. Instead of scrolling through endless reviews, menus and social videos, the app lets you ask an AI chatbot for recommendations in plain language.",
      "Think of it as a digital concierge for food discovery.",

      "How Zesty works",
      "Once you open Zesty and sign in with your DoorDash account, the experience feels familiar and simple. You see nearby restaurants and a chat box where you can type exactly what you want. DoorDash says users can ask prompts like:",
      "The app blends AI search with social discovery, showing photos, comments and saved spots shared by other diners. \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that's good for introverts",
      "Brunch spots good for groups",
      "Romantic dinner with a vintage feel",
      "The AI then curates recommendations by pulling information from DoorDash data, Google Maps, TikTok, Reddit and other sources. According to DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang, the goal is to surface the best suggestions from across the web in one place. Each recommendation includes context such as ratings, social buzz and where the suggestion came from. DoorDash says the results do not imply sponsorships or paid placements.",
      "A social network built around food",
      "Zesty also adds a social layer. Users can post photos, leave comments, follow other diners and share saved spots with friends. If you find a restaurant that looks promising, you can bookmark it for later or send it to someone planning dinner with you. This makes Zesty feel less like a search engine and more like a food-focused social network. It is designed for people who enjoy discovering places through other people's experiences, not just star ratings. For DoorDash, this is a clear shift toward community-driven discovery.",
      "Why DoorDash built Zesty",
      "DoorDash wants to remove friction from the decision process. Instead of bouncing among Google, TikTok, Yelp and delivery apps, Zesty aims to bring everything together in a single guided experience. That approach also aligns with a broader trend. More people already use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to plan meals and trips. Zesty aims to offer that same convenience with a strong local and social focus.",
      "Zesty lets users ask for restaurant recommendations in natural language instead of scrolling through endless reviews and menus. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "\"At DoorDash, we're always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,\" a company spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We're piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. Zesty is now in public beta in San Francisco and New York, and we're excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.\"",
      "Of course, Zesty faces an uphill climb. Many users already rely on Google Maps or existing social apps to find restaurants. Some may not want to download another standalone app, even if it promises better recommendations. Still, Zesty could appeal to users who enjoy food discovery as a social activity. For them, a dedicated network built around local dining may feel more useful than generic search results. DoorDash appears willing to test that idea and see how users respond.\u00a0For now, the company is focused on getting people to use the app, learning what works, and fine-tuning its matching engine. Once that experience feels right, Zesty will expand to more cities.",
      "WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?",
      "Part of DoorDash's bigger expansion plan",
      "Zesty is not an isolated experiment. It fits into DoorDash's broader push beyond food delivery. Earlier this year, DoorDash rolled out features for in-person dining reservations and in-store rewards. The company also continues to invest heavily in automation and AI-driven logistics.",
      "We reported a few months ago on another major innovation from DoorDash: Dot, its fast new autonomous delivery robot. Dot is designed for short local trips and runs on an AI-powered delivery platform that decides whether an order should be handled by a Dasher, a robot or another method. Together, Zesty and Dot show how DoorDash is trying to own more of the local commerce experience, from discovery to delivery.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you enjoy trying new restaurants, Zesty could save you time and decision fatigue. Instead of reading dozens of reviews, you can ask for exactly what you want and get curated suggestions instantly. For casual diners, the app may feel unnecessary if Google already works fine. For food lovers who like sharing finds and following others with similar tastes, Zesty could become a useful daily tool. It also signals where local discovery may be heading. AI-driven recommendations paired with social proof could soon replace traditional review hunting.",

      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Zesty is now in beta in San Francisco and New York as DoorDash tests and refines its personalized matching experience. (iStock)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Zesty shows DoorDash experimenting with how people choose where to eat, not just how food gets delivered. By combining AI search with social sharing, the company is testing a more conversational and community-driven approach to local discovery. Whether Zesty becomes essential or stays niche will depend on how well it delivers meaningful recommendations. Still, it highlights DoorDash's growing ambition to shape more parts of our everyday local life.",

Infoblox found that more than 90 percent of visits to parked domains now lead to malicious content. This includes scareware, fake antivirus offers, phishing pages and malware downloads.",
      "A single mistyped web address can redirect you from a trusted site to a dangerous parked domain in seconds, Kurt Knutsson writes. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Why direct navigation has become so risky",
      "Direct navigation means typing a website address by hand instead of using a bookmark or search result. One missing letter can change everything. For example, mistyping gmail.com as gmai.com does not trigger an error. Instead, it can deliver your email straight to criminals. Infoblox found that some of these typo domains actively run mail servers to capture messages. Even worse, many of these domains form part of massive portfolios. One group tracked by Infoblox controlled nearly 3,000 lookalike domains associated with banks, tech companies and government services.",
      "Malicious parked domains often trigger fake security warnings or hidden redirects without requiring any clicks. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "How these domains decide whom to attack",
      "Not everyone sees the same thing when visiting a parked domain. That is intentional. Researchers discovered that parked pages often profile visitors in real time. They analyze IP address, device type, location, cookies and browsing behavior. Based on that data, the domain decides what you see next. Visitors using a VPN or non-residential connection often see harmless placeholder pages. Residential users on phones or home computers get redirected to scams or malware instead. This filtering helps attackers stay hidden while maximizing successful attacks.",
      "Why parked domain scams are increasing",
      "Several trends are fueling the problem. First, traffic from parked domains is often resold multiple times through affiliate networks. By the time it reaches a malicious advertiser, there is no direct relationship with the original parking company. Second, recent ad policy changes may have increased exposure. Google now requires advertisers to opt in before running ads on parked domains. While intended to improve safety, this shift may have pushed bad actors deeper into affiliate networks with weaker oversight. The result is a murky ecosystem where responsibility is difficult to trace.",
      "Even government domains are being targeted",
      "Infoblox also found typosquatting aimed at government services. In one case, a researcher accidentally visited ic3.org instead of ic3.gov while trying to report a crime. The result was a fake warning page claiming a cloud subscription had expired. That page could just as easily have delivered malware. This highlights how easy it is to fall into these traps, even when doing something important.",
      "A screenshot shows how mistyping the FBI\u2019s IC3 web address redirects users to an unrelated parked domain. (Infoblox)",
      "Ways to stay safe from parked domain traps",
      "You can reduce your risk with a few smart habits:",
      "Save banks, email providers and government portals. Avoid typing these addresses manually.",
      "Slow down when entering web addresses. One extra second can prevent a costly mistake.",
      "Strong antivirus software protects your device if a malicious page loads, blocking malware downloads, scripts and fake security pop-ups.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data brokers often fuel targeting by selling personal details. Removing your data can reduce exposure to personalized scam redirects.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Fake warnings about expired subscriptions or infected devices are a major red flag. Legitimate companies do not use panic screens.",
      "Security updates often close the exact loopholes attackers use to exploit malicious redirects.",
      "While not a cure-all, VPNs can reduce exposure to targeted redirects tied to residential IP addresses.",

      "The web has changed in subtle but dangerous ways. Parked domains are no longer passive placeholders. In many cases, they act as active delivery systems for scams and malware. The most alarming part is how little effort it takes to trigger an attack. A typo is enough. As threats grow quieter and more automated, safe browsing habits matter more than ever.",

    "story": [
      "Jenny Failla and Madison Alworth join the panel on \"Fox News Saturday Night\" to share their thoughts on OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitting he relies on ChatGPT to help with parenting.",
      "OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has moved at an unusually fast pace in 2025. According to the company, it launched GPT-5 in August, followed by GPT-5.1 in November. Now, just weeks later, GPT-5.2 has launched with familiar claims of being the smartest and most capable ChatGPT yet.",
      "At first glance, the rapid rollout might seem surprising. But there's context behind it. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly called a \"code red\" inside the company, urging teams to move faster on improving ChatGPT. That push comes as competition heats up. Google recently released Gemini 3, which reportedly outperformed ChatGPT on several artificial intelligence benchmarks and delivered stronger image generation. At the same time, Anthropic's Claude continues to advance quickly.",
      "Against that backdrop, GPT-5.2 feels less like a routine upgrade and more like a strategic response. So what actually changed in GPT-5.2, and why does OpenAI say it matters?",

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks on as he takes a lunch break, during the Federal Reserve's Integrated Review of the Capital Framework for Large Banks Conference in Washington, D.C., July 22, 2025. (REUTERS/Ken Cedeno)",
      "What exactly is GPT-5.2",
      "GPT-5.2 is the newest version in OpenAI's flagship 5-series of large language models. Like its predecessor, it includes two default variants. GPT-5.2 Instant is designed for everyday chatting and web searches. GPT-5.2 Thinking is meant for more complex tasks like long reasoning chains and multi-step problem solving. These two models are now the default for all ChatGPT users, including free users. They replace GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking entirely. If you are using ChatGPT today, you are already using GPT-5.2, whether you realize it or not.",
      "What OpenAI says GPT-5 brings to ChatGPT",
      "At the same time, OpenAI continues to position GPT-5 as \"expert intelligence for everyone.\" The company says GPT-5 delivers stronger performance across math, science, finance, law and other complex subjects. In OpenAI's view, ChatGPT now acts more like a team of on-demand experts than a basic chatbot. To support that claim, OpenAI points to practical examples. These include better coding help, more expressive writing support, clearer health-related explanations and improved safety and accuracy. The company showcases use cases such as generating app code, writing speeches, explaining medications and correcting mistakes in user-submitted images. In theory, GPT-5.2 builds on that same foundation. However, while OpenAI emphasizes deeper thinking and more reliable answers, those gains remain subtle for many everyday users.",
      "What new features does GPT-5.2 add?",
      "Here's the short answer. None. GPT-5.2 does not introduce new tools, interfaces, or headline features. Instead, OpenAI describes a series of behind-the-scenes improvements that supposedly make ChatGPT faster, smarter and more capable. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 performs better at:",

      "NEW US MILITARY GENAI TOOL \u2018CRITICAL FIRST STEP\u2019 IN FUTURE OF WARFARE, SAYS EXPERT",
      "Why testing chatbot improvements is tricky",
      "Evaluating chatbot upgrades is harder than it sounds. Responses can vary widely even when prompts stay the same. A model might excel at one task and struggle with a nearly identical one just moments later. On top of that, OpenAI's 5-series models already perform at or near the top of the field. When performance starts that high, meaningful gains become harder to detect. With that in mind, we tested GPT-5.2, and in most tests, it behaved almost identically to GPT-5.1.",
      "Why benchmarks don't tell the full story",
      "OpenAI's benchmarks show modest gains for GPT-5.2. That matters for researchers and developers working at scale. Still, even advanced users may struggle to see practical benefits. Other companies have delivered clearer upgrades. Google's Gemini Nano Banana Pro model shows obvious gains in AI image generation and editing. Those improvements are easy for anyone to test and verify. By contrast, GPT-5.2's changes feel abstract. They exist mostly on paper rather than in daily use.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you pay for ChatGPT, there's little downside to using GPT-5.2. It replaces GPT-5.1 in the model lineup and generally performs at least as well in everyday use. Free users don't have much choice either, as model access is handled automatically. For most people, the experience feels familiar and stable.",
      "The picture shifts slightly for programmers and those who use it for business. Early pricing details suggest GPT-5.2 may cost roughly 40 percent more per million tokens than GPT-5.1, depending on usage tier and access method. That makes testing important before committing at scale.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "GPT-5.2 feels like a model released under pressure rather than inspiration. It performs well, stays reliable, and moves forward in measurable ways. Still, it doesn't deliver the kind of clear progress many people expect from a new version number. OpenAI remains a leader in AI, but competition is closing in fast. As rivals roll out more noticeable improvements, small updates may no longer be enough to stand out. For now, GPT-5.2 feels less like a breakthrough and more like OpenAI holding its ground.",

    "summary": "Harvard professor leaves after 40 years, alleges woke policies destroyed academic standards and excellence in scathing &quot;Why I&apos;m Leaving Harvard&quot; critique.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer discusses how President Donald Trump plans to cut $100 million in contracts for Harvard on \u2018The Will Cain Show.\u2019",
      "A history professor who taught at Harvard University for 40 years has left the Ivy League for greener pastures, penning a biting critique on the state of the school on his way out the door.",
      "In a piece titled \"Why I'm Leaving Harvard,\" published in Compact Magazine, history professor James Hankins said he decided in 2021 to leave the school amid a flurry of wokeness and COVID restrictions, but honored a four-year retirement contract that expired just weeks ago.",
      "\"We had just endured almost two years under the university\u2019s strict Covid regime,\" Hankins wrote. \"This was a form of emergency governance that mirrored to a fault the whole country\u2019s uncritical acceptance of The Science and its proclivity, when backed by public power, for tyrannous invasions of private life.\"",
      "He added that the school forced professors to lecture wearing masks and give seminars via Zoom, which did not comport with his views on education.",
      "History professor James Hankins taught at Harvard for 40 years. (Sophie Park/Bloomberg)",
      "FIVE HOPEFUL SIGNS COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE SEEKING TRUTH ONCE MORE",
      "Then, Hankins referenced the 2020 \"Summer of Floyd,\" when violent riots broke out nationwide after George Floyd died at the hands of police in Minneapolis. He said the university's response, which he thought would amount to \"empty virtue-signaling,\" turned out to be much more sinister, suggesting that discrimination against White men in graduate admissions became policy.",
      "\"In reviewing graduate student applicants in the fall of 2020 I came across an outstanding prospect who was a perfect fit for our program,\" wrote Hankins. \"In past years this candidate would have risen immediately to the top of the applicant pool. In 2021, however, I was told informally by a member of the admissions committee that 'that' (meaning admitting a white male) was 'not happening this year.'\"",
      "He described another instance of an even higher caliber student \u2014 one who had gone to Harvard as an undergraduate and had the highest overall academic record of anyone in his class and whom Hankins described as \"certifiably brilliant\" \u2014 being rejected by every Harvard graduate program to which he applied.",
      "MOST RADICAL COURSES, CURRICULUM THAT RECEIVED FEDERAL FUNDING IN 2025",
      "\"He too was a white male,\" Hankins wrote. \"I called around to friends at several universities to find out why on earth he had been rejected. Everywhere it was the same story: Graduate admissions committees around the country had been following the same unspoken protocol as ours.",
      "\"The one exception I found to the general exclusion of white males had begun life as a female,\" he continued.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson affirmed, as Hankins wrote in his piece, that graduate admissions are faculty-led and localized at the department level.",
      "But Hankins, who has now taken a role as a visiting professor at the University of Florida, didn't just critique the school over these particular examples. He also described how, during his 40-year tenure at the school, the history department, harangued by activists, has lowered academic standards and all but abandoned the Western canon and Western history alike.",
      "The Trump administration announced it was freezing over $2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard University said it would not comply with federal demands regarding antisemitism. (Reuters/Nicholas Pfosi)",
      "DEMOCRAT PROFESSOR BREAKS RANKS TO CHALLENGE WOKENESS DOMINATING AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES",
      "He explained that senior academic appointments at Harvard before the 1990s followed a \"two-book standard. Appointees were expected to have published two books, one typically a graduate or doctoral dissertation republished as a book, and another showcasing the academic's expertise on a given subject, before their appointments.",
      "\"The two-book standard would be shelved in the late 1990s when we were under increasing pressure to hire more women faculty,\" he wrote. \"Feminist activists, at Harvard as elsewhere, were demanding that half of all new appointments be women. That, they claimed, was what liberal standards of equality required.\"",
      "The feminist push had a devastating effect in the history department, according to Hankins.",
      "\"Since at the time women formed less than 10 percent of PhDs in history and were even rarer in the mid-career cohorts from which Harvard tended to hire, equality required that standards be lowered. Feminists denied vociferously that this was happening,\" he wrote.",
      "\"The real problem, they said, was the inability of men properly to value female scholarship,\" wrote Hankins, later adding that he and others who opposed the new order were labeled \"sexists.\"",
      "Anti-Israel activists gather at Harvard University to show their support for Palestinians in Gaza at a rally in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Oct. 14, 2023. (Joseph Prezioso / AFP)",
      "When the school began focusing on \"global civilizations\" and \"transnational history\" rather than Western civilization in the classroom, the disaffected professor fought back. He guided a two-semester course requirement that would first teach students about Western civilization, and then integrate non-Western civilization into their body of historical knowledge.",
      "HEAD OF AMERICA'S 'FREE ENTERPRISE' COLLEGE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ACADEMIA DESPITE LEFT-WING BIAS: 'THERE IS HOPE'",
      "That program was short-lived, lasting only through the early 2000s, when Hankins described continued and more rapid decline in academic standards.",
      "\"Soon the department was promoting an ever higher percentage of junior faculty,\" he wrote. \"The dynamic was similar to Congress voting to restrain its own spending. At one point we took a vow to curb promotions at 20 percent, then 50 percent. After that, there emerged an expectation that junior faculty would be promoted in the course of nature so long as they could get a book-length manuscript, or maybe a few really strong chapters, ready for publication in time for a tenure review.\"",
      "He described these newer and less qualified promotees as \"left-leaning,\" and said that \"countervailing winds\" at the university ushered in an institutional globalization, including more foreign students and the continued dwindling of Western history courses.",
      "BUCKLEY INSTITUTE REPORT FINDS 27 YALE DEPARTMENTS HAVE NO REPUBLICAN FACULTY",
      "James Hankins said Harvard has lowered its academic standards.",
      "\"'Transnational history' meant that Europeanists would no longer teach the internal history of European nations\u2014no more courses on the German Reformation, Elizabethan England, or the French Revolution,\" he said. \"Rather they would teach about interactions between Europe and the non-European world.\"",
      "Hankins later remarked that while professors of other history courses, like Chinese history, taught the jingoistic Chinese patriotism and the country's long and successful struggle against a colonial and suffocating West.",
      "However, such pride was not to be broached in Western history classes.",
      "\"Western global history, by contrast, displays no loyalty to Western societies or traditions; quite the contrary,\" he wrote. \"In the hands of hyper-progressive (or 'woke') practitioners, Western global history is often, indeed, actively anti-Western. Older Western societies are presented as inherently illiberal, to be contrasted unfavorably with the perfectly liberal society promised by the prophets of the progressive future.\"",

      "Hankins concluded that he has little hope for reform in what he calls \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions.",
      "\"For those like myself, however, who have lived through the decline of higher education in 'elite' universities, that would be a triumph of hope over experience, as Johnson said of remarriage. For now, a better hope lies in building new institutions unencumbered by the corruption and self-hatred that infect the old.\"",

      "The new tax on contraceptives has drawn ridicule and concern inside China. On social media, some users joked about stockpiling condoms before prices rise, while others argued that the cost of contraception is insignificant compared with the expense of raising a child, the BBC reported.",
      "\"I have one child, and I don\u2019t want any more,\" Daniel Luo, a 36-year-old resident of Henan province, told the BBC. He said the price increase would not change his family plans, comparing it to small hikes in subway fares that do not alter daily behavior.",

      "Henrietta Levin of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) described the move as symbolic, reflecting Beijing\u2019s attempt to lift what she called strikingly low fertility numbers. She also cautioned that many incentives and subsidies depend on provincial governments that are already heavily indebted, raising questions about whether they can fund the measures adequately.",

Research released by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2022 found condoms are used by about 9% of couples, while 44.2% rely on intrauterine devices and 30.5% on female sterilization. Male sterilization accounts for 4.7%.",
      "Some women say the tax revives resentment toward the government\u2019s long history of involvement in reproductive decisions. The Communist Party enforced the one-child policy from roughly 1980 until 2015 through fines, penalties and, in some cases, forced abortions, according to the AP. Children born outside the policy were sometimes denied household registration, effectively rendering them non-citizens.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing intensifying political scrutiny after U.K. counterterrorism police began assessing resurfaced social media posts by Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah, whom the prime minister had publicly welcomed back to Britain following his release from prison in Egypt.",
      "Abd El-Fattah was forced to apologize this week after the controversial posts published between 2008 and 2014 that included remarks endorsing violence against \"U.S. soldiers, Zionists and police.\" The posts resurfaced shortly after his return to the U.K., triggering political backlash and a counterterrorism review, including a tweet he wrote: \"From time to time I remind people that I rejoice when U.S. soldiers are killed, and support killing Zionists, even civilians.\"",
      "Abd El-Fattah returned to Britain on Boxing Day after receiving a pardon from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

      "An official Counter Terrorism Policing spokesperson said authorities have received multiple public referrals related to Abd El-Fattah\u2019s historical posts and that they are now being assessed by specialist officers within the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU), according to GB News.",
      "GB News reported that the posts under review include material in which Abd El-Fattah allegedly described the killing of Zionists as \"heroic\" and appeared to call for violence against police. One post is reported to have stated, \"We need to kill more of them.\" Another post is alleged to have read: \"By the way I\u2019m a racist, I don\u2019t like white people so piss off.",
      "Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper ordered an urgent review into what she described as \"serious information failures\" in the case and said neither she nor Starmer were briefed on the social media posts before Abd El-Fattah arrived in Britain.

      "He continued, \"The fact that el-Fattah\u2019s public commentary was not checked by successive administrations allowing him access to first citizenship and consular support and then admission to the U.K. shows how shambolic our institutions have become. There is nothing British about this man beyond a quirk of administration, and he should be stripped of his status immediately and deported on account of who he really is: an enemy of this state.\"",

      "In his apology, Abd El-Fattah said the posts reflected \"expressions of a young man\u2019s anger and frustration in a time of regional crises,\" including wars in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza, and rising police brutality in Egypt. He said he particularly regretted posts written during online disputes and acknowledged he \"should have known better.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department is scrambling to review about 5.2 million pages related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to comply with a law passed by Congress, a source familiar with the operation told NBC News on Tuesday night.",
      "That number is much higher than previously known.",
      "The Justice Department was seeking to enlist roughly 400 employees in the effort to sift through the records, which is expected to run from Monday to Jan. 20, two sources familiar with the plan told NBC News.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that lawyers from department's headquarters, the FBI, the Southern District of Florida and the Southern District of New York \"are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law.\"",
      "\"It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we\u2019re asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,\" he wrote on X. \"Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released. The Attorney General\u2019s and this Administration\u2019s goal is simple: transparency and protecting victims.\"",
      "A bipartisan law required the Justice Department to release the federal government's trove of Epstein files by Dec. 19. The New York Times reported the extra documents Tuesday evening.",
      "The Justice Department said Dec. 24 on X that lawyers were \u201cworking around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims\u201d but that because of the massive volume of material, the process \u201cmay take a few more weeks.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has come under fire since it failed to release all of the government's records related to Epstein by the Dec. 19 deadline, which was required by the law signed by President Donald Trump. Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who spearheaded the legislation in Congress, said this month that they are speaking with members of Congress about holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also said last week that he would introduce a resolution directing the Senate to \u201cinitiate legal action against the DOJ\u201d for releasing only some of its records related to Epstein.",
      "A day later, the Justice Department released 30,000 more documents \u2014 the third batch that was made public \u2014 including an email that claimed that flight logs show Trump flew on Epstein\u2019s plane at least eight times in the 1990s. The email was from an unnamed assistant U.S. attorney from the Southern District of New York, but the sender and the recipient were redacted.",
      "The Justice Department said on X that some of the documents included \"untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"",
      "After that release, Khanna wrote on X: \".@RepThomasMassie & I will continue to keep the pressure on. After we said we are bringing contempt, the DOJ is now finding millions more documents to release. They need to release the 302 FBI statements & the emails on Epstein\u2019s computer. The Epstein class must go.\"",
      "Last Friday, Trump acknowledged that the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI had turned over more than a million documents potentially related to the Epstein case to the Justice Department. He complained that the Justice Department \"is being forced to spend all of its time on this Democrat inspired Hoax.\" He added, \"The Radical Left doesn\u2019t want people talking about TRUMP & REPUBLICAN SUCCESS, only a long ago dead Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 Just another Witch Hunt!!!\"",
      "Trump has not been accused of and has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. The White House has said Trump ended his relationship with Epstein in the early 2000s because Epstein was a \u201ccreep.\u201d",
      "Epstein died in jail in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, was found guilty in New York in 2021 of multiple sex trafficking charges for her role in the sexual abuse of underage girls and is serving a 20-year prison sentence."

Another video provided by someone's dash camera appeared to show Olmos walking by herself on the side of a road, which authorities said gave them a direction of where she may have gone.",
      "Ultimately, authorities found Olmos' body roughly 100 yards from her home on a follow-up search of the area. She had previously been obscured by brush, and Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar credited the help of a \u201csmall army\u201d of FBI agents to scour the area a second time.",
      "The medical examiner determined the cause of death to be a gunshot wound to the head, with the manner of death ruled a suicide.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Wednesday continued his attacks on the Somali immigrants living in Minnesota, accusing them of being \"scammers\" and \"lowlifes\" in a post on Truth Social, and calling for them to be sent back to Somalia.",
      "Trump also accused Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., one of the first Muslim women and the first Somali American to serve in Congress, of being \"one of the many scammers.\" Omar has not been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "\"Much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia. 'Congresswoman' Omar, an ungrateful loser who only complains and never contributes, is one of the many scammers,\" the president claimed, without evidence, on social media. \"Lowlifes like this can only be a liability to our Country\u2019s greatness. Send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth.\"",
      "His post referenced ongoing investigations of widespread fraud among social services programs in Minnesota that involve some members of the state\u2019s Somali community, but the Justice Department says was led by Aimee Bock, who is white.",
      "In 2022, during the Biden administration, the Justice Department indicted individuals in an alleged $250 million scheme to defraud a child nutrition program.",
      "But in recent weeks, that fraud scandal and additional, unsubstantiated allegations of fraud in several Minnesota child care centers from a right-wing online influencer named Nick Shirley have engulfed conservative media and reached Trump administration officials.",
      "On Monday, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed that he'd seen Shirley's videos and that the FBI had already surged resources to Minnesota to assist ongoing investigative efforts to uncover fraud.",
      "On Tuesday, the Health and Human Services Department said it was freezing all federal child care payments to the state of Minnesota in the wake of Shirley's allegations.",
      "Trump, who publicly criticized Omar during his first administration, has for weeks attacked Omar and Somalis following news reports about convictions related to the Minnesota fraud.",
      "Earlier this month, in the Oval Office, the president went on a tirade against Omar and the Somali community in her state, telling reporters, \"She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be a congresswoman, and I\u2019m sure people are looking at that, and she should be thrown the hell out of our country. And most of those people \u2014 they have destroyed Minnesota, OK?\"",
      "And during a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month aimed at messaging on affordability, Trump revived a slur he used during his first term \u2014 \"shithole countries\" \u2014 while referencing Afghanistan, Haiti and Somalia.",
      "In November, in another post on Truth Social, the president announced he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota, writing, \"I am, as President of the United States, hereby terminating, effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota. Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It\u2019s OVER!\"",
      "The president cannot unilaterally terminate a TPS program, but can direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to do so. Past attempts by the president to terminate TPS programs have faced legal challenges.",
      "Meanwhile, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., who was the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year, and Omar have defended their state.",
      "After news broke on Tuesday that the federal government was halting child care payments to Minnesota, Walz wrote in a post on X, \"This is Trump\u2019s long game. We\u2019ve spent years cracking down on fraudsters. It\u2019s a serious issue \u2014 but this has been his plan all along. He\u2019s politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans.\"",
      "On Wednesday, during an appearance on Fox News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said cracking down on fraud is a \u201ctop priority\u201d for the Trump administration.",
      "She added that the administration could pursue denaturalization in some cases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also not afraid to use denaturalization. That\u2019s a tool at the president and the secretary of state\u2019s disposal, and it\u2019s one this administration has previously used before,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "Under federal law, a naturalized U.S. citizen can only be denaturalized in a few circumstances outlined in the law, including if they committed fraud during the citizenship process. If Trump administration officials believe someone committed fraud, they cannot denaturalize an individual right away. The process is subject to court proceedings.",
      "In another post on Tuesday, the governor promised to continue investigating and prosecuting fraud in his state, writing on X, \"My message remains clear: If you threaten everything that makes our state a great place to live by committing fraud in Minnesota, you will be caught and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Omar responded to the Trump administration's suspension of TPS for Somalis in Minnesota, writing in a post on X, \"Somali TPS holders are our neighbors, coworkers, and small business owners. They\u2019ve built their lives here. I led members of Congress in demanding answers on the administration\u2019s legally dubious and dangerous threats.\"",
      "And after the president's comments about Somalia and Omar in Pennsylvania earlier this month, the congresswoman wrote in a separate post on X, \"Trump\u2019s obsession with me is beyond weird. He needs serious help. Since he has no economic policies to tout, he\u2019s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead. He continues to be a national embarrassment.\"",

      "Brown University's shelter-in-place order would not be lifted until the next morning. By then, authorities had shifted from securing the scene to focusing on identifying and locating the suspect, authorities later indicated.",
      "A person of interest was detained the next morning but was released later that day after Rhode Island officials said evidence pointed elsewhere.",
      "Five days after the shooting, a judge signed an arrest warrant for Neves Valente in connection with the attack.",
      "Neves Valente was a native of Portugal who graduated at the top of his class and moved to the U.S. to attend Brown from August 2000 to spring 2001 on a student visa in the physics Ph.D. program.

      "Marty Reisman Was a Superstar Table Tennis Player",
      "Reisman was born in February 1930 in New York City, according to his 1974 memoir, \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America's Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",
      "In 1997, when he was 67, he became the oldest person to win a national championship in a racket sport, per his obituary.",
      "He Started Playing the Game As a Child to Deal with Anxiety",
      "Reisman told several interviewers he began playing ping-pong as a child to deal with his debilitating anxiety.",
      "\u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 9 years old and ended up in Bellevue Hospital. Ping-Pong was the ultimate escape. My racket became a sensuous connection between the ball and my brain,\" he told Forbes for an interview published in 2005.",
      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",
      "He Was Famous for Performing Flashy Tricks",
      "After Reisman learned audiences would pay to see him do tricks while playing ping-pong, he began appearing in special exhibitions.",
      "He and U.S. teammate Doug Cartland accepted an offer to be the opening act for three years for the basketball trickster the Harlem Globetrotters, delighting audiences by playing \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using frying pans, according to his biography.",
      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his 1974 memoir \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America\u2019s Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cI took on people in the gladiatorial spirit,\u201d he told the Times in March 2012, just months before his death.",
      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",
      "Like Chalamet's character in Marty Supreme,\" Reisman was also a the bad boy of his sport.",
      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",
      "Reisman Died in 2012",
      "Reisman died in December 2012 of complications of heart and lung ailments age 82, according to The New York Times.",
      "His death was announced by Table Tennis Nation, an organization Reisman founded in 2010.",
      "He was survived by his wife Yoshiko, a daughter, Debbie Reisman, and several grandchildren, per his obituary."

Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",

Set in post-WWII Germany, this novel visits an orphanage filled with the abandoned mixed-race children of German women and Black American GI\u2019s. This is an unknown history about love, resilience and identity.\"",

      "Whether she\u2019s performing \u201cDefying Gravity,\u201d \u201cNo Good Deed\u201d or any other major musical number, Cynthia Erivo manages to hit every note thanks to her rigid routine.",
      "The Grammy and Tony-winning actor, 38, has impressed fans all over the world with her voice, thanks in part to her role as Elphaba in \u201cWicked\u201d and sequel \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d over the last two years. Next up, she\u2019ll take on the challenge of starring in the West End production of \u201cDracula,\u201d where she will portray 23 different roles.",
      "Ahead of preparing for the show to premiere next year, Erivo spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about her busy schedule over the past few years and how she has preserved her voice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always taking care of it,\u201d Erivo told the publication. She also shared that she is constantly in contact with vocal coaches Joan Lader and Antea Birchett and performs warmup exercises before all her performances.",
      "She added, \u201cI don\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t smoke. I\u2019m a crazy person. I don\u2019t eat anything on planes.\u201d",
      "Erivo then revealed one tip that keeps her vocal cords healthy: drinking tea.",
      "\u201cI bring everything with me: my tea, my water. Someone made a meme of the mug that I carry around because I have it with me everywhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have it in several different colors. I will not be without it because I want my tea to always be warm enough to hydrate me.\u201d",
      "She said the strict rules have become instinctive.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just how I exist. I will do whatever I need to make sure she\u2019s OK \u2014 except apparently take a break,\u201d she said.",
      "A break will have to wait. Erivo spoke with the outlet one day before her first full week of \u201cDracula\u201d rehearsals began. The musical, adapted and written by Kip Williams, will run from Feb. 4 to May 30, 2026 at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre. It is described as an \u201cintoxicating, blood-pumping reimagining of the immortal gothic horror.\u201d",
      "Speaking about the demanding role, Erivo said, \u201cMy head is so full of information. It\u2019s not just the words, it\u2019s just not just the characters, it\u2019s the movement on stage with these characters, and the changes that happen on the stage with these characters. Costume changes are happening in real time in front of you; the character\u2019s becoming another character with a beat where there is no costume change; I\u2019m putting teeth in at the same time.\u201d",
      "Even though the actor has mastered many performances on the screen and stage, she said the show will be a new experience for her.",
      "\u201cThis is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before, and my brain is definitely being stretched to its limit,\u201d she shared.",
      "But, she said she knows when to say \u201cno\u201d if her constant schedule becomes too much.",
      "\u201cIf it feels like (an opportunity) might be something that I\u2019m going to have to learn from \u2014 this is really scary, this is going to force me to find something else in my character, something else in who I am \u2014 then I say yes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe problem is a lot of those things are showing up right now, so I\u2019m not saying no very often, but I do say no.\u201d",
      "In addition to her West End run, Erivo is also expected to be highlighted during the upcoming award season. She already scored a nomination for best film female actor \u2014 musical or comedy at the 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards, airing Jan. 11, for her portrayal of Elphaba in \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d"

      "This new trend on TikTok is accompanied by the song \u201cTurn The Lights Off\u201d by DJ Kato and Jon N\u00f8rgaard. The duo released the track in 2010. After learning it went viral, DJ Kato made his own video using the Hamm edit where he showed how \u201csurreal\u201d it was to have the \u201cNo. 1 viral song in the world.\u201d",

I thought it was just going to be me and Joyce, and that\u2019s already nerve-wracking,\u201d Schnapp says. \u201cSo to have everyone standing there watching was really nerve-wracking in a lot of different ways.\u201d",

Who are they going to write it to? Obviously in the back of your head you know the impact it\u2019s going to have on a lot of people in the real world struggling with similar issues of their own self identity.\u201d",

      "\u201cProbably Jonathan,\u201d he says, referring to his character's older brother. \u201cHe\u2019s been there since the beginning and always stood by his side.

      "The first four seasons of \"Emily in Paris\" have been a romantic whirlwind for its onscreen besties, Emily and Mindy, but the actors who play the characters say they're not eager for their onscreen counterparts to find their happily ever after.",
      "Many fans of the show are rooting for Lily Collins' character, Emily, to end up with Gabriel (Lucas Bravo), but the actor has a different take on the matter when asked who Emily's endgame should be.",
      "\"I don\u2019t like thinking in terms of endgame because Darren (Star, the show's creator) keeps writing these amazing storylines that you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, I didn\u2019t see that coming,\u2019\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Ashley Park, who plays Mindy, agrees with her real-life bestie and notes that she was shocked when she learned that her character would have a secret romance with Alfie (Lucien Laviscount), Emily's ex, in Season 5.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t even think that Alfie was on the slate. I think if I chose one of them, then it would maybe limit the possibility of another season,\" she says.",
      "Season 5 ends with Nicolas (Paul Forman) proposing to Mindy and Emily breaking up with Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini). Then, Gabriel invites Emily to join him in Greece. Will she accept his offer? Fans will have to wait to see if the series gets renewed for Season 6 to find out.",
      "Regardless, Collins says she's more excited to see her character blossom personally and says the romance is just a bonus.",
      "\"I really love this idea that Emily just continues the relationship with herself and keeps evolving. And to me, that\u2019s the most beautiful relationship,\" she says.",
      "And besides, Emily and Mindy's friendship may be the most special relationship of all.",
      "\"I think for Mindy, Emily is the only endgame,\" Park says.",
      "\"I know, I\u2019ve been thinking that too,\" Collins agrees.",
      "Looking back on Emily and Mindy's romantic journeys in Season 5, Collins and Park have some thoughts about the direction they took in their personal lives.",
      "Park says it was interesting to see Mindy feeling romantically conflicted for the first time this season.",
      "\"I think for the first time, her gut and her heart and her mind are all in different places, and she doesn\u2019t know how to trust any one of them, and she ends up going with the flow in certain ways that are not true to herself,\" she says.",
      "Park says that Mindy \"leads with a lot of fear\" and \"self-preservation\" this season.",
      "\"And so, I would advise her to not do that,\" she says.",
      "Meanwhile, Collins is proud of the way that Emily gave Marcello a second chance, only to realize she couldn't move to Italy to be with him.",
      "\"I would tell Emily, 'Good job' because I think she stood up for herself in a lot of ways, and she made a decision that was really hard, but she followed her heart and she respected herself. She also allowed herself grace,\" Collins says."

      "She focused in on the image, she said, and \u201cjust freaked out like, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s him. I didn\u2019t even want to think it because someone might hear my thoughts and warn him to flee.\u201d",
      "McLeod, a 42-year-old former U.S. Marine, was apprehended in El Salvador days later and is awaiting trial in San Diego on a charge of first-degree murder in the June 2016 strangulation of Krystal Mitchell. He pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in March. His attorneys either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. In court filings, they said McLeod accidentally killed Mitchell during \u201crough, consensual sex gone wrong.\u201d",

She has used the improbable platform she developed pursuing McLeod to write two books \u2014 \u201cThe Chase\u201d and \u201cThe Capture\u201d \u2014 and to help other grieving parents navigate the mix of frustration, despair and confusion left by an unsolved homicide.",

Through a nonprofit Wentzel established, Angels of Justice, she launched a campaign urging the White House to treat the country\u2019s massive backlog of unsolved murders as a national emergency.",

      "For Rachel Glass, whose daughter was found strangled along with her pregnant roommate in Arizona 15 years ago, Wentzel provided an empathetic ear and insight into an investigative process that Glass \u2014 a longtime nurse \u2014 knew nothing about.",
      "\u201cIf there are things that go on and you think, what the hell is this, I\u2019d call her and say, you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened now,\u201d Glass recalled. \u201cAnd she might tell me x, y and z about why it has to play out like that.\u201d",

According to the statement, a deputy medical examiner determined she had been strangled and later compared the severity of the injury to someone who\u2019d been struck with a baseball bat or had their neck stomped on.",
      "Mitchell, 30, had been visiting the city with McLeod from Phoenix, where the divorced mother of two worked as a property manager, Wentzel said. To her mother, Mitchell was the life of the party \u2014 and someone who turned heads whenever she walked into a room.",
      "Mitchell met McLeod through work a few weeks before \u2014 he\u2019d gone to her office to rent an apartment, her mother said \u2014 and they\u2019d traveled to San Diego. Mitchell was impressed by how much McLeod seemed to care for his young son, Wentzel said, and she didn\u2019t appear to know about his previous allegations of domestic violence.",
      "One of those alleged incidents occurred not long before their trip, court records in California show. In Riverside County, he was charged that April with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse \u2014 an alleged crime that involved accusations that he strangled his wife, according to the statement of facts.",
      "McLeod pleaded not guilty, the Riverside County records show, and in a filing his lawyers in Mitchell\u2019s case have said that he has a \u201chistory of consensual sexual practices that included elements of the BDSM community such as bondage, whipping, slapping, choking and erotic asphyxiation, sometimes to unconsciousness.\u201d",
      "That earlier case was not adjudicated, however, and McLeod disappeared after Mitchell\u2019s death. According to prosecutors, on June 10, he allegedly drove Mitchell\u2019s car to San Diego International Airport, where he rented another car and headed to Mexico.",
      "An international search",
      "The San Diego Police Department identified McLeod as a person of interest in Mitchell\u2019s death almost immediately. A warrant seeking his arrest in her murder was filed June 13.",
      "But McLeod was nowhere to be found. Eventually, Wentzel recalled, the Marshals Service got involved and offered a reward. But she became frustrated with the government\u2019s inability to quickly investigate leads in foreign countries, she said. U.S. embassies seemed less than enthusiastic about helping, she said, and she recalled a deputy marshal telling her that they couldn\u2019t just \u201crun in and get the guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s another country,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201cWe got to get approval.\u201d",
      "The Marshals Service declined to comment. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "So Wentzel began searching herself. Although she\u2019d worked for several years as a police officer and detective in her native Guam decades ago, she said that experience didn\u2019t begin to prepare her for the years of social media sleuthing that she was about to embark on.",
      "One of her first steps was to pull together a \u201cwanted\u201d poster with pictures of McLeod, along with a brief description of the slaying and the reward amount \u2014 at the time $5,000, she said. She focused on Belize, a place she\u2019d heard he might be, and circulated information among dozens of Facebook accounts \u2014 gyms and resorts, restaurants and a university, screenshots of the messages show.",
      "After posting the information to a buy/sell group, Wentzel recalled, the responses started rolling in. Some were by phone. Others came via WhatsApp or Facebook.",
      "\u201cMadam I saw this man I am sure of it from his tattoos and his face,\u201d one message read, according to a screenshot.",
      "\u201cIf he is here he will b caught,\u201d read another.",
      "But then, he wasn\u2019t. And the messages continued. There were tips that he was in Honduras, that he was in Guatemala. Some tipsters seemed to legitimately want to help, she said. Others seemed like scammers.",
      "\u201cOne guy contacted me and said, OK, he\u2019s here,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI know where he\u2019s working at. I\u2019ve got pictures. I\u2019ve got all this. So, you know, I need you to send me $1,000.\u201d",
      "There were so many tips, said Mike Wentzel, that fielding them became a 24/7 job for his wife. At times, he considered asking her to dial things back, but never could.",
      "\u201cThis is her child,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I tell her to stop?\u201d",
      "But there were times when the thought crossed her mind. Keeping hope alive during the pandemic, when that steady flow of tips dried up, was especially difficult, she said.",
      "The final tip",
      "As this slump in information dragged on, Wentzel said, local and federal officials announced that McLeod had been added to the Marshals\u2019 list of its 15 most wanted fugitives. In the spring 2021 announcement, they also announced that the reward for information leading to McLeod\u2019s arrest had grown to $50,000.",
      "His last known location was in Guatemala in 2017, the officials said.",
      "Wentzel said she believes it was a tip linked to that Central American country that ultimately led to McLeod\u2019s capture. Five years after he was spotted in Guatemala, she said, a couple of tipsters told her they\u2019d seen McLeod at a hotel just north of the country\u2019s border with El Salvador.",
      "Wentzel surveyed YouTube videos from the hotel to see if she could spot his face, she recalled, and she posted a \u201cwanted\u201d ad on Facebook that targeted accounts in the area. Wentzel said she set a 100-mile radius for the ad, meaning that everyone in that zone would see McLeod\u2019s face.",
      "Eventually, Wentzel said, she learned from the Marshals Service that someone saw one of her ads and shared a brochure with authorities that appeared to show McLeod. The brochure was from a Salvadoran English school not far from the Guatemalan hotel, she said.",
      "It was this image that prompted Wentzel to conclude: \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d",
      "Four days later, on Aug. 30, 2022, authorities announced that McLeod had been taken into custody in Sonsonate, El Salvador, where he\u2019d been teaching English. He landed in San Diego the next day.",
      "Wentzel wrestled with a tangle of emotion as McLeod\u2019s arraignment approached. She thought about her daughter\u2019s final moments and ticked through a litany of revenge fantasies, she recalled. But she didn\u2019t want to stew in hatred and bitterness. So she tried to focus on her daughter\u2019s children, whom she and her husband have raised, and on the other victims she\u2019s sought to help.",
      "\u201cMurder does this to you \u2014 it makes you somebody you\u2019re not, if you allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t picture living my life out like this. I wanted to be a grandma and I just wanted to travel and have fun and live the rest of my life out with my family. But it made me something else.\u201d"

      "A firsthand account of an explosion along the Venezuelan coast on Dec. 18 is raising questions about who may have been responsible for the attack and whether it was connected to the U.S.\u2019 escalating pressure campaign against the South American country.",
      "The arid coastal strip in the northwest of Venezuela, known as Alta Guajira, is heavily controlled by the National Liberation Army, or Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (ELN) in Spanish, an armed guerilla group known for its history of drug trafficking that is also active in neighboring Colombia.",
      "Two members of Venezuela\u2019s Wayuu indigenous community in the area told NBC News that they witnessed an unexplained explosion on Dec. 18 that destroyed a hut that possibly was used for storage.",
      "President Donald Trump said in an interview with WABC radio in New York last week that the U.S. had \u201cknocked out\u201d a facility tied to Venezuela, a move that would be a major escalation in U.S. military strikes to counter alleged drug-trafficking by the South American country.",
      "NBC News reporting has not established a link between the explosion described by Trump and the explosion described by the eyewitnesses in northwest Venezuela.",
      "The apparent attack follows months of U.S. military pressure, including dozens of strikes on boats in international waters. The White House has claimed that the boats carried drugs, though officials have not provided evidence.",
      "In the short phone interview Friday, Trump responded to a comment about Venezuela by touting the administration\u2019s attacks on alleged drug boats before referring to a strike on a \u201cbig plant or big facility\u201d that he said took place two nights earlier.",
      "Pressed about the attack Monday at a media availability session at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, Trump said it was a \u201cmajor explosion\u201d in a dock area along Venezuela\u2019s shoreline where boats were loaded with drugs.",
      "The CIA has declined to comment on reports that it conducted a drone strike last week at a port facility in Venezuela. The White House has also declined to comment beyond Trump\u2019s remarks on anything related to possible land strikes in Venezuela.",
      "Ana, one of the witnesses who did not want her last name used for fear of reprisals, told NBC News by phone that the explosion she witnessed happened on the afternoon of Dec. 18, a few days after she heard a strange noise that she guessed might be a drone surveilling the area. She said she was fishing for dinner along with relatives when the explosion destroyed the hut.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Ana said, noting that the explosion was so loud that she and her relatives were unable to hear for hours. She suspects that some of her relatives suffered hearing damage and said her family\u2019s boat was destroyed along with their fishing nets.",
      "\u201cWe are humble people who fish to survive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need help to recover what we lost.\u201d",
      "The other witness, who is also a member of the Wayuu indigenous community and did not want to provide his full name for fear of reprisals, corroborated Ana\u2019s story in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a missile or a rocket. The truth is, we don\u2019t know what it was,\u201d the second witness said. \u201cBut it was a big explosion.\u201d",
      "According to Ana, representatives from the Venezuelan government showed up the morning after she heard the blast \u2014 around 10 a.m. Dec. 19. She said local residents asked them for help, for a doctor to check on the hearing problems and for new fishing nets and hammocks, which had also been blown up.",
      "Ana said one of government representatives blamed the U.S. and said: \u201cThe gringos did this.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked the Venezuelan government for comment and did not immediately receive a response. It is not clear who was responsible for the Dec. 18 explosion.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to be alive,\u201d Ana said. \u201cBut we\u2019re scared.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump declined to answer when he was asked whether it was the military or the CIA that conducted the strike inside Venezuela that he described last week.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI know exactly who it was, but I don\u2019t want to say who it was. But you know, it was along the shore.\u201d",
      "With details so scarce, Trump\u2019s comments have touched off a wave of speculation inside Venezuela about the U.S.\u2019 target. For days, local news reports and videos on social media have circulated of a explosion last Wednesday in Maracaibo, a major port city.",
      "Primazol, a chemical production company, said one of its warehouses had caught fire. In a statement later, it \u201ccategorically rejected\u201d rumors on social media that the fire was connected to any U.S. strike.",
      "But in a lengthy post on X, Colombia President Gustavo Petro said \u201cTrump bombed a factory in Maracaibo\u201d where it was feared that the ELN was mixing coca paste to make cocaine and take advantage of the port\u2019s location by the sea.",
      "\u201cTrump has been led to believe that I am a front man for Maduro, hence his recent references to me,\u201d Petro wrote, referring to former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \u201cI thought that American intelligence was more professional, or that even if it is, the U.S. president doesn\u2019t listen to it and surrounds himself with greedy far-right individuals who are not looking for the truth.\u201d"

      "The protests erupted Sunday and gathered pace Monday after the Islamic Republic\u2019s currency, the rial, hit a record low against the dollar. Many in Iran are already struggling with the cost of living, and rising prices have fueled concerns about potential hyperinflation.",

      "The Iranian rial crashed to 1.42 million to the dollar on Sunday and was being traded for 1.38 million to the dollar on Monday. The dramatic drop in the value of the currency has led to families struggling to make ends meet as the value of their savings has plunged, analysts say.",
      "According to the state statistics center, the inflation rate in December rose to 42.2% from the same period last year and is 1.8% higher than in November. Food prices rose 72% and health and medical items were up 50% from December last year, according to the statistics center. Many critics see the rate as a sign of approaching hyperinflation.",

      "The protests began among shopkeepers and traders in Tehran, with state media reporting that many stores around the Grand Bazaar were closed Monday as hundreds gathered.",
      "The currency drop and fluctuating prices saw traders selling imported goods particularly affected.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian acknowledged the country\u2019s deep economic woes in a message posted to X on Monday. He said he had instructed the minister of interior to meet with representatives from the protesters in order to hear their concerns and try to solve their problems.",

      "Standing alongside him at the top of the meeting, Netanyahu praised Trump.",
      "\"I'll say it again and again and again, we\u2019ve never had a friend like President Trump in the White House. It\u2019s not even close,\" he said. \"And I think you can judge that by not merely by the frequency of our meetings, but by the content and the intensity.\"",

      "\"He can be very difficult on occasion, but you need a strong man,\" Trump added. \"If you had a weak man, you wouldn\u2019t have Israel right now. Israel would have been, you know, Israel, with most other leaders, would not exist today.\"",
      "Netanyahu reiterated his praise of Trump after their meeting, announcing that Israel would award him the Israel Prize, the country's highest honor. Netanyahu said it would be the first time the prize has been awarded to a non-Israeli.",

      "Russia on Monday promised to retaliate against Ukraine after it said nearly 100 drones had targeted one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, likely throwing a wrench into President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to end the nearly four-year war.",
      "\"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered. The targets for retaliatory strikes and the timing of their implementation by the Russian armed forces have been determined,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said without offering details of the alleged attacks in the region of Novgorod.",
      "Soon after, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the claims a lie aimed at jeopardizing negotiations. Russia would most likely use the alleged attack to launch strikes at government buildings in Kyiv, the capital, he added.",
      "Trump later told reporters that he \"just heard\" about the attack alleged by Russia.",
      "\u201cThat would be too bad. That would not be good,\u201d he said ahead of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",

      "The Ukrainian leader said Trump was now offering Kyiv legally binding security guarantees that would last for 15 years, though he had asked for them to remain in place for up to half a century.",
      "\u201cI told him that we have been at war for almost 15 years, and therefore we would very much like the guarantees to be longer,\u201d Zelenskyy said, referring to Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and backing of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east before a full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "He said Trump indicated he would consider longer guarantees, adding that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the \u201cpresence\u201d of partners.",

      "Ukraine still controls a chunk of Donbas and has vowed it won't give up that land, but Russia wants the whole region \u2014 a major demand that Putin has shown no desire to compromise on. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe\u2019s largest, is occupied by Russia but each side wants control of it in a deal.",
      "American negotiators have previously floated the concept of establishing a \u201cfree economic zone\u201d in Donbas, but Zelenskyy said Monday there is \u201cno detailed concept\u201d of how that would work yet, and that Ukrainian society would need to be consulted on any such agreement.",
      "In fact, he said the whole 20-point peace plan should be put to a referendum in Ukraine, which he said would require a ceasefire of at least 60 days.",

      "As Kyiv presses Trump to deliver security guarantees, questions remain over whether the Florida summit marks a genuine turning point or another round of high-stakes diplomacy with little for Zelenskyy to take home.",
      "Eight months ago, a White House meeting in February ended in acrimony and failed to produce the breakthrough Trump had promised on \u201cday one\u201d of his administration.",
      "European leaders flanked Zelenskyy on his next visit to the White House in August as they grappled for a voice in the faltering negotiations, but Europe has since remained largely shut out of high-level talks as Russia refuses to budge from its maximalist demands.",
      "There now appear to be signals from the Ukrainian camp that Kyiv may be prepared to compromise with Moscow.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday in a Telegram post that \u201cmuch can be decided before the New Year,\u201d but \u201cwhether decisions will be made depends on our partners.\u201d",
      "Last week, he outlined elements of an updated proposal that would see Ukraine potentially withdraw troops from parts of the east without recognizing captured areas as Russian territory, with a demilitarized zone established in their place.",
      "Such suggestions had previously appeared to be red lines in peace talks. Until Tuesday, Zelenskyy had maintained that he would be unwilling to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland, much of which has been occupied by Russian forces, as part of any plan to end the war.",
      "But he has remained firm on another issue.",
      "Zelenskyy said the question of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, aimed at preventing further Russian incursions, would ultimately depend on the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That said, Ukraine\u2019s history underscores the dangers of relying on security assurances as a long-term solution. The Budapest Memorandum, signed in 1994 in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons, committed the U.S. and Russia to respecting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "It was shattered in 2014 with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and incursions in eastern Ukraine, followed by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago, which sparked the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "It remains unclear whether Zelenskyy\u2019s optimism is widely shared. He presented a united front with European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney after meetings on Saturday, though there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough.",
      "While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said countries would work toward a \u201cshared objective,\u201d divisions have blown up in recent weeks over since-dropped plans to hand seized Russian assets to Ukraine.",
      "And it\u2019s unclear how Russian President Vladimir Putin, and even Trump himself, will ultimately respond to Zelenskyy\u2019s latest peace offerings.",
      "Putin told some of Russia\u2019s top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces in Ukraine, but that he wanted full control of the Donbas region, the Kommersant newspaper reported on Friday.",
      "\u201cVladimir Putin asserted that the Russian side is still ready to make the concessions that he made in Anchorage. In other words, that \u2018Donbas is ours,\u2019\u201d Kommersant reported. In essence, Putin wants the whole of Donbas, though outside that area \u201ca partial exchange of territories from the Russian side is not ruled out,\u201d wrote columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.",
      "Such hard-line demands, held by Putin throughout the conflict, still appear well at odds with Zelenskyy\u2019s pathway to peace.",
      "While demilitarized zones remain a possibility, Zelenskyy said Ukraine and the United States have not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas it still controls.",
      "After heavy Russian strikes hit Kyiv across the weekend, killing two and injuring dozens more, Zelenskyy said Saturday that Putin is not interested in peace, accusing him of seeking to prolong the war and \u201cuse every opportunity to cause Ukraine even greater suffering.\u201d",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has remained publicly noncommittal. Asked about Zelenskyy\u2019s visit, he told Politico: \u201cWe will see what he\u2019s got.\u201d",
      "A Ukrainian official familiar with the planning for Sunday\u2019s meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump told NBC News that in addition to security guarantees for Ukraine, the Ukrainians are preparing to discuss economic prosperity and reconstruction of the war-torn country.",
      "There are also talks of holding a joint news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, not necessarily to announce anything new, but to discuss the results of the meeting, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "Still, expectations persist that there will be something new for the duo to say Sunday, after years of deadlock and over a million dead.",

      "\u201cZelenskyy has clearly demonstrated his willingness to compromise, to come to a sort of an agreement, especially when there\u2019s perspective for future stability with U.S. security guarantees,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cThe big question remains, is Russia really willing to concede or to agree to an honest peace plan on terms that are also acceptable to Ukraine?\u201d",

      "The provocative French melodrama about a voluptuous teenager who scandalizes Saint-Tropez was a box office smash both abroad and in the United States, despite mixed critical reviews and condemnation by watchdog groups like the National Legion of Decency.",
      "Dubbed a \u201csex kitten\u201d by British film producer Tony Tenser, Bardot broke through as the so-called sexual revolution was underway, women were embracing birth control, and many moviegoers were searching for racier fare.",

      "Two years later, Bardot married actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she had her only child \u2014 a son named Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, who was born in January 1960.",
      "Bardot, in her memoir, wrote that she was \u201cnot made to be a mother.\u201d She wrote that her unborn child was like a \u201ccancerous tumor\u201d that she tried to remove by punching herself in the stomach.",
      "When that marriage broke up after three years, Charrier got custody of their son.",
      "Father and son later sued Bardot for the \u201churtful remarks\u201d in the memoir and were awarded $36,200 in damages.",
      "Bardot and her son, who lives in Norway, later reconciled. And she met her grandchildren and great-granddaughter.",
      "Her three-year marriage to Sachs in 1966 was also marked by multiple infidelities, but it ended in an amicable divorce.",
      "\u201cA year with Bardot was worth 10 with anyone else,\u201d Sachs reportedly said after the marriage was over.",
      "Bardot, in public statements, rarely revisited her acting career once it was over. In a 2007 interview, she appeared to be at a loss when asked how she came to be an icon of French cinema.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that I arrived and left at the right time. My wild and free side unsettled some, and unwedged others.\u201d"

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is en route to the U.S. via Canada ahead of a weekend of high-stakes diplomacy and a renewed push for peace amid deadly Russian bombing on Ukraine\u2019s capital.",
      "Zelenskyy is set to meet with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday, after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and phone calls with European leaders Saturday.",
      "As Trump ups pressure to bring the war to an end, Zelenskyy said that the critical issue of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, to prevent a further Russian incursion, would hinge on the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "If Russia \u201cturns even the Christmas and New Year period into a time of destroyed homes and burned apartments, of ruined power plants, then this sick activity can only be responded to with truly strong steps,\u201d he posted on X earlier as he embarked on the trip. \u201cThe United States has this capability. Europe has this capability.\u201d",
      "In addition to meeting with Trump and Carney, Zelenskyy said he would talk remotely with European leaders to \u201cexchange the details of the documents I will be discussing with the President of the United States.\u201d",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will attend the online meeting, a European Commission spokesperson told NBC News.",
      "European leaders have largely been sidelined in the main negotiations between the U.S., Ukraine and Russia.",
      "They have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. But longtime American allies in Europe have struggled to balance mounting pressure from Washington with their reluctance to give in to Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "A Ukrainian official familiar with the planning for Sunday\u2019s meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump told NBC News that in addition to security guarantees for Ukraine, the Ukrainians are preparing to discuss economic prosperity and reconstruction of the war-torn country.",
      "There are also talks of holding a joint news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, not necessarily to announce anything new, but to discuss the results of the meeting, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "In a WhatsApp chat with Ukrainian journalists on Friday, Zelenskyy said, \u201cThe 20-point plan we have been working on is 90% ready,\u201d and negotiating teams in Ukraine and the U.S. had made \u201csignificant progress.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur task is to make sure everything is 100% ready,\u201d he added. \u201cWith each such meeting and each such conversation, we must bring the desired result closer.\u201d",
      "Trump has made a high-level diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into Moscow\u2019s and Kyiv\u2019s widely differing positions and demands, while Russia remains unrelenting in its offensive.",
      "Heavy Russian shelling and explosions struck Kyiv and the surrounding region early Saturday morning, killing at least two people and injuring 20 more, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, who added that more than 10 residential buildings in the city had been damaged.",
      "The strikes caused the temporary closure of two airports in southeastern Poland after the Polish air force scrambled fighter jets, the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency said on X.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that 500 Russian drones and 40 missiles had struck the nation.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched a full-scale invasion of Russia\u2019s much smaller neighbor in February 2022, has not backed off maximalist demands that would see Ukraine blocked from integrating with the West and limit its ability to defend itself. Until Tuesday, Zelenskyy had maintained that he would be unwilling to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland, much of which has been occupied by Russian forces, as part of a plan to end the war.",
      "The Ukrainian leader has since given details of an updated peace plan offering Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarized zone in their place.",
      "Trump told Politico Friday that he anticipated a \u201cgood\u201d meeting with the Ukrainian leader, though he offered no endorsement of Zelenskyy\u2019s plan.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything until I approve it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s got.\u201d"

      "On the side of a dusty road in Gaza, dozens of mostly young men gather against the counter of a makeshift storefront. Under a canvas roof, the acrylic display cases are filled with boxes of high-end cellphones.",
      "It is a surreal spectacle: Palestinians, many displaced from their bombed-out homes, malnourished, sick and jobless in this collapsed economy, being sold the recently released iPhone 17 Pro. Even budget phones have been selling for as much as 5,000 shekels \u2014 around $1,500 \u2014 according to customers in Gaza, where prices have spiked to 10 times those in other countries.",
      "That such luxury items are in supply, but often food or medicine is still scarce, is exasperating aid workers and Palestinians. Experts interviewed for this story said Israel\u2019s border controls often make commercial goods easier to transport than humanitarian aid. Though the flow has increased during the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the United Nations and other groups say they are still facing serious restrictions on urgent items.",
      "\u201cWe cannot even afford food \u2014 how are we supposed to afford phones?\u201d asked Samir Kamal Awad Abou Dakaa, 52, who was a construction worker before the war and has a wife and five children to feed.",
      "His family lives in a tent encampment in the southern city of Khan Younis, where his kids are given Arabic lessons using a scrap of blackboard and fed rice at a local soup kitchen. His faded blue track jacket, thinning hair and quiet voice betray what he calls a \u201cbeyond difficult\u201d life.",
      "This contrast is not new for Gaza, said Mona Jebril, a research fellow at England\u2019s University of Cambridge who lived in the territory for 22 years. \u201cBefore the war and during the siege, there were mobile phones and expensive cars. But because of the extra restrictions on the borders, the massive devastation and humanitarian catastrophe, then this paradox comes to light even more.\u201d",
      "This is the latest twist in efforts to get aid into Gaza during a patchy ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. While President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan appears to be holding, albeit with regular Israeli airstrikes, the crisis endures.",
      "Nearly all of the population of some 2 million has been displaced, 80% of the buildings have been destroyed or damaged, and 9,000 children were hospitalized for malnutrition in October alone, according to the U.N.",
      "The ceasefire has changed things. Some 65,000 pallets of aid came into Gaza during the first month of the ceasefire, the U.N. said, double the previous four weeks. But essential equipment, such as forklift trucks and mobile storage units, is still being \u201csystematically rejected by Israeli authorities,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said. Medical equipment, food parcels and solar lighting, meanwhile, are still being \u201cblocked from entry at scale\u201d by Israeli restrictions, administrative controls and logistics backlogs, OCHA said.",
      "An analysis of Israeli figures by The Associated Press earlier this month showed there has been a shortfall in aid deliveries, with Israel agreeing to let in 600 trucks per day but the true daily average totaling 459."
