    "summary": "Trump said he was granting the two US neighbours a temporary exemption on tariffs that he imposed two days ago.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week.",
      "It is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from the US's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets.",
      "On Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump.",
      "The US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports.",
      "Trudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief.",
      "\"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said.",
      "Sheinbaum said she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way.",
      "The carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term.",
      "Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.",
      "The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.",
      "A White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order.",
      "The White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world.",
      "As US and Canada trade barbs, it's so far so good for Mexico's Sheinbaum",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence.",
      "The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, ended down nearly 1.8% on Thursday.",
      "George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said the \"hokey cokey\" with Trump's tariffs has it made it \"nigh on impossible\" for firms to manage their production lines and is \"putting pressure on the US economy\".",
      "Meanwhile, he said it is \"galvanising a response from Europe, especially Germany, so we've seen a more positive reaction to European markets\".",
      "In signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market.",
      "\"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\"",
      "'Numbskull'",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\".",
      "Earlier, as relief looked likely but before it was announced, he told CNN that the province still planned to go ahead with a 25% tariff on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota from Monday.",
      "\"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday dismissed retaliation as counter-productive for trade negotiations.",
      "\"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday.",
      "Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade.",
      "Trump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada.",
      "About $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide.",
      "\"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said.",
      "In the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies.",
      "Imports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (\u00a3100bn), the Commerce Department reported.",
      "Gregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium.",
      "But Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices \u2013 a sign that the economy is holding up.",
      "\"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".",

      "\"Enough is enough,\" she said.",
      "Terry used his redundancy money to take over the Hockley Post Office in Stockport in 2005.",
      "But less than two years later, he was suspended for alleged shortfalls.",

    "summary": "Despite opposition investors are still looking at deep-sea mining technology.",
    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises.",
      "Some of Trump's allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing.",

      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's latest move has left investors in a spin - for good reason.",
      "With the stroke of a pen, the tariffs he has imposed on Canada, Mexico and China have turned back the clock 70 years, erasing decades of globalisation.",
      "Tariffs, he says is a beautiful word, signalling jobs and riches for America.",
      "However, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.",
      "These extra taxes mean that Americans are facing the highest level of tariffs on goods being imported to their country since the 1930s.",
      "Vegetables from Mexico, wheat from Canada, toys and T-shirts from China are all in the firing line. Retailers of such items can have very narrow profit margins and will raise prices quickly to cover the tariffs.",
      "Consumers will notice the price rises.",
      "Groceries may be one of Trump's favourite words, but his own electorate may not appreciate the increase in bills they could face. Assuming no further tariffs, economists suggest US inflation, already higher than expected, could rise further in the second half of this year.",
      "A price worth paying \"to make America great again\"? Look no further than the laundry room for a cautionary tale.",
      "During his first-term of office in 2018, Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines after American producer Whirlpool complained about cheap South Korean competition.",
      "Those rivals - Samsung and LG - then set up in America, creating close to 2,000 jobs.",
      "But at what price? An imported washing machine cost an American shopper almost a third more at the start of 2023, just before tariffs were abolished, than five years previously.",
      "Add up the costs of tariffs and one study claims each of those jobs cost Americans the equivalent of more than $800,000 (\u00a3627,000).",
      "Those tariffs of course meant revenue for American governments and that source has increased dramatically in recent years, following the raft of tariffs Trump also imposed in his first term on China - most of which were retained under President Joe Biden.",
      "However, the amount netted is equivalent to a tax rise on American households of up to $300. Ultimately it is they who are footing the bill - and will continue to do so.",
      "Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Then consider the impact on American manufacturers who have businesses spanning Canada, Mexico and perhaps even China. Overall, economists think we could be looking at a hit to US growth of up to 1% - not enough to prompt a recession, but unwelcome nonetheless.",
      "In sheer numbers terms, the hit to the Canadian economy could be greater, economists say. It sells more than $400bn worth of goods to America every year, accounting for a fifth of its income.",
      "But it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.",
      "The damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.",
      "All of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.",
      "China, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere.",
      "Ironically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets.",
      "Countries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.",
      "A key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.",
      "If the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.",
      "As it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.",
      "And that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs.",
      "Weaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil."

      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",

      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",

      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "Leading child doctors have joined calls for a complete ban on smacking children in England, saying there is no evidence it has any positive effect on their wellbeing.",
      "Currently, smacking is unlawful in England, except in cases where it amounts to a \"reasonable punishment\".",
      "Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament.",
      "The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life.",
      "Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\"",
      "If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England.",

      "Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022.",
      "Prof Rowland said there were 67 countries around the world which had already adopted smacking bans, with a further 20 committing to do so.",
      "The government said it was \"looking closely\" at the changes made in Scotland and Wales, but had no plans to legislate on smacking at this stage.",

      "Mum Leanne Casey, said parents \"should be able to discipline how they see fit\", but added: \"I don't agree with smacking children though, so if a ban is what it takes then I'd agree that is what you need to do.\"",
      "Dad Oli Harrison said he would \"never intervene\" in another person's parenting methods, but added that a ban would \"probably be beneficial\" to avoid it being seen as a \"grey area\".",
      "When looking at populations as a whole, Prof Rowland said physical punishment \"undoubtedly harms children's health\".",
      "He said there were no scientific studies which provided robust evidence that smacking had any positive effect on children's wellbeing.",
      "Calls for a ban on smacking intensified after the death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif.",

      "Her father, who had fled to Pakistan after the murder, had phoned police in England claiming he had \"legally punished\" Sara before her death.",
      "It is unlawful in England to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm, or cruelty, but Prof Rowland said academic studies had shown children who were punished physically were at an increased risk of serious physical assault.",
      "He said a complete ban on smacking would make it easier for the authorities to \"draw a line and say there are never any circumstances involved where physical punishment of children is ever legal\".",
      "Other organisations, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have also backed the amendment.",
      "Joanna Barrett, from the charity, said smacking had been associated with \"depression, anxiety, increased aggression, and antisocial behaviour\".",

      "Not everyone agrees. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell on Thursday, Simon Calvert from campaign group Be Reasonable challenged the doctors' calls.",
      "He argued that unreasonable chastisement, such as beating a child, was already illegal, and voiced concerns the proposal could mean \"a mum tapping a tot on the back of the hand\" faces criminal prosecution.",

    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "The group, who previously reached the quarter-finals of The Voice, will head to Switzerland this May with a song called What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "Calling themselves \"pop girlies with a little bit of yeehaw\", the band was formed by school friends Lauren Byrne, Holly-Anne Hull and Charlotte Steel in 2013.",
      "In a press release, they said: \"We're going to be the first girlband to represent the UK since 1999, which feels like such a crazy honour. We're going to bring loads of fun, energy and hopefully do something that you won't have seen before on the Eurovision stage.\"",
      "Premiering their song on BBC Radio 2, the band added: \"We feel like we're on another planet. Nothing is sinking in.\"",
      "Live: Reaction to the UK's Eurovision entry",
      "Live: Reaction to the UK's Eurovision entry",
      "They'll be hoping to improve on Olly Alexander's performance at last year's Eurovision Song Contest. His song, Dizzy, took 18th place after receiving the dreaded \"nul points\" in the public vote.",
      "He was only saved from last place by the jury vote - where professional musicians and songwriters awarded him 46 points.",
      "But the former Years and Years star shrugged off the loss with typical good humour.",
      "Playing at Radio 1's Big Weekend Festival a month later, he introduced Dizzy as \"the 18th most popular song at Eurovision.\"",
      "What does the UK Eurovision entry sound like?",
      "Remember Monday's song is markedly different from the decadent electro-pop of Dizzy. In fact, it's in an entirely different realm.",
      "Try to imagine, if you can, that Abba and Sam Ryder have teamed up with the cast of Six: The Musical, got blackout drunk and tried to recreate Bohemian Rhapsody from memory. (This is a compliment.)",
      "There are a dizzying array of key changes and tempo shifts, but with every corner they turn, the band find another hook - with the soaring chorus a particular highlight.",
      "Remember Monday wrote the song with Brit Award nominees, Billen Ted, who've previously worked with Little Mix and Anne Marie; Thomas Stengaard, who wrote Denmark's 2013 Eurovision winner, Only Teardrops; and pop artist Julie 'Kill J' Aagaard.",
      "It opens with a gently strummed mandolin, and a story about the terror and euphoria of being so partied-out you can't remember the night before.",
      "\"Someone lost a shoe, I'm still in last night's make-up,\" they sing. \"I'm waking up like, 'What's this new tattoo?'",
      "\"Room is spinning, ears are ringin'... I'm clutching my pearls like, What The Hell Just Happened?\"",
      "At that moment, the song explodes into a baroque rock opera, all power chords and chunky harmonies, before jumping into a double-time groove that recalls Laura Branigan's 1980s hit Gloria, or Billy Joel's My Life.",
      "Over the next two minutes, we find out more about the band's debauched night out. Heels were broken, strangers were snogged, swimming pools were depth-charged.",
      "\"In my defence it's been a real hard year,\" they protest, before delivering the killer blow: \"You can blame my ex.\"",
      "It's a quirky, catchy girls-together anthem - and the biggest creative risk the UK has taken at Eurovision for years.",
      "But will it be enough to push Remember Monday up the rankings?",
      "What's the competition?",
      "The trio will arrive at the contest with high hopes. They're seasoned performers who, crucially, can deliver precise three-part harmonies in a live setting. All three have performed on the West End, in shows including Phantom Of The Opera, Matilda and Mary Poppins.",
      "The trio also have a vibrant presence on social media - notably on their TikTok channel, where they defiantly sing the insults that people leave under their YouTube videos.",
      "If they can bring that spirit to the contest, and the pre-parties that take place across Europe in the next two months, they're sure to win over a few voters.",
      "The competition is already heating up, with only seven countries left to reveal their entries before the deadline of 10 March.",
      "Sweden is currently favourite to win - despite the fact their contestant won't be chosen until the final of their national selection competition, known as Melodifestivalen, on Saturday night.",
      "Among those contending for the honour are 2015 winner Mans Zelmerlow and comedy group KAJ, whose entry Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the joys of a sauna.",
      "The Netherlands, Finland and Estonia have also generated buzz for their submissions - which range from soul-searching ballads to stadium rock anthems.",
      "Meanwhile, Australia is hoping for a reversal of fortunes after being eliminated in last year's semi-finals.",
      "They're sending singer-songwriter Go-Jo, whose song Milkshake Man is a throbbing pop number laced with barely-disguised double entendres.",
      "Malta took a similar path with their song - which plays on the phonetic similarity between \"kant\", the Maltese word for singing, and a notorious swear word.",
      "However, the EBU has ruled that singer Miriana Conte, must change the title and the lyrics to avoid causing offence.",
      "Writing on Facebook, Conte said she was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the decision, \"especially since we have less than a week to submit the song\".",
      "However, she added, \"I promise you this: The show will go on \u2013 Diva NOT down.\"",
      "This year's contest will take place in Basel, Switzerland, after their act Nemo won in 2024.",
      "The ceremony was mired in controversy after participants were caught up in a row over Israel's inclusion.",
      "Protests were staged outside the event, and many artists made on-stage protests over Israel's military action in Gaza.",
      "Nemo later told the BBC that organisers had not done enough to support participants.",
      "\"I felt very alone,\" the Swiss singer said. \"I really hope they have things in place for the next year.\"",
      "The contest subsequently announced new wellbeing measures for 2025, including a code of conduct for participants, no-filming zones backstage, and the creation of a welfare producer."

      "US pop star Olivia Rodrigo and British band The 1975 will headline the Glastonbury festival this summer, organisers have announced.",
      "They will be joined by five-time Brit Award winner Charli XCX - who will top the bill on the festival's second stage on Saturday 28 June.",
      "There will also be debut Glastonbury performances by Alanis Morisette, Noah Kahan, Gracie Abrams, Lola Young and US rap phenomenon Doechii, who will headline the West Holts stage. Returning favourites include Wolf Alice, Wet Leg, Fatboy Slim, Loyle Carner and Scissor Sisters.",
      "Rock legend Neil Young has already been announced as the Saturday night headliner, with Rod Stewart playing the Sunday afternoon \"legend slot\".",

      "Sidetracked podcast: Annie Mac and Nick Grimshaw react to Glastonbury's headliners",
      "The 1975 reach top of the bill",
      "Cheshire's The 1975 are festival veterans, who have headlined the Reading and Leeds festival three times since 2016 - but this will be their first time at the top of Glastonbury's line-up.",
      "Balancing hooky dance-rock with more experimental forays into electronica and even ambient music, they pepper their lyrics with references to online relationships, chemical dependency and wry, self-aware humour.",
      "Frontman Matty Healy is known for his provocative, and often divisive, actions. On their recent tour, he has been spotted chewing raw steak, berating security guards via Auto-Tune, and passionately kissing fans in the front row.",
      "More seriously, the band are being sued by organisers of a Malaysian festival, which was shut down after Healy kissed one of his bandmates on stage.",
      "The singer said he was protesting at the country's anti-LGBT laws, under which homosexual acts can be punished by 20 years in prison.",
      "\"I feel like they'll be great headliners,\" said BBC 6 Music's Nick Grimshaw, speaking on the Sidetracked podcast.",
      "\"They have great taste and great vision - and they're a band who will think about do a bespoke show.\"",
      "Olivia's rapid rise",
      "Rodrigo is the first Glastonbury headliner to have broken through in the 2020s - and the second-youngest solo headliner of all time, after Billie Eilish, who was 20 when she topped the bill in 2022.",
      "Like Eilish, the 22-year-old will play the Pyramid Stage with just two albums to her name, but she has a solid armoury of fist-pumping pop-punk singalongs (Good 4 U, Brutal, Get Him Back), alongside lighters-aloft ballads like Driver's License and Vampire.",
      "An accomplished live performer, her 2024 Guts tour banked $186m (\u00a3144m) in ticket sales; and she will also headline the BST festival in London's Hyde Park two days before Glastonbury.",
      "Rodrigo last played the festival in 2022, drawing a huge - and noticeably young - crowd to the Other Stage.",
      "During that performance, she brought out Lily Allen to perform the expletive-laden track F You, dedicating it to the US Supreme Court justices who had, a day earlier, ended the constitutional right to abortion in America.",
      "Charli's next Brat summer",
      "Rumours that Rihanna would play the Pyramid Stage turned out to be wishful thinking for the second year running.",
      "But Charli XCX will cement her position as one of the UK's biggest pop stars with her set on the Other Stage.",
      "She returns to the festival after winning five Brit Awards for her deliberately trashy seventh album, Brat.",
      "Playing the Other Stage will release her from the requirement to tone down her set for audiences on BBC One, and indulge in the frenetic, hedonistic club sounds that made her name.",
      "\"The Other Stage is traditionally more of a home for electronic music,\" said Annie Mac on Sidetracked. \"It makes so much sense for her to counteract the Neil Young set on Saturday night.\"",
      "Charli's set also marks the latest step in the star's journey through Glastonbury's smaller stages, starting at the Silver Hayes dance arena in 2014.",
      "\"I was really ill and I forgot to wear a bra on stage, which was good!\" she later told the BBC about her debut..",
      "\"[Radio 1 DJ] Huw Stephens came on during the last song and told me I was singing live on the radio. I lost my voice and it was all a bit crazy, but it was fun.\"",
      "Hopefully she'll avoid the lurgy this summer.",
      "More acts added",
      "Other acts announced for Glastonbury 2025 include Ezra Collective, Jorja Smith, The Libertines, The Maccabees, Franz Ferdinand, Kae Tempest, Beabadoobee, Kneecap and The Prodigy.",
      "Pop star Raye will also play just before Neil Young on the Saturday night, following her breakthrough set at lunchtime on the Pyramid Stage just two years ago.",

    "story": [
      "Influential soul, jazz and funk producer and composer Roy Ayers has died at the age of 84.",
      "In a statement posted on Facebook, his family said: \"It is with great sadness that the family of legendary vibraphonist, composer, and producer Roy Ayers announce his passing which occurred on March 4 2025 in New York City after a long illness.\"",
      "They described him as \"highly influential and sought after as a music collaborator.\"",
      "Ayers' own biggest hit was the mellow track Everybody Loves the Sunshine, which was covered by artists like d'Angelo and sampled by others including Mary J Blige and Tyler, the Creator.",
      "But he was so much more than his best-known record. A pioneer of nu-soul and jazz funk, he was a key figure in the 90s acid jazz movement.",
      "Happy and Blurred Lines singer Pharrell Williams has described him as one of his greatest musical inspirations.",
      "Ayers had a huge influence on many RnB and hip-hop stars, particularly in the 90s, with artists like Tribe Called Quest, Mary J Blige and Jill Scott sampling his earlier work on tracks like Bonita Applebaum, My Life and Watching Me.",
      "He also worked with Guru and The Roots. Erykah Badu called him \"the king of neo soul\".",
      "More recently, Calvin Harris told BBC Radio 2 that Ayers \"just stood out, his music is amazing and just so intricate... everything just sounds so rich and warm\".",
      "Ayers performed at Glastonbury several times; his last performance there was in 2019.",
      "He also wrote and produced the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Coffy starring Pam Grier.",
      "Ayers could play several instruments, including the flute and trumpet but he became synonymous with the vibraphone, a percussion instrument that looks similar to a xylophone but has a set of metal bars rather than wood.",
      "His other hits include Running Away and Searchin', with his band Roy Ayers Ubiquity, who were also behind Everybody Loves the Sunshine.",
      "Musical family",
      "Roy Edward Ayers Jr was born into a musical family in Los Angeles on 10 September 1940.",
      "His mum Ruby was a school teacher and piano teacher, while his dad, Roy Sr, was a parking attendant and trombonist.",
      "Ayers began playing the piano at the age of five and went on to play several instruments and sing in the church choir before plumping for the vibraphone.",
      "Jazz star Lionel Hampton may have had something to do with that. Ayers attended a Lionel Hampton Big Band concert when he was just five. Quite taken by Ayers's enthusiasm and delight at the performance, Hampton gifted the youngster a pair of vibe mallets.",
      "Ayers formed his first group while at Jefferson High School, aptly named the Jefferson Combo, and later studied advanced music theory at college.",
      "He became a professional musician in 1961.",
      "He went on to record three albums with jazz flautist Herbie Mann before forming Roy Ayers Ubiquity and landing the hit Everybody Loves the Sunshine in 1976, from the album of the same name.",
      "His last solo album, Mahogany Vibes, featuring Badu, came out in 2004.",
      "Ayers is survived by his wife Argerie, and their children Mtume and Ayana Ayers.",
      "The Facebook post on Ayers's page added: \"His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming.\""

      "The novel, released on 28 August, will reunite readers with Dolphin and Star, who spent their childhood dealing with their mother, Marigold's bipolar disorder.",
      "Dolphin, 33, is struggling to move on. Living in a bedsit, working at a tattoo parlour and often collecting her mother from the police station, she hopes romance will save her but is torn between stable Lee and his daughter Ava or a fling with actor Joel. Star, meanwhile, works as a doctor, in Scotland with her family.",
      "Wilson told Scott Mills on BBC Radio 2's Breakfast Show, on Thursday, World Book Day, she \"can't wait\" for reactions to the new book.",
      "Jacqueline Wilson 'delighted to be viewed as gay icon' after coming out",
      "The much-loved author, 79, made a dame in 2008, is known for writing about difficult and dark issues in accessible ways.",
      "Most of her books, some of which explore suicide, mental health and domestic violence, are aimed at children aged between seven and 12.",
      "But Picture Imperfect follows Wilson's first novel for adults since the 1970s, Think Again, released last year as a sequel to the Girls series.",
      "It became the bestselling adult debut hardback of 2024, according to The Bookseller.",
      "\"I discovered what fun it is... it's like a party game - thinking about your childhood favourites that you wrote about,\" she told Mills of writing for adults.",
      "\"And one of the books that people have mentioned over the years is The Illustrated Mum\".",
      "The original book, named after Marigold's wealth of tattoos, from which Dolphin and Star are named, won the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize in 2000.",
      "It was adapted into a film starring Michelle Collins in 2003.",
      "Announcing Picture Imperfect on social media, Wilson unveiled a statue of herself covered in tattoos, in Brighton, near her Sussex home, which is set to be moved to a Waterstones in the city.",
      "The author, who will also visit seaside towns across the country for the release of her children's book The Seaside Sleepover next month, told Mills she planned to go in and stroke the statue occasionally.",
      "The Illustrated Mum is Wilson's second-highest-selling children's novel in paperback in the UK, according to publisher Penguin Random House, topped only by her children's classic Tracy Beaker.",
      "Mills also shared messages from fans - including Dani Harmer, who starred in the 2000s BBC TV adaptation of Tracy Beaker, and its various spin-offs.",
      "Her daughter Avery Bell, eight, was Wilson's \"new biggest fan\", she revealed.",
      "\"It has just been an absolute joy to re-read all of your books with her,\" Harmer said.",
      "\"We... now discuss them as well and go over all of the amazing topics that you cover in your books.\"",

    "story": [
      "A police force \"acted reasonably\" during a hate crime investigation into a social media post by the Daily Telegraph journalist Allison Pearson, a report states.",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) looked into Essex Police's actions after Pearson claimed she felt \"bullied and threatened\" when officers visited the columnist's home on Remembrance Sunday in November 2024.",
      "The force has previously defended its since-dropped investigation over an allegation that a social media post, about the Hamas-Israel conflict, incited racial hatred.",
      "Responding on X, Ms Pearson accused Essex Police of \"marking their own homework in my case which was widely viewed as utterly outrageous\".",
      "In his findings, Mark Hobrough, the NPCC's hate crime lead and chief constable of Gwent, said footage from a body-worn camera showed the investigating officer's approach to Pearson was \"polite and carried out in an exemplary manner\".",
      "The original investigation was sparked by a complaint by a member of the public that a social media post in the early weeks of the Middle East conflict contained critical remarks about the police.",
      "\"The posted image was likely to mislead the reader into thinking this was from a pro-Palestine rally, whether intended to do so, or unintentionally so,\" the report said.",
      "'How dare they?'",
      "The report redacts details of the now-deleted post, from 16 November 2023, which the BBC has seen.",
      "It shows an image of two police officers standing next to two men holding what appears to be a flag of the Pakistani political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).",
      "Pearson's post tags the Metropolitan Police alongside the words \"how dare they?\".",
      "It added: \"Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.\"",
      "X added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it was \"not related to Palestine\".",
      "The report, which redacts Pearson's name, stated an officer went to her home and on his recording of the discussion \"clearly states he is there to try to arrange a voluntary attendance interview, to assist the investigation into a complaint of inciting racial hatred\".",
      "Pearson \"began to challenge the officer's actions\", the report adds.",
      "\"She implied that a complaint would be made to the Chief Constable by the Telegraph newspaper.\"",
      "The timing of the visit, early on a Sunday morning, could be judged inconsiderate, but the officer had already made a previous, unanswered visit and was \"diligently trying to conduct his workload\", the report added.",
      "\"Our view is that the officer's behaviour during this interaction was exemplary,\" the report adds.",
      "\"He did not become defensive or challenging and remained calm and polite throughout the interaction.\"",
      "The home visit was reported in the media, the report adds, with much of the reporting referring to as a \"non-crime hate incident\", \"despite a clear explanation [from the officer] that he was investigating an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online.\"",
      "The report praised Essex Police for the way it supported officers and its \"valiant attempt to maintain public confidence\" with its own media releases.",
      "'Totally outrageous'",
      "Pearson did not attend the voluntary police interview and the case was closed when the CPS concluded there was not a realistic prospect of conviction for the offence of stirring up racial hatred under the Public Order Act or the Communications Act.",
      "The report noted that the force, on reviewing the CPS decision, concluded that no crime had been committed.",
      "\"We do not take the view that a crime did not take place,\" the report states, \"rather that there was no realistic prospect of conviction based on the evidence available.\"",
      "The NPCC found Essex Police \"acted reasonably\" in its handling of the complaint but the force should have had a \"more active approach\" in categorising the crime, to avoid ambiguity.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme soon after the case was discontinued, Pearson said she did not think her tweet was wrong, and added: \"I won't censor myself but I will be more watchful in the future.\"",
      "The police visit to her home was not \"standard practice\" and was \"absolutely unacceptable\", she claimed.",
      "She added: \"Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader and many other people in the law, in politics, in normal walks of life, have said that is totally outrageous.\"",
      "Posting the BBC's story on X on Thursday, she said: \"Here are the police marking their own homework in my case which was widely viewed as utterly outrageous.",
      "\"And was rejected instantly by the CPS.",
      "\"A clear breach of my right to freedom of expression.\"",
      "'High bar'",
      "Responding to the report, an Essex Police spokesman said: \"In November last year we launched an investigation into an alleged offence of inciting racial hatred relating to a social media post.",
      "\"We acted appropriately and proportionately and investigated the matter which resulted in us taking no further action.",
      "\"We 're sometimes faced with allegations of crime where people have strong opposing views and that is why it is essential for us to remain impartial.\"",
      "It said the review had been shared \"with all interested parties\" and had been scrutinised by the Office of the Police, Fire & Crime Commissioner.",
      "In an NPCC statement on Thursday, Mr Hobrough added: \"There is a high bar for prosecuting communication offences, which is substantially different than the grounds for recording and investigating an allegation.",

      "Scarlett Pavlovich accused Gaiman of raping and assaulting her while she was working for his family in New Zealand in 2022, and is seeking at least $7m (\u00a35.6m) damages.",
      "\"In no uncertain terms, Pavlovich's accusations are false,\" his filing said. \"The sexual scenarios she describes deliberately in graphic detail are invented. Any sexual conduct that occurred was in all ways consensual.\"",
      "Gaiman's legal papers also included WhatsApp messages which he says back up his case, in which Ms Pavlovich thanked him for a \"lovely lovely night\" and told him their relationship was \"consensual\".",
      "The British author's lawyers also said New Zealand police \"thoroughly investigated\" Ms Pavlovich's claims but found \"no merit\" in them and declined to file charges.",
      "In her lawsuit, Ms Pavlovich said she was befriended by Palmer when she was 22 and homeless in New Zealand. She was repeatedly assaulted by Gaiman after she started working for the couple, she claims.",
      "Ms Pavlovich alleges the former couple violated laws on federal human trafficking, with complaints of assault, battery and inflicting emotional distress against Gaiman and negligence against Palmer.",
      "Ms Pavlovich first made her allegations public in a Tortoise Media podcast in summer 2024, and was also one of eight women who made claims of assault, abuse and coercion to New York Magazine in January.",
      "In response to that article, Gaiman said: \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"",
      "A spokesman for Palmer has said: \"While Ms Palmer is profoundly disturbed by the allegations that Mr Gaiman has abused several women, at this time her primary concern is, and must remain, the wellbeing of her son and therefore, to guard his privacy, she has no comment on these allegations.\"",
      "Ms Pavlovich filed a lawsuit against Gaimain and Palmer in Wisconsin, and against Palmer in Massachusetts and New York.",
      "As well as insisting her allegations are untrue, Gaiman's lawyers say US courts do not have authority to adjudicate her lawsuit because the alleged assaults happened in New Zealand."

      "The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with \"Wildflower honey with honeycomb\" going on sale.",
      "We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower \"sprinkles\" are also part of the new range.",
      "Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan.",
      "\"When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,\" said Kaling.",
      "\"But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...\"'",

      "Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past.",

      "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.",
      "Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.",
      "US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.",
      "But no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.",
      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",
      "\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",
      "Best visual pun: This coat",
      "Teddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.",
      "Least practical dress: Jade Thirlwall",
      "Jade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all.",
      "As well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.",
      "Over the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.",
      "Sneakiest host: Jack Whitehall",
      "Jack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.",
      "As ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.",
      "\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.",
      "Later, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".",
      "\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"",
      "Speaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.",
      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

    "story": [
      "School and nursery staff in the most deprived areas of England will be asked to supervise young children while they brush their teeth, under a national toothbrushing programme.",
      "Schemes are already running in some schools - but now dedicated central funding will reach the poorest areas where children are most at risk of tooth decay, the government says.",
      "Dental experts said the move would \"save children from pain and the NHS a fortune\".",
      "But the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) union said caution was needed to avoid shifting \"what is ultimately a parental responsibility on to the burden on schools\".",
      "National supervised toothbrushing programmes have been running in Scotland since 2006 and Wales since 2009.",
      "And in Northern Ireland, some nursery staff have been supervising toothbrushing since 2016, in a funded programme targeting the poorest 20% of areas.",
      "Teachers and other staff demonstrate and help, without directly brushing the children's teeth, at some point during the school day.",
      "Tooth decay",
      "The idea, according to experts, is not to replace toothbrushing at home but to help build skills, good habits and confidence.",
      "But in England, provision is patchy, partly because of logistical problems but also a lack of staff and dedicated funding.",
      "About one out of every four five-year-olds in England has had tooth decay - and in poorer areas, it is one in three.",
      "Tooth decay is the most common reason five-to-nine-year-olds in England are admitted to hospital.",
      "And in many areas, access to an NHS dentist has become increasingly difficult.",
      "Abbie's daughter goes to a nursery in Bridlington where toothbrushing lessons already take place.",
      "She says her toddler was quite \"toothbrush shy\" but the scheme has helped.",
      "\"When we first started toothbrushing she refused to do it at home \u2013 it was a two person job.",
      "\"I think in nursery it is different, it is quite an event. They all do it together - it is quite social, they sing a song,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Bridlington only has one NHS dentist practice accepting patients. Her children and husband have had to register in a different town.",
      "'Lifelong impact'",
      "Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said focusing on prevention would help give children the best start in life.",
      "\"It is shocking that a third of five-year-olds in the most deprived areas have experience of tooth decay - something we know can have a lifelong impact on their health,\" he said.",
      "\"It's why we're delivering supervised toothbrushing to young children and families who are most in need of support, as part of our wider plans to revive the oral health of the nation.\"",
      "The government says it is also working to reform the dental contract, so dentists take on more NHS work.",
      "Children wait over year in pain for NHS tooth removal",
      "'Some six-year-olds have never seen a toothbrush'",
      "From April, local authorities will be given \u00a311m funding and asked to identify schools and nurseries most in need.",
      "The aim is to reach about 600,000 three-to-five-year-olds a year.",
      "For every \u00a31 spent on the scheme, \u00a33 in treatment costs will be avoided \u2013 adding up to more than \u00a334m over the next five years, the government says.",
      "Some children will use the 23 million toothbrushes and toothpastes donated by Colgate to the programme.",
      "The British Dental Association welcomed the move but said more needed to be done to tackle food marketing and labelling.",
      "Eddie Crouch, who chairs the association, said: \"Supervised toothbrushing is tried and tested policy that will save children from pain and our NHS a fortune.",
      "\"The only concern is why it's taken a century to get here.\"",
      "'Parental responsibility'",
      "Paul Whiteman, of the NAHT, agreed there was a crisis in children's dental health and the government was right to prioritise it.",
      "\"However, we cannot keep loading increasing expectations on schools,\" he said.",
      "\"Nor can we keep looking to schools to fix all of society's ills.",

    "story": [
      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",

      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

    "summary": "The cheap painkiller seems to help the immune system detect and destroy cancers.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists believe they have discovered how the cheap painkiller aspirin can stop cancers spreading.",
      "In animal experiments they showed the drug enhanced the ability of the immune system to fight back.",
      "The team at the University of Cambridge said it was an exciting and surprise discovery that could eventually lead to cancer patients being prescribed the drug - but not yet and people are advised against just taking the pills themselves.",
      "Regular aspirin comes with risks and trials are still trying to figure out which patients are most likely to benefit.",
      "Tantalising data from more than a decade ago showed people who were already taking a daily aspirin were more likely to survive if they were diagnosed with cancer.",
      "But how?",
      "It appears to centre on a moment of vulnerability for a cancer - when a lone cell breaks off from the original tumour and tries, like a seed on the wind, to spread elsewhere in the body.",
      "This process is called metastasis and is the cause of the majority of deaths from cancer.",
      "Part of our immune defences - a white blood cell called a T-cell - can swoop in and destroy the spreading cancer as it tries to take root.",
      "But the study showed that another part of our blood - the platelets that normally stop bleeding - were suppressing the T-cells and making it harder for them to take out the cancer.",
      "Aspirin disrupts the platelets and removes their influence over the T-cells so they can hunt out the cancer.",
      "Prof Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, told me: \"What we've discovered is that aspirin might work, surprisingly, by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and kill metastasizing cancer cells.\"",
      "He thinks the drug would work best in cancers that have been caught early and could be used after treatment such as surgery to help the immune system find any cancer that might already have spread.",
      "Should I take aspirin for cancer?",
      "The most natural question for anybody with cancer to ask is should they be taking aspirin.",
      "\"If you are a cancer patient, don't rush to your local pharmacy to buy aspirin just yet, but actively consider participation in ongoing or upcoming trials of aspirin,\" says Prof Mangesh Thorat, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "He says the study provided \"the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle\" in understanding how aspirin works, but there were still questions to answer.",
      "Aspirin can cause dangerous internal bleeding including strokes so the risks have to be balanced. It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.",
      "Some patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin.",
      "But it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too.",
      "These are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back.",
      "She said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\".",
      "However, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\".",
      "In the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.",
      "'Eureka moment'",
      "The discovery, published in the journal Nature, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.",
      "The team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.",
      "They were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.",
      "Further investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body.",
      "Dr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: \"It was a Eureka moment.",
      "\"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated.\"",

      "rapid tests which give a result in minutes and display a dark line if PSA is detected above a certain level",
      "The BBC analysed five rapid tests all bought online from different companies, using a blood sample taken on the same day.",
      "The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\".",
      "Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to \"screen\" for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules.",

      "A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l.",
      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",
      "\"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\"",

      "In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.",
      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",

      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",

    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

      "In an interview with the Daily Mail, Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe questioned Farage's approach to leading the party and said he would need the \"right people\" around him to \"deliver the goods\".",
      "Responding in an interview on TalkTV, Farage said Lowe was \"completely wrong\".",
      "Farage added that Reform UK was a \"positive party\" - and insisted his loyal following was a \"good thing\".",
      "\"We've got a lot of development to do, but we're absolutely not a protest party,\" Farage told the programme.",
      "When asked why Lowe had gone public with his remarks, Farage said: \"Perhaps he wants to be prime minister. Most people in politics do.\"",
      "He added: \"His comments are wrong, we are making gigantic strides.\"",
      "Reform UK won five seats in last year's general election and more than four million votes, the third-largest vote share of any party.",

      "\"Nigel is a fiercely independent individual and is extremely good at what we have done so far. He has got messianic qualities. Will those messianic qualities distill into sage leadership? I don't know.\"",

      "He says he \"had very mixed feelings\u2026given what had happened\" but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves \"doing your duty\".",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:07:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The announcement of new support for courts comes as two reports warn the justice system is struggling.",
    "story": [
      "Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.",
      "The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.",
      "The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.",
      "There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.",
      "Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.",
      "The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.",
      "Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.",
      "She said a cap on sitting days had a \"drastic effect\", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.",
      "A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was \"unprecedented\", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.",
      "\"The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,\" she told the Today programme.",
      "\"We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,\" she added.",
      "But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt \"out of reach\" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.",
      "One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.",
      "Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under \"immense pressure\" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.",
      "\"With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,\" she said.",
      "\"I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first.\"",
      "Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had \"accepted\" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.",
      "The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.",
      "Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: \"Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned.\"",
      "Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.",
      "\"We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years.\"",
      "Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of \"queues for justice\" were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that the state of courtrooms were in \"a pretty dire way\", and funding was also needed for upkeep.",
      "\"There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,\" she said."

      "Asked about Vance's comments later, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the vice-president did not call Britain a \"random country\".",

      "\"JD Vance is erasing from history the hundreds of British troops who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" she said.",
      "She later told the BBC Vance's comments \"were clearly referring to the UK and France\", adding that they were \"deeply disrespectful\".",
      "'Real offence'",
      "Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, a former British Army officer who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: \"The disrespect shown by the new US vice-president to the sacrifices of our service personnel is unacceptable.\"",

    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked \"several billion pounds\" in draft spending cuts to welfare ahead of her Spring Statement, according to the BBC.",
      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",
      "The OBR later concluded \u00a34bn of the \u00a312bn a year promised cuts had not been achieved.",

    "story": [
      "From speeches watched by millions to a position as her party's deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black appeared to be one of politics rising stars.",
      "However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.",
      "Black believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.",
      "The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.",
      "Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.",
      "She said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.",
      "\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.",
      "The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.",
      "She said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went.",
      "\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"",
      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",
      "\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland.",
      "\"It was like two in the morning and the phrase used was a 'an imminent death threat'.",
      "\"I don't know what I've done to make you viscerally hate me that much.\"",
      "Since politics she has performed a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival and spent time talking about politics on various TV shows and podcasts.",
      "There does not appear to be any second guessing about her decision to stand down though, as she enjoys a walk with her dog in the new documentary.",
      "\"People deserve a representative that wants to be there and I don't think that's me anymore.  I've done my bit,\" she says.",
      "\"Doing something normal on a Tuesday, going for a walk with my wee best pal, is much better than running around Westminster.\"",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

    "story": [
      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",
      "But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out.",
      "UK won't be derailed by Ukraine aid freeze - Rayner",
      "Ukraine's shock over US military aid pause",
      "It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together.",
      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",

      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",

      "After five leaps, it could land inside the crater with a camera to take the first images of the interior.",

      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",

      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",

      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",

      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",
      "Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.",
      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "It is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from the US's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets.",
      "On Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump.",
      "The US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports.",
      "Trudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief.",
      "\"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said.",
      "Sheinbaum said she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way.",
      "The carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term.",
      "Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide.",
      "The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.",
      "A White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order.",
      "The White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world.",

      "George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said the \"hokey cokey\" with Trump's tariffs has it made it \"nigh on impossible\" for firms to manage their production lines and is \"putting pressure on the US economy\".",
      "Meanwhile, he said it is \"galvanising a response from Europe, especially Germany, so we've seen a more positive reaction to European markets\".",
      "In signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market.",
      "\"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\"",
      "'Numbskull'",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\".",

      "\"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said.",

      "\"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday.",
      "Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade.",
      "Trump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada.",
      "About $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide.",
      "\"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said.",
      "In the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies.",
      "Imports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (\u00a3100bn), the Commerce Department reported.",
      "Gregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium.",
      "But Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices \u2013 a sign that the economy is holding up.",
      "\"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".",

    "story": [
      "After years of wrangling with authorities, students in Thailand can now let their hair down. Literally.",
      "On Wednesday, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court annulled a 50-year-old directive by the education ministry, which had previously set out rules on hairstyles for school students: short hair for boys and ear-length bobs for girls.",
      "In practice, hairstyle rules have been gradually relaxed across many schools. But some still used the 1975 junta-issued directive as a guideline, and would cut the hair of students who didn't adhere.",
      "The 1975 directive violated individual freedoms protected by the constitution and was out of touch with today's society, the court said.",
      "The court decision this week came in response to a petition, filed by 23 public school students in 2020, which argued that the 1975 directive was unconstitutional.",
      "Student activists have long campaigned for hairstyle rules to be relaxed, saying it infringes on their human dignity and personal freedom over their bodies.",
      "One of them is Panthin Adulthananusak, who recently graduated from university.",
      "\"In the eyes of kids like us back then\u2026 even though it seemed impossible, we wanted to do something,\" he told the BBC. \"If no student in Thai history rose up to challenge the power of the adults that suppressed us, it would be a lifelong embarrassment.\"",
      "In response to such campaigns, the education ministry in 2020 allowed students to have longer hairstyles - but there remained some restrictions. Boys' hair could not cover the nape of their necks, while girls with long hair had to tie it up.",
      "Those regulations were revoked in 2023, with then education minister Trinuch Thienthong announcing that students, parents and school authorities should negotiate their own common ground on what is acceptable for hairstyles in their schools.",
      "But through all these changes, some schools continued to follow the standard laid out in the original 1975 directive.",
      "Schools have traditionally associated short hair with discipline and tidiness - an argument that has been repeated by many social media users this week. But in recent years reports of schools banning bangs or dyed hair have sparked public outcry across Thailand.",
      "In some parts of the country, teachers are known to shoddily cut students' hair during morning assembly to punish them for flouting hairstyle rules. Such practices have continued even as education authorities warned teachers against it.",
      "In January, the Ministry of Education reiterated that it had repealed restrictions on hair length for all students, saying it recognised the \"importance of promoting diversity and fairness in all aspects of education\".",
      "Wednesday's court decision, which also says that schools' hairstyle rules should consider the freedom and dignity of students, reaffirms the official push to leave hair choices up to students themselves.",
      "But Panthin said the revoking of the decades-old directive \"still leaves a hole for schools to set their own rules\". In cases where schools have more conservative management, he suggested, restrictions could remain in place.",
      "Nonetheless, Panthin said he \"felt glad that what I had seen and fought all along was acknowledged and there was a tangible progress\".",
      "\"I hope this court's ruling will set a new standard for the understanding about basic human rights at the school.\""

      "Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study.",
      "Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York.",
      "A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.",
      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers.",
      "Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems.",
      "They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species.",
      "Southwest US most affected",
      "Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses.",
      "\"Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants,\" Prof Grames explained.",
      "The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection.",
      "Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery.",
      "\"Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "She also stressed the need for government action.",
      "\"Insects are fundamental to life on earth, and we need conservation actions and policies that support insects.\""

      "The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday.",

      "\"I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum\", he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. \"Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border.\"",
      "The comments were in stark contrast to the kind of language he has used for the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, who he continues to refer to as \"Governor Trudeau\", while calling Canada \"the 51st State\".",

      "It is testament to her diplomacy that Trump seems to genuinely appreciate her tone, clarity and overall demeanour in their interactions.",
      "She has refused to accept publicly that Mexico hasn't done enough on either of the main border issues on which Trump is demanding action from his neighbours: fentanyl trafficking and undocumented immigration north.",
      "She began Thursday's morning press briefing by referring to new figures from the US Customs and Border Protection agency which show seizures of fentanyl have dropped to 263 kilos, their lowest levels in 3 years. It represents a 75% drop in the last six months of her presidency.",
      "When tariffs were avoided in February, Sheinbaum agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border.",
      "Her administration has also extradited (although they prefer the word \"expelled\") 29 drug cartel figures to the US to face trial on charges from murder to money laundering, including a top drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been wanted by the US authorities since the mid-1980s.",
      "Those may well have been the measures Trump was referring to when he said the two countries were \"working hard, together\" on border security.",
      "Furthermore, she has often thrown the ball back in the US president's direction.",
      "Where do the guns which arm the cartels come from, she asks rhetorically, openly calling for the US to do more to curb the flow of weapons south and tackle its demand for illegal drugs. The drugs may come from Latin America, she points out, but the market for their consumption is overwhelmingly in the US.",
      "Even when the Trump administration recently designated six Mexican cartels as \"foreign terrorist organisations\", it seemed to strengthen her hand.",
      "That's because her administration is currently embroiled in a legal battle with US gun manufacturers over negligence. If US weapons-makers have allowed their products to reach terrorists rather than mere criminals, Mexico could expand its lawsuit, she said, to include a new charge of \"complicity\" with terror groups.",
      "And yet while President Sheinbaum is enjoying a strong start to her presidency \u2013 both domestically and in the eyes of the world \u2013 for her handling of Trump, it is worth stressing that these are early days in their bilateral relationship.",
      "\"I think she has played the hand she has been dealt pretty well\", said Mexican economist, Valeria Moy. \"I'm not sure it's time for celebration just yet. But I think she has done what she can in the face of the threat of tariffs. It makes little sense for either of side to enter into a trade war.\"",
      "The key to Sheinbaum's success seems to have been in refusing to back down on unreasonable requests or matters of real importance, while similarly not appearing subservient or acquiescent to the White House's demands.",
      "That is not an easy path to tread.",
      "On some questions \u2013 the Gulf of Mexico being renamed by Trump as the Gulf of America, for example \u2013 she can afford to remain above the fray knowing that most people around the world are unlikely to adopt his preferred terminology.",
      "On others, particularly tariffs, the stakes are considerably higher; there's a danger that the constant back-and-forth and instability on the issue could push the Mexican economy into recession.",
      "The Mexican peso weakened again during this latest episode and, although Sheinbaum claims the country's economy is strong, the markets would clearly prefer a more reliable and solid relationship with the US. Mexico remains the US's biggest trading partner, after all.",
      "When I spoke to President Sheinbaum on the campaign trail last year, shortly before she made history by becoming Mexico's first woman president, she said she would have no problem working with a second Trump presidency and that she would always \"defend\" what was right for Mexicans \u2013 including the millions who reside in the US.",
      "\"We must always defend our country and our sovereignty,\" she told me.",
      "With so much bluster between these three neighbours in recent days, it is easy to forget that the Trump presidency is still only six weeks old.",
      "The new relationship with the White House has a long way to go, with the USMCA trade agreement to be renegotiated next year. But certainly, amid all the political theatre, Claudia Sheinbaum will be more pleased than Justin Trudeau with how it has started.",

      "Set in rural Maharashtra state, the film centres around Savita, a young woman striving for an education and a career in a patriarchal society, and the attempts by her father Daulatrao Wandhare - a poor cotton farmer - to find a good husband for his daughter.",
      "\"He wants a good price for his crop and a good match for his daughter,\" says director Jayant Digambar Somalkar.",
      "The film is notable for the unflinching way it portrays what its lead actress calls the \"very humiliating\" experience of many young women, unlike other Indian movies about arranged marriage.",
      "Sthal has also grabbed attention as its entire cast is made up of first-time actors chosen from the village where it is shot. Nandini Chikte, who plays Savita, has already won two awards for her brilliant performance.",
      "The film opens with a sequence where Savita is interviewing a prospective groom.",
      "Along with her female relatives and friends, she watches as the young man serves them drinks from a tray. They laugh when he, visibly nervous, fumbles during questioning.",
      "Rudely awakened from what turned out to be a dream, Savita is told to get ready as a group of men are coming to see her.",
      "In reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus.",
      "The prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in.",
      "Dressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators.",

      "They leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision.",
      "According to her parents, \"this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita\" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair.",
      "The scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides.",
      "Savita's protestations - \"I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career\" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman.",

      "Though it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings.",
      "Parents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries.",

      "Director Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience.",
      "Growing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home.",
      "\"As a child you don't question tradition,\" he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride.",
      "\"This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 01:20:36 GMT",
    "summary": "As she returns to pop with her seventh album, Mayhem, Lady Gaga reflects on the loneliness of fame.",
    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",
      "\"I stepped away from the icon. It ends with love.\"",

      "\"I discovered writing this book, it was very clear that I'm not good with grief. I'm not good with loss at all,\" she said. \"I still find it painful. I can't even listen to a Beastie Boys song. It feels like a death to me.\"",

      "\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said.",

      "\"I was in the shower, pregnant and sobbing because it was so stressful. And then I thought my mother probably was pregnant with me in a shower in 1969,\" she said. \"That's a very direct repeat of a pattern.\"",

      "Reflecting on completing her memoir, Skye called it \"an act of self-forgiveness.\"",

      "\"Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy,\" Parton said in a statement. Dean was 82 years old.",

      "The couple met in 1964, when they ran into each other outside the Wishy Washy Laundromat on the first day Parton had moved to Nashville. He swept her off her feet, as\u00a0Parton later described it, and the couple married two years later.",

And I don't regret it. I never regretted it. I mean, it was a choice. So, you make your choices, you make your sacrifices, and I never looked back.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-hollywood-has-changed-filmmaking-in-the-age-of-streaming/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:05:52 -0500",
    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",
      "As of mid-2024, U.S. residents owed at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to data from the American Hospital Association. Health care bills have for years been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies.",
      "\"We need reforms to find savings that can trickle down to the individual, so that these circumstances \u2014 of making what should be unnecessary tradeoffs \u2014 aren't the condition moving forward,\" Lash added.",

      "The top communications official under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly resigned last week, just two weeks after being sworn in to be the department's assistant secretary for public affairs.",
      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon did not comment, when asked about Kennedy's remarks. Instead, Nixon re-sent a previous statement attributed to principal deputy chief of staff Stefanie Spear about Kennedy making measles a \"top priority\" for his team.",
      "Spear is one of a handful of aides now at HHS to have worked for Kennedy during his longshot presidential campaign. Many others were hired from the ranks of Trump supporters and alumni of other federal agencies.",
      "This includes Nixon, who previously handled press for Trump's campaign. Nixon had reported to Corry alongside Michael Brady, a former top Army public affairs official.",

      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",

      "Walgreens said Thursday that Sycamore will pay $11.45 per share, giving the deal an equity value just under $10 billion. Shareholders could eventually receive up to another $3 per share under certain conditions.",
      "A buyout to take the drugstore chain private would give it more flexibility to make changes to improve its business without worrying about Wall Street's reaction. The company has already been making some big changes as it seeks to turn around its business. Walgreens has been a public company since 1927.",
      "Walgreens, founded in 1901, has been dealing with thin prescription reimbursement, rising costs, persistent theft and inflation-sensitive shoppers who are looking for bargains elsewhere. Walgreens is in the early stages of a plan to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. locations.",
      "The Deerfield, Illinois, company had already shed about a thousand U.S. stores since it grew to nearly 9,500 after buying some Rite Aid locations in 2018.",

      "Shares of Walgreens shed nearly two thirds of their value last year. Walgreens said the transaction price represents a nearly 30% premium to the share price in December when reports of a deal first surfaced. Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth confirmed in January that a sale process for the business was underway. Including debt, the value of the deal is just under $24 billion, the company said.",
      "Walgreens said earlier this year it was making progress improving prescription reimbursement.",
      "Walgreens has also taken steps to preserve cash. It said in January that it was suspending a quarterly dividend it has offered for more than 90 years, and it's been reducing its stake in the drug distributor Cencora this year to get cash in part to pay down debt.",
      "Ultimately, the company has to improve its cash flow, whether it remains publicly traded or goes private, Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny said in a Feb. 23 research note.",
      "\"Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,\" the analyst wrote. \"Without cash flow, none of the value cases work.\"",
      "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. also runs nearly 3,700 international stores, with locations in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Thailand and Ireland.",
      "The Walgreens buyout comes after competitor Rite Aid emerged last September as a private company from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Remaining publicly traded drugstore operators include the nation's largest, CVS Health Corp., and retailers like Walmart and the grocer Kroger that run pharmacies at many of their locations.",

      "Employers cut 172,017 jobs last month, a 245% increase from January and double the number that was announced during the same month a year ago, the company said. That marks the highest monthly number of layoffs since July 2020, when 262,649 cuts were announced, the firm added.",
      "The job cuts were led by losses in federal jobs, largely directed by DOGE, which says it is dedicated to rooting out government waste and fraud. DOGE-related job losses have cut a wide swath across federal government agencies by targeting newly hired workers, regardless of their job performance or whether their jobs are essential.",
      "In a few cases, some agencies have scrambled to rehire workers who were fired under DOGE's policies, such as the U.S. Agriculture Department bringing back bird flu experts who were mistakenly cut.",
      "Federal agencies announced 62,242 job cuts last month, an increase of 41,311% from a year earlier, Challenger, Gray said. More federal cuts are on the way, with the Veterans Affairs Department planning to cut thousands of jobs in the coming months, while some government workers may opt to leave because of the uncertainty caused by the layoffs, the group said.",
      "\"When mass layoffs occur, it often leaves remaining staff feeling uneasy and uncertain. The likelihood that many more workers leave voluntarily is high,\" Andrew Challenger, workplace expert for Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",

The jobless rate is forecast to remain steady at 4%. Some analysts expect layoffs ordered by DOGE to show up in the report in the coming weeks or months.",
      "Other sectors besides the federal government also laid off workers last month, Challenger, Gray found. Retailers cut almost 39,000 jobs, while technology companies cut 14,554 jobs in February, its data shows.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",

    "summary": "Utah has become the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City \u2014 Utah on Wednesday became the first state to pass legislation requiring app stores to verify users' ages and get parental consent for minors to download apps to their devices.",
      "The bill headed to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox has pitted Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, against app store giants Apple and Google over who should be responsible for verifying ages. Similar bills have been introduced in at least eight other states in the latest fight over children's online safety. The proposals targeting app stores follow legal fights over laws requiring social media platforms to verify the ages of users.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don't do enough to make their products safe for children - or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "\"Parents want a one-stop shop to verify their child's age and grant permission for them to download apps in a privacy-preserving way. The app store is the best place for it,\" Meta, X and Snap Inc. said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We applaud Utah for putting parents in charge with its landmark legislation and urge Congress to follow suit.\"",
      "The app stores say app developers are better equipped to handle age verification and other safety measures. Requiring app stores to confirm ages will make it so all users have to hand over sensitive identifying information, such as a driver's license, passport, credit card or Social Security number, even if they don't want to use an age-restricted app, Apple said.",
      "\"Because many kids in the U.S. don't have government-issued IDs, parents in the U.S. will have to provide even more sensitive documentation just to allow their child to access apps meant for children. That's not in the interest of user safety or privacy,\" the company said in its most recent online safety report.",
      "Apple considers age a matter of privacy and lets users decide whether to disclose it. The company gives parents the option to set age-appropriate parameters for app downloads. The Google Play Store does the same.",
      "Apple and Google are among a litany of tech companies that help support the Chamber of Progress, a tech policy group that lobbied Utah lawmakers to reject the bill. Last year, Apple helped kill a similar bill in Louisiana that would have required app stores to help enforce age restrictions.",
      "Kouri Marshall, a spokesperson for the Chamber of Progress, called the measure \"a tremendous encroachment of individual privacy\" that he said places a heavy burden on app stores to ensure online safety.",
      "Republican Sen. Todd Weiler, the bill's sponsor, argued it's \"a lot easier to target two app stores than it is to target 10,000 (app) developers.\"",
      "Under the bill, app stores would be required to request age information when someone creates an account. If a minor tries to open one, the bill directs the app store to link it to their parent's account and may request a form of ID to confirm their identity. Weiler said a credit card could be used as an age verification tool in most cases.",
      "If a child tries to download an app that allows in-app purchases or requires them to agree to terms and conditions, the parent will first have to approve.",
      "Melissa McKay, a Utah mother, is among those who pushed for the legislation. She said she started asking questions about device safety after her nephew in 2017 was exposed to \"really harmful content on another student's device at school.\" Inaccurate age ratings on apps and faulty parental controls are \"at the root of online harm,\" McKay said.",
      "The eight other states considering proposals would similarly place responsibility on app stores to verify ages and seek parental permissions. A legislative committee advanced Alabama's bill last week.",
      "Lawsuits have delayed implementation of state laws regulating social media apps and websites. A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah's first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "If Cox signs the Utah bill into law, most provisions would take effect May 7. The governor's office didn't respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday. Cox, a Republican, supported the state law currently on hold that requires age verification on social media."

    "story": [
      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",
      "Shares of U.S. automakers jumped on Wednesday afternoon, with Ford Motor rising 47 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.58. GM shares gained about 7%, while Stellantis climbed 9.2%.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses large and small are bracing for the impact of the Trump administration's new tariffs on U.S. imports from\u00a0Mexico, Canada and China\u00a0\u2014 and preparing to pass on the pain to consumers.",
      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said this week that the electronics retailer is particularly exposed to the tariffs, noting that China and Mexico are the two largest suppliers of the company's products.",
      "\"[W]e expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,\" Barry said in a March 4 call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the company's latest financial results.",
      "The new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, plus a move to tack an additional 10% levy on to an existing 10% tariff on Chinese imports, took effect Tuesday. Those costs are borne largely by U.S. importers, usually leading to price hikes for shoppers.",
      "While Barry said the tariffs will lead to price increases, she didn't specify how big they would be.",
      "\"I think it is fair to say... that tariffs at this level will result in price increases. I think it is very difficult to say given the backdrop that we're in, exactly precisely how big that is,\" Barry added later in the call in response to a question from an analyst.",
      "A Walmart executive told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0in February that it would not be \"immune\" to the impact of such levies.",
      "And Target CEO Brian Cornell this week told CNBC that because the discount retailer relies heavily on produce from Mexico, consumers can expect to see higher prices on fruits and vegetables almost immediately.",
      "\"If there's a 25% tariff, those prices will go up,\" Cornell said.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0this week urged the Trump administration to reconsider the sweeping new tariffs, saying they force businesses to choose between hiking prices or risk going out of business.",
      "\"American families and businesses are struggling with high costs. It's one of the top issues that they want policymakers to address,\" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.",
      "\"We also want to work together to keep costs down, but tariffs will only raise prices and increase the economic pain being felt by everyday Americans across the country. We urge reconsideration of this policy and a swift end to these tariffs,\" he added.",
      "Franco Salerno, who owns Darianna Bridal and Tuxedo in Warrington, Pennsylvania, told the Chamber of Commerce the company is printing new price tags to reflect the increased costs dress designers expect to incur and pass along to Darianna's, due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Dress designers are already notifying us that they are raising prices to cover any tariffs,\" Salerno told the trade group.",
      "The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), a trade organization representing retailers, also called on President Trump to reconsider his tariff policy.",
      "\"The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hanson, RILA's senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. \"Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy. Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.\"",
      "Other businesses are also scrambling to budget for the impact of tariffs. David Spatafore, who owns several restaurants in San Diego, said soaring egg and dairy prices of late has taken a toll. Tuesday's tariffs are adding to the pain.",
      "\"Everything across the board is impacted,\" Spatafore said.",
      "One of his restaurants has also been remodeling, with the project getting increasingly expensive as tariffs hit Canadian lumber and steel.",

    "summary": "The stock market has swung wildly since President Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Here's what to know about your 401(k).",
    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",

China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",
      "A Canadian official confirmed to CBS News that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Canadian foreign minister M\u00e9lanie Joly intened to speak on Wednesday.",
      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",
      "The Mexican peso slumped against the U.S. dollar as Sheinbaum delivered her remarks on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg.",

      "More than 1.1 million people with public pensions \u2014 teachers, firefighters, police officers and the like \u2014 have recently received retroactive benefits due to the Social Security Fairness Act, the Social Security Administration said on Tuesday.",
      "The SSA said it is continuing to pay the retroactive benefits to eligible Social Security beneficiaries, whose monthly payments will increase beginning in April, reflecting March's benefit.",
      "The monthly benefit adjustment and retroactive payments are due to a law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, who said it would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "What is the average Social Security retroactive payment?",
      "The retroactive payments are due to the law's elimination of two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, the benefits hike is retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",

      "About 1.13 million people have received a combined $7.5 billion in retroactive payments through March 4, it added.",

      "The U.S. also imposed 10% tariffs on imports from China on top of those already in place, bringing them to 20%.",
      "The tariffs come as more U.S. households are showing signs of economic strain, with retailers such as Target and Walmart recently warning that inflation-weary consumers are cutting back on spending.

      "Canada had imposed some limited tariffs on U.S. products before 2025, and vice versa. Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which was signed by President Trump in 2020, the countries had negotiated a complex set of rules aimed at promoting trade.",

      "Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen is resigning following a probe into his personal conduct, the grocery chain\u00a0said Monday.",
      "McMullen, who was both the chairman and CEO, is out after a company board investigation found that his personal conduct, \"was inconsistent with Kroger's Policy on Business Ethics,\" the company said on Monday. His behavior was unrelated to business, Kroger added in the statement announcing his resignation.",
      "Ron Sargent, Kroger's lead director, will serve as the interim chairman of the board of directors and CEO, effective immediately, the company said.",
      "What did Rodney McMullen do?",
      "In its announcement, Kroger did not specify what McMullen did, only that his resignation stems from an investigation conducted by an independent counsel into certain behavior that the company's board became aware of on Feb. 21. The company then immediately hired an outside independent counsel to conduct an investigation, overseen by a special board committee",
      "\"Mr. McMullen's conduct is not related to the Company's financial performance, operations or reporting, and it did not involve any Kroger associates,\" Kroger said Monday.",
      "Kroger's board has formed a search committee to seek McMullen's replacement.",
      "\"As interim CEO, I am committed to working alongside our proven and experienced management team and dedicated associates to ensure Kroger continues providing exceptional value for our customers,\" Sargent, the interim CEO, said in a statement. \"Kroger has been a special place throughout my retail career after spending summers in college working in stores, as well as my first 10 years after business school at corporate headquarters, before more recently serving as lead independent director.\"",
      "Sargent has worked as a Kroger director since 2006, and has been in his role as lead director since 2017.",
      "Ousted CEO McMullen began his career at Kroger in 1978 as a part-time stock clerk, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was appointed CEO in 2014, and was named chairman of the board in 2015.",
      "Kroger shares were down about 1% on Monday.",
      "No major changes anticipated",
      "The executive shakeup comes after a failed $25 billion merger with rival Albertsons. Albertsons pulled the plug on the deal in December after a judge temporarily blocked the union.",
      "\"Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,\" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time. \"We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.\"",
      "Cincinnati, Ohio-based Kroger operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia, including the chains Harris Teeter, Mariano's, Ralphs and Smith's.",
      "Telsey Advisory Group analysts said that while the executive shake-up was surprise, they \"don't anticipate major operating changes given the stability of the business and capable new leaders\" and because \"the issue had nothing to do with operations or employees,\" they said in a research note.",
      "Kroger also recently announced a new CFO, David Kennerley, who will join the company on March 10.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-a-crypto-strategic-reserve-trump-bitcoin/",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",

      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",

      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling.

      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",

    "summary": "President Trump announced that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "summary": "A new study finds that long, unproductive meetings can lead to \"meeting hangovers,\" affecting workflow and productivity.",
    "story": [
      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

      "In a March 2 letter to Dudek, Warren highlights a LinkedIn post from before his appointment as acting commissioner, in which he wrote that he had \"bullied agency executives\" to help the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, billionaire Elon Musk's cost-cutting effort. Dudek added that he shared executive contact information and \"moved contractor money around\" to add resources to his anti-fraud team, according to Warren's letter.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The post, which has since been deleted from LinkedIn, suggests that Dudek may \"have acted against agency policy \u2014 or even illegally \u2014 to facilitate DOGE's efforts to access SSA systems,\" Warren wrote in the letter. Since being appointed as acting commissioner, Dudek has announced a significant restructuring of the agency, including cutting 7,000 jobs, or about 12% of its workforce, which current employees say could hamper\u00a0its mission to provide retirement and disability benefits to almost 70 million Americans.",
      "\"The circumstances of your appointment raise questions about the truthfulness of President Trump's assertion that 'Social Security will not be touched [by DOGE],'\" Warren wrote in the letter. DOGE has \"launched an attack on the agency, closing at least 10 local offices,\u00a0firing scores of personnel and gaining access to SSA internal systems.\"",
      "Warren added that SSA leaders \"were reportedly so concerned about your behavior that they placed you on administrative leave pending an investigation into your efforts on DOGE's behalf.\"",

    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",

      "Joseph Shea, who sells athletic wear in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, wonders and worries about the food he eats.",
      "The chemical ingredients with mystifying names. The references on product labels to unspecified natural or artificial flavors. The junk food that fits his budget but feels addictive and makes him feel unwell.",
      "Shea, one of 1,310 people who responded to a poll the health policy research group KFF conducted on health care priorities, said he assumes the FDA is making sure the ingredients are safe.",
      "In many cases, it is not.",
      "The FDA's restraints on food ingredients are limited and relatively feeble, especially compared with those in Europe, a KFF Health News examination found. There are at least 950 substances in our food that are not permitted in Europe, according to one expert's estimate, and chemicals linked to health concerns show up in hundreds of products that line the shelves of American supermarkets.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has railed about the risks of food additives for years and has said he wants to end \"the mass poisoning of American children.\" At a March 6 confirmation hearing, Martin Makary, President Trump's nominee to head the FDA, expressed concern about foods \"with a lot of molecules that do not appear in nature.\"",
      "\"These are chemicals that the industry insists are safe, a subset of which are concerning,\" he said.",
      "But the Trump administration's initial moves to reduce staff at the FDA led the director of its food safety unit, Jim Jones, to resign last month and raised fears among food safety specialists that the administration could weaken oversight.",
      "To a great extent, the FDA leaves it to food companies to determine whether their ingredients and additives are safe. Companies don't have to tell the FDA about those decisions, and they don't have to list all ingredients on their product labels.",
      "Though pharmaceutical companies are required to share research on humans with the FDA, the agency is largely blind to what food-makers know about their products.",
      "\"The food industry does massive amounts of research that we have no access to,\" Robert Califf told a Senate committee in December on his way out as FDA commissioner.",
      "As a result: The FDA's oversight of food additives is much weaker than its oversight of prescription drugs.",
      "\"There is good reason to be concerned about the chemicals that are routinely included in much of our food,\" Califf testified.",
      "Food is a big business. American consumers spend almost $1.7 trillion annually on food and beverages, according to Circana, a research and advisory firm.",
      "Yet American food companies keep secret much of what they put in their products.",
      "KFF Health News asked nine of the largest food manufacturers \u2014 The Coca-Cola Co., Conagra Brands, General Mills, Kellanova (successor to Kellogg), The Kraft Heinz Co., Mondel\u0113z International, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, and Unilever \u2014 for the number of ingredients, if any, that go unnamed on their product labels and the names of those ingredients deemed safe without involvement by the FDA, and substances used in their products in the United States but not in Europe, and vice versa.",
      "None provided answers to those questions.",
      "\"We focus on the quality of the ingredients that we use, and all comply with applicable regulatory requirements,\" Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Dana Stambaugh said.",
      "Chemicals such as titanium dioxide and potassium bromate, whose safety has been debated, are allowed in foods in the United States but not in Europe.",
      "Corporations may turn a blind eye to potential dangers, a July 2024 FDA-funded report warned.",
      "Potentially harmful ingredients \"are not necessarily required to be named on a product label,\" the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, an adjunct to the agency, said in the report, which was based largely on interviews with representatives of companies across the food supply chain.",
      "\"Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,\" the report said.",
      "Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as \"spices\" and \"artificial flavors,\" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.",
      "And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels \u2014 potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes \u2014 have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.",
      "Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are \"deliberately designed to be addictive,\" contributing to an epidemic of obesity \u2014 a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. \"And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,\" he said.",
      "The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as \"rigorous,\" \"evidence-based,\" and \"proven.\" The system enables companies \"to innovate to meet consumer demand,\" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.",
      "\"Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,\" Gallo added.",
      "More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States \u2014 and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.",
      "\"The system is fundamentally broken,\" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. \"It's so bad, nobody knows \u2014 not even FDA knows \u2014 what's in our food.\"",
      "Banned abroad",
      "The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.",
      "The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.\" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.",
      "The FDA allows potassium bromate\u00a0to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.",
      "Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a \"genotoxic carcinogen\" in 1992.",
      "On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.",
      "The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight \u2014 which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.",
      "Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.",
      "Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.",
      "A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.",
      "\"That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,\" Millstone said.",
      "\"Several decades behind Europeans\"",
      "When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them \u2014 even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.",
      "In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)",
      "In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.",
      "\"In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them,\" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. \"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.\"",
      "The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.",
      "Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as \"an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.",
      "FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS \"to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.\"",
      "\"The loophole swallowed the law\"",
      "The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.",
      "In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances \"generally recognized as safe,\" which came to be known simply as GRAS.",
      "As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder \u2014 along with many chemicals.",
      "Over time, \"the loophole swallowed the law,\" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.",
      "A better translation of GRAS would be \"Generally Recognized as SECRET,\" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.",
      "A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. \"GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.",
      "That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.",
      "For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says \"such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.\"",
      "About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.",
      "The scientists on the FEMA panel \"adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,\" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.",
      "Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.",
      "Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.",
      "\"Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,\" he added.",
      "Another way",
      "Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons \u2014 giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.",
      "If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.",
      "And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.",
      "FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.",
      "For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.",
      "But if companies market products as \"generally recognized as safe\" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.",
      "Psyched out",
      "On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.",
      "An \"independent review panel of scientific experts\" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was \"Generally Recognized As Safe,\" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.",
      "The company described the panel's judgment as a successful \"certification\" and \"a key milestone.\" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said \"has incredible healing and medicinal powers.\" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained \"self-Gras status.\"",
      "In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.",
      "However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.",
      "In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.",
      "Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known \"pharmacologically active constituents,\" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have \"potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\"",
      "The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's \"Diamond Shruumz\" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.",
      "The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.",
      "The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.",
      "The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.",
      "As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will \"continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.\"",
      "\"Probably poisoning us\"",
      "If food ingredients cause acute reactions \u2014 sending people to emergency rooms, for example \u2014 the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.",
      "Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.",
      "All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.",
      "For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.",
      "Shea said the entire picture is \"incredibly frustrating.\"",
      "\"They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says he's suspending security clearances of lawyers at Perkins Coie, which was involved in launching oppo research during the 2016 campaign into any ties between Trump and Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday he was moving to suspend the security clearances of attorneys at Perkins Coie, a law firm linked to Democratic-funded opposition research during the 2016 presidential campaign into any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia.",
      "The sanction against Perkins Coie is the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Trump and his administration to target a broad cross-section of perceived adversaries, including Justice Department prosecutors, career intelligence officials and, most recently, private-practice attorneys.",
      "\"This is an absolute honor to sign. What they've done is just terrible. It's weaponization \u2014 you could say weaponization against a political opponent, and it should never be allowed to happen again,\" Mr. Trump said as he prepared to sign the executive order in the Oval Office.",
      "The order directs the attorney general, the director of national intelligence and other relevant agency heads to \"take steps consistent with applicable law to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Perkins Coie, pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\" It does not specify how many lawyers at the law firm would be subject to losing their clearances.",
      "It also instructs agency heads to restrict access to government buildings by attorneys at the firm \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States\" and to identify, and cancel, contracts they have with the firm.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the firm said, \"We have reviewed the Executive Order. It is patently unlawful, and we intend to challenge it.\"",
      "The punishment arises from the hiring by Perkins Coie of Fusion GPS, a research and intelligence firm, to conduct opposition research on then-candidate Trump's potential ties to Russia. The arrangement was brokered by Marc Elias, who at the time was a well-connected partner at Perkins Coie and top lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, but who has since left the firm and started his own practice.",
      "Fusion GPS in return retained former British spy Christopher Steele, whose dossier of research circulated among journalists and government officials in Washington during the campaign. The dossier, which was turned over to the FBI for its review, contended that Russia was engaged in a longstanding effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about him.",
      "But the material has since been largely discredited as containing salacious and unverified rumors linking Trump to Russia, with special counsel John Durham's 2023 report on the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation saying that FBI investigators who tried to corroborate Steele's findings were unable to verify a \"single substantive allegation.\" Steele has stood by his work.",
      "The dossier created a political firestorm in January 2017, when it was revealed that then-FBI Director James Comey had briefed Trump before he took office on the existence of allegations from the research. The subsequent revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee had helped fund the dossier added to questions about the legitimacy of Steele's research, which Trump as president repeatedly attacked as \"phony\" and inaccurate.",
      "Trump and his allies have long tried to use the dossier's flaws to undermine the entire investigation into connections between his 2016 campaign and Russia. But the investigation began weeks before the FBI agents who were working on it came into possession of dossier and was opened based on an entirely different tip \u2014 that a Trump campaign aide claimed to have knowledge that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump's opponent, well before Russia was known to have hacked Democratic emails.",
      "And though special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not conclude that Russia and the Trump campaign had criminally conspired to tip the election, it did identify a sweeping effort by the Kremlin to intervene on the Republican candidate's behalf, as well as evidence that the campaign welcomed the help.",
      "Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired Justice Department prosecutors who participated in special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump. It also said it was stripping security clearances of lawyers who provided legal services for Smith and of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed onto a 2020 letter asserting that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The Perkins Coie executive order also alleges that the firm engages in what the Trump administration describes as unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "That follows a directive from Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that calls on the Justice Department's civil rights division to \"investigate, eliminate and penalize illegal\" DEI \"preferences, mandates, policies, programs and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\"",

    "story": [
      "Houston, Texas \u2014 The Trump administration is reviving the controversial practice of detaining migrant families with children in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, the latest front in its effort to carry out a deportation effort the president has promised will be the largest in U.S. history.",
      "ICE on Thursday was detaining the first group of migrant parents and children in a detention facility in Texas designed to hold families with minors, according to an internal government report obtained by CBS News. The group includes three children, the report shows.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the migrants have deportation orders and confirmed the Trump administration is refitting two Texas immigration detention centers to hold families who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"We aren't going to ignore the rule of law,\" McLaughlin told CBS News.",
      "The Karnes detention facility is located in Karnes City, Texas, a small town east of San Antonio. The other ICE detention center equipped to house families with minor children is located in Dilley, Texas, another small town south of San Antonio. The Biden administration used those sites to detain migrant adults.",
      "The move by the Trump administration reverses a policy change by the Biden administration, which discontinued the long-term detention of migrant families. It's a practice that was first implemented on a large-scale by the Obama administration, in an attempt to discourage families from crossing the southern border illegally.",
      "Advocates and child welfare experts have long denounced family detention, saying it is harmful to children and their psychological well-being. A 2016 report commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security called for family immigration detention to be phased out.",
      "\"There is no safe way to detain families and no legitimate justification for this inhumane practice,\" said Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center of Youth Law representing migrant children in a federal court case.",
      "The U.S. government has long faced legal, humanitarian and operational challenges when processing migrant parents and children who are in the country without legal permission. In 2015, for example, a federal judge ruled that the government should generally not hold migrant children for longer than 20 days, dramatically limiting family detention in the immigration context.",

    "story": [
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, says Ukrainians brought the pause in U.S. intelligence sharing \"on themselves.\"",
      "It's \"sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said of the impact of the intelligence pause on the battlefield. \"Got their attention.\"",
      "The intelligence the U.S. has been sharing has been critical in helping Ukraine strike Russian military targets, as well as anticipate and block Russian attacks.",
      "\"But it's a pause. It's not an end,\" Kellogg told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan in an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations Thursday. \"But it's sort of of like, okay, we're trying to get your attention.\"",
      "\"That's a pretty major concession to Russia, to constrain Ukraine's ability to target and hit Russian forces,\" Brennan said, pointing out, \"this pressure really seems to be directly impacting, potentially, what they can do on the battlefield.\"",
      "\"Very candidly, they brought it on themselves,\" Kellogg responded, to hisses from the audience.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe acknowledged the intelligence sharing pause Wednesday, a move that followed the contentious White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Friday. The meeting with President Trump was supposed to culminate in the signing of a rare earth minerals deal but instead ended in recrimination, as Zelenskyy sought to remind the president and Vice President JD Vance of the treaties Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken in the past, while Mr. Trump and Vance berated the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office, accusing him of not saying \"thank you\" for U.S. military aid.",
      "Though Kellogg indicated that intelligence sharing could resume, he declined to say when. \"That's up to the president of the United States,\" he told Brennan.",
      "Kellogg also said the Trump administration would be willing to work with Zelenskyy once the minerals agreement is finalized.",
      "\"Sign a document, and then once you sign the document that you want to go forward, that you're serious about it, then I think you can move forward,\" said Kellogg. \"When I was in Kyiv two weeks ago, I was very clear to President Zelenskyy \u2014 the outcome if we didn't have a signed agreement.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now likely to be the administration official who signs the deal with Ukraine. And next week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff expects to meet with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he told reporters Thursday.",
      "Witkoff met with Putin for about three and a half hours last month in Russia and returned to the U.S. with \"an indication of where the Russians are\" on peace negotiations, Kellogg said.",
      "\"We want to do the same thing with the Ukrainians, as well,\" Kellogg told Brennan.",
      "Notably, Kellogg denied an earlier statement by Witkoff that the Istanbul protocol, drafted shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, could serve as the basis for a peace deal framework between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "The right-leaning Institute for the Study of War describes the Istanbul protocol as \"entirely incompatible with the current stated U.S. policy\" and argues it \"cannot be the basis or guidepost for negotiations that amount to anything other than capitulation to Russia's pre-war demands.\"",
      "The institute noted that a draft of that agreement would have had Ukraine surrender its sovereignty and would have prevented it from maintaining armed forces sufficient to deter a Russian attack.",
      "\"Steve said it's a departure point. I think that's a good word to use,\" said Kellogg. \"I don't believe for all of us that that is an equitable framework. And I think we have to develop something entirely new,\" he continued.",
      "\"I think Steve made a comment as a general comment, and it is not the Trump administration policy\u00a0 because they haven't made their policy,\" he added.",
      "At this point, Kellogg estimates that the Ukrainians should have enough military aid to continue fighting through the summer.",
      "\"They have an ability with the assets they've got to continue to prosecute the fight, to do it,\" said Kellogg.",
      "Kellogg would not confirm that as part of a peace agreement the U.S. would backstop any European peacekeeping forces by providing security guarantees to Ukraine.",
      "\"That's part of the discussion we're having with the Europeans as well \u2014 when you talk what does [a] backstop look like,\" said Kellogg.",
      "\"What does that look like on the economic side, what do sanctions look like, what do frozen assets, whatever it's going to be? And then we also look at the military side as well,\" he said.",
      "Beyond bringing the conflict to a close, Kellogg also said president seeks a \"reset\" of U.S. relations with Russia.",
      "\"The need to reset relations with Russia to secure Americans' vital national interest, and ultimately, to stop U.S. entanglement in an endless proxy war, are the driving reasons why President Trump's approach and the framing of this war is distinct from the broader, conventional approach that we see publicly to the war,\" said Kellogg.",
      "He acknowledged, however, that existing sanctions against Russia need to be enforced more aggressively to be more effective.",
      "If you ranked U.S. sanctions against Russia on a scale of 1 to 7, he said, \"the problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a 3.\"",

The U.S. military's European Command has also said shipments of arms that were already on their way \u2014 approved by the Biden administration but not yet delivered \u2014 have been paused.",
      "The pause is part of President Trump's abrupt shift in policy on Ukraine, which has seen the White House adopt rhetoric closely aligned with Russia's narrative justifying the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. Trump's bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire deal that could involve significant concessions by Kyiv.",
      "Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington moderated by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House's determination to forge a peace deal.",

      "Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential",
      "Zelenskyy's reluctance to sign an economic deal thus far, without clear guarantees that it would come with a commitment from the U.S. to help defend Ukraine from further Russian attack, appeared to enrage Mr. Trump during their\u00a0chaotic Oval Office meeting on Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr. Trump has said himself that he trusts Russia to keep any promises it makes.",
      "Ukraine and America's European allies do not trust Putin's Russia. They note that as the Biden administration warned of Russia's looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions.",
      "\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war. \u2026 We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said about a month before Putin ordered the full-scale invasion, sparking the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II.",
      "Given that recent history, Ukraine's former Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News on Wednesday that any talk of a ceasefire with Russia now, without clear security guarantees from the West, would only give Putin time to regroup and rearm his strained military, and then to reinvade.",
      "Could a Ukrainian \"goodwill gesture\" get Trump on board?",
      "\"We are interested in peace, but we are definitely interested in something that would be guaranteed as a peace, and that would not be used by the Russian Federation as a pause to remobilize and to attack with a tsunami wave over Ukraine and also over European countries,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News in Kyiv on Wednesday.",

      "\"I think the only thing that that deal is potentially going to give us is a discussion on another deal,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, suggesting the economic agreement could serve as a framework, \"and the possibility to engage the United States. \u2026 It's a goodwill gesture with hope that it would translate into the U.S. standing with good against the evil.\"",
      "Russia, Europeans stress, has shown no willingness so far to bend on any of its maximalist demands that Ukraine cede the roughly 20% of its territory currently occupied by Putin's forces. The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to any European peacekeeping forces helping maintain a truce.",
      "Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue",
      "Far from any signs of d\u00e9tente, Russian missiles, bombs and explosive drones have continued falling on Ukraine.",
      "Overnight, the attacks intensified. The eastern city of Krivy Rih, President Zelenskyy's hometown, was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. In a post on social media,\u00a0Zelenskyy said among the damaged buildings was a hotel full of aid workers, including some U.S. and British volunteers. At least 30 people were injured in the attack and four killed, Zelenskyy said, adding that none of those killed were from the U.S. or U.K.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness of the Russian Federation to really engage,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, noting that \"every single night\" Ukraine has faced Russian bombardment. \"That is not something that is showing goodwill of terminating these attacks.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants, what Russia wants",
      "Klympush-Tsintsadze said she hoped an agreement with the Trump administration on minerals \"would give us the possibility, hopefully, to come to a real peace settlement,\" but she cautioned that \"a peace settlement that would not have security provisions on the side of our partners would barely hold with the Russian Federation.\"",
      "\"We've been there before,\" she said, stressing that when Russia first attacked her country 11 years ago, sending in forces to seize the Crimean Peninsula while denying their presence, Moscow claimed it was because \"NATO is expanding,\" but she said at the time Ukraine was \"a totally neutral and non-aligned, non-block country.\"",
      "\"And then all the other lies that the Russian Federation has been coming up with against the Ukrainian people, just because they don't want us to exist. They just want to exterminate us as a nation and as a country, and that's their goal. So, in order for us to reach peace, we would have to see the way to that peace settlement \u2014 which definitely comes through a ceasefire, but not necessarily ends with a ceasefire.\"",
      "Moscow has defended its aggression against Ukraine for more than a decade as a justified reaction to the U.S.-led NATO alliance's territory inching toward Russia's western border. That expansion began in the wake of the communist Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, with former Soviet bloc republics choosing to join the Western alliance to ensure their own security.",
      "Ukraine has expressed interest in joining the NATO alliance for over 20 years, and it has cooperated with NATO as a neutral partner for about that long, but it was not given a clear\u00a0path to membership \u2014 largely due to many members worrying it would be seen as a provocation by Russia \u2014 until after Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In 2023, with the war well underway, then-President Biden said he didn't believe Ukraine was \"ready for membership in NATO,\" adding that he didn't see unanimity among the alliance's members \"about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\"",
      "President Trump's administration has\u00a0ruled out Ukraine joining the alliance and launched unilateral negotiations with Russia. That direct Washington-Moscow dialogue and the lack of any clear demands by Mr. Trump for concessions from Putin have stoked fears in Kyiv and Western European capitals about the White House's commitment to both the NATO alliance and to securing a ceasefire in Ukraine that looks like anything other than humiliation and capitulation for pro-Western Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia insists it wants to end the war it started in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump has said he believes Moscow on that point. Speaking Thursday to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on the Russian narrative, pushed since Mr. Trump engaged in talks with Putin, that Europe, to a greater degree than Washington, is to blame for the conflict's enduring nature.",
      "Peskov said that while the U.S. under Mr. Trump \"is not a friendly country to us at the moment, the United States is a country with which we are now trying to revive and restore our bilateral relations.\"",
      "That is not the case, he made clear, of America's NATO allies in Europe.",
      "Ukraine seeks Europe's support, but hopes the \"United States will stand for democracy\"",
      "Peskov cited remarks by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who called Wednesday for Europe to boost its collective military capabilities and assume more responsibility for the continent's defense \u2014 as President Trump has demanded \u2014 as evidence that \"France is really looking for a continuation of the war.\" He said Macron had suggested that \"France is ready to use its nuclear weapons for security purposes and so on,\" claiming the French leader had issued \"a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe, that is, it is very, very confrontational.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called Macron's remarks \"a threat to Russia,\" while dismissing European suggestions that it is in fact Russia which poses a threat to security on the continent, calling that \"stupid\" and \"delirious nonsense.\"",
      "Macron did reference atomic weapons in his Wednesday night address, saying France's \"deterrent capabilities\" had helped to protect the country \"much more than many of our neighbors\" who do not possess such weapons. He did not mention plans to bolster France's nuclear deterrent specifically, but said that as the Trump administration signals less willingness to come to its European allies' defense, he would consider requests from nations such as Germany to extend \"the protection of our allies on the European continent by our deterrent.\"",
      "As Europe grapples over how to ensure its own defense from future Russian or other threats, Ukrainians will be hoping the continent's leaders move quickly to boost their own defenses against Russia's current, ongoing assault.",
      "France was quick to confirm it would continue sharing its intelligence with Ukraine after the U.S. cutoff, with Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu saying: \"Our intelligence is sovereign. We have intelligence that we allow Ukraine to benefit from.\"",
      "\"We are hoping that all the great... warm political will of the European nations will also, as urgently as possible, will translate in upscaling their defense engagement with Ukraine,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News. \"They've given a lot. They have much more limited capacities than the United States, but we hope that they will be able to invest in Ukrainian defense capacities, that they will be able to upscale their defense production, that they will help us also to procure weaponry in order for us to stay strong while Russia has not given up on their plans to just destroy us.\"",
      "She made it clear that Ukraine would also continue working toward an agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We are to try to get the message across to the American public. I think that this is also very important, and I'm sure that President Trump really cares about the support that he enjoys back in the United States, and I hope that he hears also his citizens [saying] why this is important, and why it is expected that the United States will stand for democracy, will stand for freedoms.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday said he is pausing 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",
      "Some of the most prominent retail executives in the U.S. have spoken out about the tariffs, saying they'd almost certainly lead to increased costs, some of which will be passed along to American consumers.",
      "Paulina Smolinski and \n                                                  \n                      Sara Cook\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "\"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me,\" said Mary Comans, who was FEMA's chief financial officer.",
    "story": [
      "A former government official who says she was falsely accused of illegally sending funds to New York City to book luxury hotels for undocumented migrants \u2014 and then publicly ridiculed and fired \u2014 said Thursday that just days earlier she had been directed by a member of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to make the payments.",
      "Mary Comans, who was the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, sued the agency and the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, on Tuesday.",
      "\"I was fired illegally by the Trump administration for doing my job, for doing exactly what I was directed to do by the Trump political appointees at the Department of Homeland Security and at the DOGE,\" she told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson did not respond for comment, nor did Brad Smith, the DOGE official Comans says she interacted with.",
      "The lawsuit argues she was \"unlawfully terminated\" from her position \"without cause or the due process required by law and the Constitution.\" As chief financial officer, Comans was a member of the \"senior executive service,\" the highest-level civil servant.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that DHS and FEMA publicly disclosed information about her",
      "termination that was protected under the Privacy Act and that she was defamed by the false portrayal about her conduct. At the time of her dismissal, Comans says the agency suggested falsely in a press release that she was a \"deep state activist.\"",
      "Comans joined DHS in 2004, inspired to serve in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. She called herself \"apolitical,\" noting that she served both Republican and Democratic administrations, often deploying to the scenes of natural disasters to help manage the federal government's response.",
      "\"My job is to serve the administration that was elected by the American people,\" she said.",
      "She had served as FEMA's chief financial officer since 2017 before she was abruptly fired on Feb. 11.",
      "During President Trump's first days back in office, Comans said the executive leadership team at FEMA was fielding executive orders as quickly as the president could sign them and \"were implementing them to the letter that he expected.\"",
      "One of the orders Comans carried out required DHS, and by extension FEMA, to freeze money going to nongovernmental organizations that provide services to undocumented immigrants. Payments that continued came from a $650 million Customs and Border Protection program created by Congress to reimburse cities for housing and sheltering migrants that had entered into the country illegally and were awaiting court proceedings. FEMA administered payments issued by the immigration program, but those funds were separate from the billions of dollars the agency spends on disaster relief.",
      "On Feb. 5, Comans says she and her team met with Smith, one of Elon Musk's top lieutenants, who was overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency's work at DHS. According to Comans, Smith instructed them to keep the funds from the CBP program flowing.",
      "Comans said it was \"very clear\" from the conversation with Smith \"that FEMA was doing the right thing in continuing\" the payments.",
      "\"We also received written guidance from the acting general counsel at FEMA that payments to state and locals needed to continue under the normal course of business,\" she said.",
      "Despite those assurances from Smith, on Feb. 10, Musk posted on X that DOGE \"just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President's executive order.\"",
      "Later that day, when she arrived at work, Comans says she met with her boss, acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton. She says Hamilton was also surprised by Musk's tweet and told her she had done nothing wrong. Comans then drafted a report, which CBS News reviewed, that documented her conversations with DOGE.",
      "\"I told him I was going to put together an after-action report detailing each of the conversations, the dates, the actions that FEMA took to show that we were operating within the guidelines provided to use by the Trump administration,\" Comans said. \"He thanked me, hugged me and again reassured me that nobody at FEMA would be fired for making these payments.\"",
      "Comans said she had another conversation with Hamilton that night to tell him that the funds had been recouped.",
      "\"I shared with him that I had successfully reversed the payment and the funds were being returned to Treasury as we speak,\" she said.",
      "The next morning, on Feb. 11, Comans says a colleague walked into Coman's office to tell her that she had been terminated effective immediately.",
      "\"Unfortunately, my colleague had no answers to provide me,\" Comans said.",
      "Her name went viral later that morning after conservative broadcaster Benny Johnson posted on X that Comans was \"fired for illegally funding migrant luxury hotels in NYC against the orders of President Trump.\" The post was spread by other rightwing accounts.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security sent out its press release about the firings shortly after that.",
      "\"Effective immediately, FEMA is terminating the employment of four individuals for circumventing leadership to unilaterally make egregious payments for luxury NYC hotels for migrants. Firings include FEMA's Chief Financial Officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist,\" the release said. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS will not sit idly and allow deep state activists to undermine the will and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Musk also shared a post about Comans, writing that her behavior was \"criminal.\"",
      "Comans said she feels betrayed by the department and agency because \"they have allowed Mr. Musk and others to slander my name, to defame me.\"",
      "\"The department has sat by idly and in some ways they have joined that choir of saying untrue statements about me,\" she said.",
      "Comans wants her name cleared and to be compensated for the damage she says has been caused. She would also take her job back if given the opportunity.",
      "\"I don't know that you can put a price on it,\" she said. \"To me, the No. 1 goal is clearing my name.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hampton Dellinger, the former head of the office that investigates whistleblower retaliation, has dropped his legal challenge to his firing by President Trump from his role as special counsel.",
      "Dellinger's decision to end his legal fight comes hours after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cleared the way for Mr. Trump to terminate him as leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "The D.C. Circuit granted a request from the president to halt a lower court order that blocked Dellinger's firing. The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, sided with the former special counsel in his challenge to his removal and said in a ruling Saturday that he must remain in the role.",
      "Dellinger's decision to walk away from the case cuts off its path to the Supreme Court, which has in a pair of recent decisions reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will.",
      "In a letter\u00a0filed Thursday, lawyers for Dellinger told the D.C. Circuit Court that he decided to no longer pursue judicial relief. They said they are still in talks with the federal government over the next steps to bring the litigation to a close, but wrote \"Dellinger's final and public decision means that there is presently no live appeal for this court to address.\"",
      "\"I'm stopping the fight because, yesterday, circuit court judges reviewing the trial court decision in my favor granted the government's request that I be removed from office while the case continues,\" Dellinger wrote in a statement obtained by CBS News. \"This new ruling means that OSC will be run by someone totally beholden to the president for the months that would pass before I could get a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "The ethics watchdog warned that the harm to those dependent on the agency under a future special counsel sympathetic to the Trump administration \"could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.\"",
      "\"I think the circuit judges erred badly because their willingness to sign off on my ouster \u2014 even if presented as possibly temporary \u2014 immediately erases the independence Congress provided for my position, a vital protection that has been accepted as lawful for nearly fifty years. Until now,\" Dellinger said. \"And given the circuit court's adverse ruling, I think my odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.\"",
      "Dellinger continued to take numerous actions under the scope of his former role while the legal battle over his firing played out. He petitioned against the Trump administration's recent mass firings of federal workers\u00a0and, on Tuesday, argued to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative system for federal workers to appeal employment issues, that the Department of Agriculture's firing of over 5,000 probationary workers violated civil service protections.",
      "Dellinger was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in February 2024 to a five-year term. But on Feb. 7, he received an email from the head of the White House's Presidential Personnel Office informing him that \"your position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "Dellinger swiftly challenged his firing in federal district court, alleging that it was unlawful because federal law restricts his removal by the president only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "Soon after, Jackson ordered Dellinger to be reinstated as special counsel while she considered his request for longer relief.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit and then the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute during the earlier stages and greenlight the president's firing of Dellinger. But last month, the high court declined to immediately step into the fight and instead put off a decision while the proceedings before the district court moved forward.",

      "The Justice Department again sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit, which granted its request to halt the district court's ruling while it considered the appeal.",
      "\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the unsigned order from the three-judge panel said.",
      "Dellinger's firing came as part of the president's efforts to overhaul the federal government and reduce its size and spending. Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has removed the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, and fired more than a dozen agency watchdogs, actions that have sparked legal challenges.",
      "A different federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, to be reinstated earlier this month. The Justice Department has appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit. Another district judge on Thursday ruled Mr. Trump's firing of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox   was unlawful.",
      "Thousands of federal workers deemed probationary have been laid off after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., declined to stop the firings, and the White House personnel and budget offices have told agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "A federal judge in California last month\u00a0found that the mass terminations are likely illegal in a separate case brought by labor unions and nonprofit organizations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Washington ruled Thursday that President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board was unlawful and said she must be allowed to continue in her role.",
      "In a 36-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, said that the Constitution and past decisions make clear that Congress can limit the president's removal power. She ruled that the president's firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB violated federal law that allows for a board member to be removed only for \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and declared her termination void.",
      "\"Under our constitutional system, such checks, by design, guard against executive overreach and the risk such overreach would pose of autocracy,\" Howell wrote in a 36-page decision. \"An American president is not a king \u2014 not even an 'elected' one \u2014 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here.\"",
      "Howell, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote that Mr. Trump \"seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme.\"",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "But soon after returning to a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump replaced Wilcox as chair and fired her from her position on the board in late January. While the National Labor Relations Act requires the president to remove a member \"upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" the email sent to Wilcox on behalf of the president stated that she and another board member have not \"been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of my administration.\"",
      "Wilcox told CBS News last month that she was \"stunned\" when she received a letter from the White House firing her.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, said. She swiftly challenged her firing in federal court.",
      "In her decision, the judge noted that in the 90 years since the NLRB was founded, the president has never removed a member of its board.",
      "\"His attempt to do so here is blatantly illegal, and his constitutional arguments to excuse this illegal act are contrary to Supreme Court precedent and over a century of practice,\" she said.",
      "The court found that a Supreme Court decision from 1935 binds the outcome of Wilcox's case. That case carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. The Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "\"The 150-year history and tradition of multimember boards or commissions and 90-year precedent from the Supreme Court approving of removal protections for their officers dictates the same outcome for the NLRB here,\" Howell wrote.",
      "She added that \"nothing in the Constitution or the historical development of the removal power has suggested the president's removal power is absolute.\"",
      "\"The president does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,\" the judge found.",
      "Howell criticized Mr. Trump for portraying himself as a king \u2014 pointing to a social media post from the White House last month that featured an illustration of the president wearing a crown, along with the headline \"long live the king\" \u2014 and said that he misunderstands the role of Article II of the Constitution, which lays out the scope of the president's powers.",
      "\"At issue in this case, is the president's insistence that he has authority to fire whomever he wants within the Executive branch, overriding any congressionally mandated law in his way,\" she wrote. \"Luckily, the Framers, anticipating such a power grab, vested in Article III, not Article II, the power to interpret the law, including resolving conflicts about congressional checks on presidential authority. The president's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power \u2014 or, more aptly, his aspiration \u2014 is flat wrong.\"",
      "The decision from Howell sets the case on a path to the Supreme Court and could lead it to overturn the 1935 decision in the case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. Sarah Harris, the acting solicitor general, wrote in a letter to Congress last month that the Trump administration believes that certain for-cause removal restrictions for multi-member commissions are unconstitutional and would urge the Supreme Court to overturn its precedent.",
      "The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years chipped away at that 90-year-old ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the\u00a0Supreme Court ruled\u00a0that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance was unconstitutional.",
      "Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have already indicated that they believe the Supreme Court should reverse Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The decision in Humphrey's Executor poses a direct threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty of the American people,\" Thomas wrote in a\u00a0concurring opinion\u00a0to its 2020 decision on the CFPB, which was joined by Gorsuch.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, said that in a future case, he \"would repudiate what is left of this erroneous precedent.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. warned vaccines could turn \"birds into mutant factories.\"",
    "story": [
      "Federal health agencies oppose the use of bird flu vaccines in poultry right now, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, weighing in publicly on it for the first time in his new role. The Trump administration has been considering poultry vaccination as it seeks to combat the outbreak that is fueling a record surge in egg prices.",
      "U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said last month that they were ramping up planning on potentially deploying a vaccine for poultry, with the hopes of putting a draft of the plan before trading partners \"as quickly as possible,\" since it could affect billions of dollars in exports.",
      "\"There's no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity and all three of my health agencies, NIH, CDC, and FDA, the acting heads of those agencies have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News published this week.",
      "Sterilizing immunity means vaccine protection that completely stops infections and spread. Vaccines are rarely able to offer this kind of effectiveness, though the USDA said last month it would step up investments in \"potential new generation vaccines\" with better protection.",
      "Kennedy's remarks mark a sharp turn from the Biden administration, multiple former officials said.",
      "Biden officials from the health and agriculture departments had wrestled extensively with calls to roll out vaccines for animals as outbreaks mounted on farms nationwide. It was concerns from agriculture officials, not human health officials, that ultimately blocked plans to roll out vaccines.",
      "\"At no point did they express a concern or anything other than robust support for an animal vaccination program,\" one former USDA official said of the health agencies.",
      "At the time, Biden-era health officials viewed the ultimate decision as one outside of their expertise and better left to agriculture department experts, two people familiar with the planning said.",
      "Would vaccinating poultry turn birds into \"mutant factories\"?",
      "Kennedy said the new opposition from his health agencies was based on concerns that vaccinating poultry without being able to provide sterilizing immunity would amount to \"turning those birds into mutant factories,\" resulting in worrying genetic changes to the virus.",
      "\"That could actually accelerate the jump to human beings,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Experts say vaccination would need to be managed with strict biosecurity measures \u2014 extra precautions to prevent vaccinated birds from becoming infected \u2014 to reduce the risk of genetic changes in the virus.",
      "\"Creating conditions where the virus can freely mutate increases the likelihood of a strain emerging that can infect humans,\" said Daniel Perez, chair in poultry medicine at the University of Georgia, in an email.",
      "Perez said the risk is higher in large-scale poultry operations, where birds can have weaker immune systems.",
      "But he added that he sees vaccination as a strategic option to curb outbreaks for egg-laying chickens and backyard poultry, alongside other measures like intensive surveillance to detect outbreaks and continued culling of infected flocks of chickens raised for meat.",
      "\"Vaccination can be a useful tool when combined with strict biosecurity. If birds are kept from exposure to the virus, then vaccination can help to contain outbreaks,\" said Perez.",
      "Instead, Perez warned that another idea floated by Trump administration officials could pose a far greater risk: relying on immunity from poultry surviving bird flu infections.",
      "\"We've in fact said, at the USDA, that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,\" Kennedy had said.",
      "Perez said this approach would make surviving birds breeding grounds for worrying mutations.",
      "\"This implies a potentially dangerous misunderstanding of how avian influenza works. Allowing highly pathogenic avian influenza to spread through a poultry flock is extremely risky and counterproductive,\" he said.",
      "The Biden administration opted against vaccinating poultry for different reasons, former officials said.",
      "Agriculture officials had worried it could lead to missed spread of the virus through asymptomatic birds, trigger bans on imports of U.S. poultry products and be logistically challenging to thoroughly administer to massive commercial flocks.",
      "Kennedy's comments come days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released an updated assessment of the virus, finding that the risk remains \"low\" to the general population but higher for people like farm workers or veterinarians who might be exposed to infected animals or contaminated surfaces.",
      "Most confirmed bird flu cases in humans to date have been largely mild, except for a handful of hospitalizations and one death.",
      "The CDC stressed that its assessment of the risk, while low at this time, \"could change, as influenza A viruses can mutate quickly, and therefore have the potential to cause pandemics.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House voted Thursday morning to censure Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas for disrupting President Trump during his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.",
      "In a 224 to 198 vote, the House approved a censure resolution against Green, with 10 Democrats joining all Republicans in favor of the move. Two members, including Green, voted present.",
      "Green is the 28th lawmaker in U.S. history to be censured by the House. After the vote, he was ordered to stand in the well of the chamber while the resolution, which called his behavior \"a breach of proper conduct,\" was read aloud.",
      "Minutes into Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday, Green stood and raised his cane in the president's direction and shouted. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, warned Green to take his seat and \"maintain decorum,\" but Green refused. Johnson then directed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and \"remove this gentleman from the chamber.\"",
      "What does it mean to censure a congressman?",
      "Censure is essentially a formal rebuke by the House for some form of misconduct. The punishment usually requires the censured member to stand in front of the dais in the House chamber while the resolution is read by the presiding member \u2014 Johnson, in Green's case. It does not remove the member from office or impose any other penalties, beyond the reputational damage and historical notoriety that accompanies it.",
      "The practice was relatively rare throughout history, but it has become more frequent in recent years. Three other Democrats \u2014\u00a0Adam Schiff\u00a0of California,\u00a0Rashida Tlaib\u00a0of Michigan and\u00a0Jamaal Bowman\u00a0of New York \u2014 were censured in 2023. Republican Rep. Paul Gosar faced the punishment in 2021.",
      "It was most common during the Civil War and Reconstruction, when 13 members were censured for offenses ranging from assault in the Capitol to insulting another member.",
      "Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington, who introduced the resolution to censure Green, said the move was not personal and called it a \"difficult step.\"",
      "\"We cannot ignore the willful disruption intended to stop a proceeding,\" Newhouse, who is one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the Capitol riot, said Wednesday. \"Without decorum, without respect, what do we got? What do we have, truly?\"",
      "Newhouse said Green's behavior reflects on all members of Congress and the moment serves as a reminder \"that we all need to raise our level of accountability.\"",
      "\"This is truly a wakeup call for this chamber,\" he said. \"The lack of decorum has reached a new low. When the president of the United States cannot even come into our chamber invited and complete his speech without the interaction that we saw last night, we have to take this action of censure.\"",
      "Before Green spoke during floor debate on the resolution Wednesday, he walked over to Newhouse and shook his hand. Green said he did not hold any ill will toward Johnson, the officers who escorted him out of the president's speech or those who supported his censure.",
      "\"The president indicated that he had a mandate. I said to the president, 'You do not have a mandate to cut Medicaid.' I have constituents who need Medicaid. They will suffer and some will die if they don't get Medicaid,\" Green said of why he heckled Mr. Trump. \"I would do it again.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said Republicans have shown \"selective outrage\" in their condemnation of certain behavior.",
      "\"I can't believe we're having this debate,\" McGovern said Wednesday.",
      "The conservative House Freedom Caucus, however, thought that the censure did not go far enough and is seeking to remove Green from his committee assignment. The group said it will introduce a resolution to strip him of his seat on the House Financial Services Committee, and expects Johnson to bring it up for a vote next week.",
      "\"Green was censured in a bipartisan vote but he needs real consequences to demonstrate that no one gets to disrupt the People's business in lame attempts to derail President Trump's agenda,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the caucus.",

      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island barred the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance, extending the block he put in place weeks ago in a case brought by a group of 23 states and the District of Columbia while the case moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued a preliminary injunction Thursday that prohibits agencies from halting the flow of federal funds awarded to the states through grants, contracts or other financial assistance based on a memo from the Office of Management and Budget issued during President Trump's first days in office.",
      "\"The executive's categorical freeze of appropriated and obligated funds fundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government,\" McConnell, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, wrote. \"The interaction of the three co-equal branches of government is an intricate, delicate, and sophisticated balance \u2014 but it is crucial to our form of constitutional governance. Here, the executive put itself above Congress.\"",
      "The judge said that the OMB order freezing federal funds across the government was \"without regard to Congress's authority to control spending,\" and found that the Trump administration failed to point to any statutory or constitutional authority to impose the government-wide pause.",
      "\"The court is not limiting the executive's discretion or micromanaging the administration of federal funds,\" McConnell wrote. \"Rather, consistent with the Constitution, statutes, and caselaw, the court is simply holding that the executive's discretion to impose its own policy preferences on appropriated funds can be exercised only if it is authorized by the congressionally approved appropriations statutes.\"",
      "He said that the freeze has impacted an array of programs, including Head Start and other childcare initiatives, as well as law enforcement and public safety agencies that rely on the federal dollars.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is part of the coalition of states challenging the freeze, cheered the decision and reiterated that the power of the purse rests with Congress.",
      "\"The Trump administration's illegal funding freeze jeopardized law enforcement funding, essential health care and childcare services, and other critical programs that millions of Americans rely on,\" James said in a statement.",
      "McConnell had issued a temporary order at the end of January that ordered OMB to keep federal assistance flowing. His decision, as well as a February order finding that the Trump administration failed to comply with that directive, has made him a target of Mr. Trump's supporters. He is one of several federal judges who have ruled against the Trump administration at the early stages of cases and faced threats of impeachment by congressional Republicans.",
      "The case before McConnell was brought by the group of states and the District of Columbia in response to the OMB memo issued in late January that called for federal agencies to temporarily pause grants, loans and other federal assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders.",
      "The memo targeted roughly $3 trillion in federal assistance programs.",
      "Shortly after it was issued, OMB walked back the memo amid widespread chaos and confusion over what funds were at risk, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said only the memo was rescinded, and the freeze itself would remain in force.",
      "The states brought their challenge to the OMB funding freeze in late January and argued that the directive violated federal law and the separation of powers.",
      "In his decision, McConnell called OMB's pause on federal assistance \"indiscriminate and unpredictable,\" and he said it is \"disingenuous\" to suggest that the challenged pauses stem from independent agency decisions, instead of the OMB directive.",
      "\"Overall, the OMB directive amounted to a command, not a suggestion, that agency defendants shall execute a categorical, indefinite funding freeze to align funding decisions with the president's priorities,\" the judge wrote.",
      "He also noted that there is no evidence Mr. Trump followed the federal law that lays out the procedures for withholding or cutting money appropriated by Congress, the Impoundment Control Act. The law requires the president to send a special message to Congress detailing the request to rescind or withhold funds, which McConnell said Mr. Trump did not do.",
      "McConnell wrote that the Trump administration \"abruptly froze\" billions of dollars in federal funding for an indefinite period of time.",
      "\"It is difficult to perceive any rationality in this decision \u2014 let alone thoughtful consideration of practical consequences \u2014 when these funding pauses endanger the states' ability to provide vital services, including but not limited to public safety, health care, education, childcare, and transportation infrastructure,\" he said.",
      "Similar challenges are underway in federal district courts across the East Coast. A judge in Washington, D.C., has also barred the Trump administration from pausing the federal aid.",
      "The OMB funding freeze is among an array of actions taken since Mr. Trump returned to office that is part of his plan to shrink the size of the federal government and spending. He created the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to spearhead the effort. Mr. Trump has said DOGE is led by Elon Musk, though the White House has claimed its acting administrator is Amy Gleason, who has worked for DOGE's precursor entity.",

They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Under prior policy, the government negotiated those rates with institutions. As an example, an institution with a 50% indirect cost rate would get another $50,000 to cover indirect expenses for a $100,000 project. The NIH's new policy would cap indirect costs at a flat rate of 15% instead, calculated to save the agency $4 billion a year.",

      "The Justice Department on Wednesday announced it is investigating the University of California system over allegations of antisemitism in the wake of protests that broke out on several campuses over the war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\"This Department of Justice will always defend Jewish Americans, protect civil rights, and leverage our resources to eradicate institutional Antisemitism in our nation's universities,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "The probe, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, will look into whether UC \"engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination based on race, religion and national origin against its professors, staff and other employees by allowing an Antisemitic hostile work environment to exist on its campuses,\" the DOJ statement said.",
      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza, student encampments popped up on a number of college campuses across the country \u2014 including at UCLA and other UC system campuses. Many of the protesters were calling for an end to the war, a U.S. arms embargo on Israel and for their universities to divest from Israel. But in some instances, acts of antisemitism were alleged, and some Jewish students said the encampments and encounters with protesters made them feel unsafe.",
      "Some critics have called the encampments themselves antisemitic, with some, including President Trump, likening the protesters to terrorists.",
      "The protests on UCLA's campus last year made national headlines when a group of counter-protesters \"came to Royce Quad and violently attacked students, faculty, and staff members who were engaged in an encampment at that location,\" UCLA said at the time. The clash lasted several hours into the night, with video posted to social media showing fireworks and tear gas being launched into the encampment.",
      "In a statement announcing the probe, Leo Terrell, a member of the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism and senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said: \"The impact upon UC's students has been the subject of considerable media attention and multiple federal investigations. But these campuses are also workplaces, and the Jewish faculty and staff employed there deserve a working environment free of antisemitic hostility and hate. The President, the Attorney General and this Task Force are committed to combatting antisemitism for all Jewish Americans.\"",
      "The University of California Office of the President told CBS News in a statement: \"We were recently notified of the Department of Justice's decision to initiate a civil rights investigation in the University of California system. We want to be clear: the University of California is unwavering in its commitment to combating antisemitism and protecting everyone's civil rights. We continue to take specific steps to foster an environment free of harassment and discrimination for everyone in the university community.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to pull federal funding from any school that continued to allow what he called \"illegal protests.\"",
      "\"All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,\" the president wrote on social media. \"Agitators will be imprisoned/or permanently sent back to the country from which they came. American students will be permanently expelled or, depending on the crime, arrested. NO MASKS!\"",
      "The campus protests last year led to hearings on Capitol Hill, with the presidents of several universities \u2014 including Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania \u2014 being called to testify about their handling of the encampments and reports of antisemitism on their campuses.",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with the Trump administration in allowing the immediate removal of Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel while the court battle continues. Dellinger is likely to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Mr. Trump last month after he was fired even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \"only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Dellinger's lawyers say allowing the president to fire the special counsel without cause would have a chilling effect on the important duties of the office to protect whistleblowers. The ruling comes as Dellinger is also challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's shakeup of the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the law protecting the special counsel from removal is unconstitutional and unfairly prevents the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "Jackson on Saturday ruled that Dellinger's firing was unlawful and ordered that he remain in his post. But the appeals court lifted Jackson's order blocking his removal while the court considers legal arguments in the case.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing. It investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "After a request from Dellinger's office, a government panel that enforces workers' rights ruled Wednesday that more than 5,000 employees fired by the Trump administration should be put back on the job at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",

    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander is \"alive,\" but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",

      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

      "A little over a month after\u00a0a civilian jet broke the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic and NASA have released a photo of one of the aircraft's\u00a0historic test flights over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The image released Monday shows the XB-1 aircraft, which Boom Supersonic said is the \"first civil supersonic jet made in America,\" during its second supersonic flight on Feb. 10. The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",
      "NASA first visually captured supersonic shock waves in 2019 after a decade of research. The technology was developed in part to aid the space agency in\u00a0testing its own supersonic aircraft, X-59.",

      "SpaceX launched its huge Starship rocket on the program's eighth test flight Thursday, but a malfunction of some sort triggered multiple upper stage engine shutdowns and the vehicle failed to reach its planned sub-orbital altitude, breaking apart in a spectacular shower of debris.",
      "It was the second failure in a row for a Starship upper stage, a vehicle critical to NASA's plans to return astronauts to the moon in the next few years.",
      "\"During Starship's ascent burn, the vehicle experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly and contact was lost. Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses,\" SpaceX said in a statement.",
      "\"We will review the data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"Obviously, a lot to go through, a lot to dig through. We're going to go right at it,\" said SpaceX launch commentator Dan Huot. \"The primary reason we do these flight tests is to learn. We have some more to learn about this vehicle, but we're going to be right back here in the not-too-distant future, and we're going to get a ship to space.\"",

      "Three days after a last-minute scrub due to unspecified technical issues, SpaceX fired up the Super Heavy first stage's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines at 6:30 p.m. EST. Two seconds later, the tallest, most powerful rocket in the world lifted off from the company's launch site on the Texas Gulf Coast.",

      "After boosting the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere, the 230-foot-tall, 30-foot-wide Super Heavy first stage booster flew itself back to the launch site and into the grasp of two giant mechanical arms known as \"chopsticks\" mounted on the side of the launch tower.",
      "The chopsticks closed around the slowly descending booster, locking onto structural capture fixtures on both sides of the rocket. The dramatic launch pad capture, SpaceX's third, is a key element in the company's plan to enable rapid refurbishment and reuse.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship upper stage, meanwhile, climbed toward space as planned on the power of six Raptor engines, appearing to work flawlessly as it soared skyward toward the planned sub-orbital trajectory.",
      "Trouble 8 minutes after liftoff",
      "But a little more than eight minutes after liftoff, telemetry shown on SpaceX's live webcast indicated four of the six engines had prematurely shut down. A camera on the Starship showed the spacecraft starting to spin about and several seconds later contact was lost.",
      "Multiple videos posted on social media showed a dramatic shower of debris arcing back toward Earth after the vehicle broke up. It wasn't immediately clear if the breakup was triggered by the Starship's self-destruct system or by extreme structural loads as it fell back into the lower atmosphere.",
      "While SpaceX will no doubt attempt its usual rapid recovery, the Federal Aviation Administration will almost certainly order another failure investigation. Given two destructive breakups in a row, it could take longer to return to flight status this time around.",
      "The flight plan called for a battery of tests, including the deployment of four simulated Starlink satellites to test the Starship's payload release system, the in-space restart of one of the rocket's Raptor engines and tests of new heat shield materials and components needed for the eventual pad capture of returning Starships.",
      "At the conclusion of the sub-orbital flight, the Starship was expected fall back into the atmosphere belly first. Once past the region of maximum atmospheric heating, the rocket was programmed to flip into a vertical orientation before settling to a tail-first rocket-powered \"soft landing\" in the Indian Ocean near Australia.",

      "Three minutes after that, the rocket's self-destruct system triggered an explosion that broke the Starship apart, producing a spectacular shower of flaming debris that rained down along the flight path.",
      "Telemetry indicated the fire broke out after propellant lines leading to one of the Raptors ruptured due to unexpected harmonic vibrations. SpaceX carried out a 60-second engine test firing of the Starship launched Monday, studying responses to various thrust levels.",
      "Based on the test results, propellant feed lines were modified, fuel temperatures were changed and thrust levels were adjusted to avoid any such harmonic responses. Additional vents were installed in the area where the fire broke out and a nitrogen purge system was added to minimize the chance of fire.",

The crew will transfer to the waiting Starship for the descent to the lunar surface. NASA hopes to send the first woman and the next man to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe, after an unpiloted Starship moon landing.",
      "Rapid reusability is a key element of the program given the number of Super Heavy-Starships that will be required for a single moon landing. Multiple successful test flights will be needed to perfect the system and demonstrate the reliability required to carry astronauts.",
      "The latest mishap comes amid ambitious SpaceX plans for major upgrades to the company's facilities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, building a 380-foot-tall building where Super Heavy boosters and Starships can be refurbished and processed for launch from one and possibly two Florida launch pads.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander is \"alive,\" but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
    "story": [
      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",
      "Second lunar lander to reach moon this year",
      "Athena's arrival is the second of three to reach the moon this year.",
      "A lander built by Austin-based\u00a0Firefly Aerospace successfully touched down on the moon early Sunday, March 2. The commercially-developed Blue Ghost lander is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments designed to collect data needed for the Artemis program.",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million for delivery of the agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations to the moon's surface. The instruments cost NASA another $44 million.",
      "Athena's instruments and technology demonstrations also were funded by NASA. The agency paid the company $62.5 million to deliver a powerful drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon's surface.",
      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",
      "In the meantime, a Japanese lander known as Resilience was launched in January atop the same Falcon 9 rocket that boosted the Blue Ghost into space. Built by Tokyo-based ispace, Resilience took a longer, low-energy route to the moon and will not arrive until early June.",

      "\"Find them before they find you. The sooner you find them, the more options you have for deflecting potentially hazardous asteroids,\" Moskovitz said.",
      "In 2022, NASA performed a first-of-its-kind test. The agency intentionally crashed a spacecraft into a small asteroid, nudging it just enough to change its trajectory. The mission gave the space agency a tool that could potentially be used to counter an asteroid heading for our planet.",
      "\"It's the only natural disaster that we could potentially prevent,\" said NASA's acting planetary defense officer Kelly Fast. \"And if you were to find an impact threat to Earth well enough in advance, then you wouldn't have to deflect it much for it to be able to miss the Earth in the future.\"",
      "The Lowell Discovery Telescope in northern Arizona is one of a handful around the world searching the night sky for asteroids that could potentially threaten Earth.",
      "\"We can see orders of magnitude fainter than you would be able to with your naked eye,\" Moskovitz explained.",
      "2024 YR4, \"city killer\" asteroid",
      "Since December, Moskovitz had the Lowell Discovery Telescope trained on the 2024 YR4 asteroid. Scientists at one point projected it had about a 3% chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
      "2024 YR4 is now expected to miss Earth and \"no longer poses a significant threat,\" according to a recent analysis from NASA. It has approximately a 0.004% chance of hitting the planet in eight years, new calculations show.",
      "\"The latest observations have further reduced the uncertainty of its future trajectory, and the range of possible locations the asteroid could be on Dec. 22, 2032, has moved farther away from the Earth,\" NASA said.",
      "However, there is a 1.7% chance that it could impact the moon.",
      "Previous impacts of asteroids",
      "In 2013, a small asteroid, just 60 feet wide, exploded over Russia, injuring more than 1,600 people.",
      "An asteroid big enough to wipe out an entire city crashed to Earth 50,000 years ago in what is now northern Arizona. It left a crater that was three quarters of a mile wide and 600 feet deep.",

    "summary": "Starliner commander Barry Wilmore offered an even-handed response to questions about the intrusion of politics into his ISS mission.",
    "story": [
      "Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore said Tuesday he did not think politics played any role in the crew's extended mission, but he did not directly address earlier comments by President Trump and Elon Musk that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"Obviously, we've heard some of these different things that have been said,\" Wilmore said during an orbital news conference. \"I can tell you at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk and obviously, respect and admiration for our president of the United States, Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"The words they've said, politics, I mean, that's part of life. We understand that. And there's an important reason why we have a political system and the political system that we do have, and we're behind it 100%.\"",
      "Wilmore and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams said in earlier comments that they didn't feel stranded or abandoned. But again on Tuesday, the crew took multiple questions about what some see as the intrusion of politics on their mission.",
      "\"From my standpoint, politics is not playing into this at all,\" Wilmore said. \"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. And we did that.\"",
      "Wilmore and Williams, both former military test pilots, launched to the International Space Station\u00a0on June 5 last year aboard a Boeing Starliner crew ferry ship for a mission that was expected to last about eight days.",
      "The Starliner docked at the outpost the day after launch, but the ship ran into multiple problems with its propulsion system during its approach to the lab.",
      "In mid August, after a detailed engineering analysis, Boeing managers argued the problems were well understood and could be safely managed during the crew's return to Earth. But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",
      "Given that the ISS is operated by NASA and multiple partner nations, the Starliner pilot said they should make the most out of it for taxpayers and international partners and \"hold our obligations and do that world-class science that this laboratory is capable of.\"",
      "If all goes well, Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov will blast off and head for the space station on March 12.",
      "Once on board, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams will help their replacements settle in before undocking and returning to Earth around March 19.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 19:36:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Blue Ghost touchdown kicks off two weeks of around-the-clock research by NASA science and technology payloads.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound.

      "\"Companies may choose not to track the presence of these ingredients/compounds due to concern about future litigation,\" the report said.",
      "Some additives can remain hidden from the public behind such catchall terms as \"spices\" and \"artificial flavors,\" as the Center for Science in the Public Interest has reported, or shrouded by other exemptions from disclosure requirements.",
      "And some ingredients that should have been listed on product labels \u2014 potential allergens such as milk, wheat, eggs, and dyes \u2014 have at times gone undisclosed, according to a series of food recalls. Gaps in oversight have alarmed political leaders on both sides of the aisle, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, watchdog groups such as the CSPI, and academic researchers.",
      "Adding to the concern: the profusion of ultra-processed foods, which use a wide array of chemicals to add flavor and color, extend shelf life, reduce cost, control texture or consistency, and generally tempt people to eat more. Ultra-processed foods now make up 73% of the U.S. food supply, researchers have estimated. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has said there's growing evidence they are \"deliberately designed to be addictive,\" contributing to an epidemic of obesity \u2014 a rare point of agreement between him and Kennedy.",
      "At his confirmation hearing, Makary said some ingredients cause a chronic, low-grade inflammatory reaction in the gastrointestinal tract. \"And what are we doing? We are drugging our nation's children at scale,\" he said.",
      "The KFF poll found that 58% of respondents want the Trump administration to prioritize setting stricter limits on chemicals in the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, which represents many of the largest food-makers, defends the regulatory system as \"rigorous,\" \"evidence-based,\" and \"proven.\" The system enables companies \"to innovate to meet consumer demand,\" Sarah Gallo, the association's senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement to KFF Health News.",
      "\"Food manufacturers attest to the safety of an ingredient through the development of extensive scientific evidence and third-party expert review,\" Gallo added.",
      "More than a decade ago, Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that there were about 10,000 additives allowed in food in the United States \u2014 and that the FDA had not reviewed the safety of about 3,000 of them.",
      "\"The system is fundamentally broken,\" said Thomas Neltner, one of the authors of the Pew study. \"It's so bad, nobody knows \u2014 not even FDA knows \u2014 what's in our food.\"",
      "Banned abroad",
      "The FDA allows titanium dioxide to be used to enhance the appearance of foods, among other purposes. According to an Environmental Working Group database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 1,900 products, including many candies.",
      "The European Union takes a more cautious approach. In 2021, an EU regulatory panel concluded that titanium dioxide \"can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive.\" The panel said it couldn't rule out the possibility that titanium dioxide could damage chromosomes.",
      "The FDA allows potassium bromate\u00a0to be used in baking, and, according to the EWG database, it's listed as an ingredient in more than 200 products, including bread, buns, and bagels.",
      "Potassium bromate has been banned from food in many countries, including those of the European Union, Canada, India, and Peru. In 2023, California banned it from food effective in 2027. The United Kingdom prohibited it in 1990. The International Agency for Research on Cancer identified it as possibly carcinogenic more than 25 years ago. A joint committee of the United Nations and the World Health Organization identified it as a \"genotoxic carcinogen\" in 1992.",
      "On its website, the FDA says it has worked with industry to minimize potassium bromate levels and is reviewing the chemical, among others.",
      "The EWG says that it created the database to help consumers make healthier choices and that the raw data on product labels is supplied by Label Insight \u2014 which is owned by NielsenIQ, a major provider of data to industry. The EWG has called for tighter regulation of foods.",
      "Based on a review of FDA and European Commission databases, it appears that at least 950 more additives are used in foods in the United States than are allowed in the European Union, said Erik Millstone, an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex in England who has been studying food safety policy since the 1970s.",
      "Direct comparisons are difficult because the two regulatory systems and the way they keep their records differ greatly.",
      "A definitive count is elusive because the FDA doesn't require industry to inform it of everything used in foods in the United States.",
      "\"That kind of casual neglect totally would be unacceptable in Europe,\" Millstone said.",
      "\"Several decades behind Europeans\"",
      "When the FDA formally approves substances for use in food, it can let decades pass without reassessing them \u2014 even when subsequent research raises doubts about their safety.",
      "In January, when the FDA banned Red Dye No. 3 from foods, it cited research published in 1987. (The FDA said it had no evidence the dye puts people at risk; invoking one of the stricter consumer protections, it said a law from 1960 prohibits the use of additives found to induce cancer in animals.)",
      "In the European Union, substances used in foods must pass regulatory approval before being introduced. The EU has also required that its regulators reassess all additives that were on the market before Jan. 20, 2009, a process that is ongoing.",
      "\"In the FDA, although we have authorization to do post-market reviews, there's no statutory mandate to do them,\" Jones, the former deputy commissioner of the FDA's Human Foods Program, told a Senate committee in December. \"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past.\"",
      "The FDA website lists 19 post-market determinations since 2010 that substances were not \"generally recognized as safe.\" Four involve chemical constituents of one mushroom and the mushroom itself. Others include an anabolic steroid, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, cannabidiol (CBD), Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, and partially hydrogenated oils.",
      "Meanwhile, trichloroethylene, banned by the Environmental Protection Agency in December as \"an extremely toxic chemical known to cause liver cancer, kidney cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,\" is still allowed under FDA rules for use as a solvent in the production of foods.",
      "FDA spokesperson Enrico Dinges said the agency will work with new leadership at HHS \"to safeguard the food supply through pre-market and post-market safety evaluations of chemicals in the food supply.\"",
      "\"The loophole swallowed the law\"",
      "The biggest gap in the FDA's oversight of foods goes back generations.",
      "In 1958, Congress mandated that, before additives could be used in foods, manufacturers had to prove they were safe and get FDA approval. However, Congress carved out an exception for substances \"generally recognized as safe,\" which came to be known simply as GRAS.",
      "As conceived, GRAS promised regulatory relief for standard ingredients like salt, sugar, vinegar, and baking powder \u2014 along with many chemicals.",
      "Over time, \"the loophole swallowed the law,\" said a 2014 report by Neltner and Maricel Maffini for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Companies can unilaterally decide their ingredients are already recognized as safe and use them without asking the FDA for permission or even informing the agency.",
      "A better translation of GRAS would be \"Generally Recognized as SECRET,\" the Natural Resources Defense Council report said.",
      "A federal watchdog reached a similar conclusion. \"GRAS substances can be marketed without FDA's approval or even its knowledge,\" the Government Accountability Office warned in 2010.",
      "That spared the FDA from spending time reviewing countless substances.",
      "For advice on whether ingredients are GRAS, companies may convene panels of specialists. The FDA has noted that panel members could be paid by the companies commissioning the review, but, in guidance to industry, it says \"such compensation is not itself an unacceptable conflict.\"",
      "About 3,000 flavoring ingredients have been deemed GRAS by a panel of scientists working for an industry group, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States, known as FEMA, said George Southworth, the organization's executive director.",
      "The scientists on the FEMA panel \"adhere to stringent conflict-of-interest policies,\" and their GRAS determinations are submitted to the FDA, which includes them in an online database, Southworth said.",
      "Southworth described the panel as independent, and the FEMA website says panel members have never been employees of companies in the food industry.",
      "Asked how many times FEMA's panel found that a flavoring didn't meet the test, Southworth wouldn't say. He indicated that some reviews are called off before a conclusion is reached.",
      "\"Publicly reporting these numbers without full context could lead to misinterpretations about the safety of substances,\" he added.",
      "Another way",
      "Food companies have another option: They can voluntarily notify the FDA that they believe their product is GRAS for its intended use and lay out their reasons \u2014 giving the FDA a heads up and essentially seeking its blessing.",
      "If they take that route, they don't have to wait for an answer from the FDA to begin marketing the product, the agency has said.",
      "And they don't risk much. If the FDA spots weaknesses in a company's argument or reasons to worry about a chemical's safety, it routinely calls off its review instead of declaring the substance unsafe.",
      "FDA records posted on the agency's website show that the FDA often coaches companies to ask the agency to cease its evaluation. That, too, leaves the company free to sell the product, food watchdogs said.",
      "For companies that voluntarily run their products past the FDA, victory is a letter saying the agency has no questions.",
      "But if companies market products as \"generally recognized as safe\" without firm grounds, they run the risk that the FDA could one day take enforcement action, such as issuing a warning or stopping sales. That's if the FDA notices.",
      "Psyched out",
      "On March 8, 2022, a Canadian company, Psyched Wellness, issued a news release saying it had a green light to market products in the United States.",
      "An \"independent review panel of scientific experts\" concluded that an extract the company developed, AME-1, was \"Generally Recognized As Safe,\" paving the way for it to be sold in bulk and used as an ingredient, the company said.",
      "The company described the panel's judgment as a successful \"certification\" and \"a key milestone.\" The extract was derived from a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria, which the company said \"has incredible healing and medicinal powers.\" As the company later put it in a news release, it had obtained \"self-Gras status.\"",
      "In June 2024, the company announced that it would soon release Amanita muscaria watermelon gummies.",
      "However, the FDA later took issue with the company and its product.",
      "In a memo dated Sept. 9, 2024, an FDA toxicologist said Psyched Wellness' claim of GRAS certification was false. The firm failed to show that its extract was generally recognized as safe, the FDA memo said.",
      "Speaking of the mushroom, its extracts, and its known \"pharmacologically active constituents,\" the FDA memo posted on the agency's website said they have \"potential for serious harm and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\"",
      "The FDA was focusing on the mushroom against the backdrop of a spate of medical problems linked to another company's \"Diamond Shruumz\" brand chocolate bars, gummies, and infused cones. When it recalled those products in June 2024, that other company announced that a chemical found in Amanita mushrooms was a possible cause of symptoms, including seizures and loss of consciousness.",
      "The FDA memo discussed that recall and said one death and 30 hospitalizations might have been related.",
      "The memo did not connect Psyched Wellness to the outbreak or the Diamond Shruumz products.",
      "The chief executive of Psyched Wellness, Jeffrey Stevens, did not respond to an interview request or written questions.",
      "As recently as Feb. 1, Psyched Wellness said in a securities filing that it will \"continue to market its products in the U.S. using the Self-GRAS designation.\"",
      "\"Probably poisoning us\"",
      "If food ingredients cause acute reactions \u2014 sending people to emergency rooms, for example \u2014 the potential dangers may be relatively easy to identify, and regulatory action might naturally follow. Some critics of the system say they worry more about health effects that could take years or decades to develop.",
      "Then, when it's too late, it could be hard to trace the harm to any particular ingredient.",
      "All that leaves Joseph Shea of Myrtle Beach in a tough spot.",
      "For a while, Shea tried shopping at a market that has a lot of organic offerings, he said in an interview. That proved too expensive.",
      "Shea said the entire picture is \"incredibly frustrating.\"",
      "\"They're probably poisoning us, and we don't know,\" he said. \"We'll figure it out 30 years down the road when we get sick.\"",

    "story": [
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, says Ukrainians brought the pause in U.S. intelligence sharing \"on themselves.\"",
      "It's \"sort of like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across the nose,\" Kellogg said of the impact of the intelligence pause on the battlefield. \"Got their attention.\"",
      "The intelligence the U.S. has been sharing has been critical in helping Ukraine strike Russian military targets, as well as anticipate and block Russian attacks.",
      "\"But it's a pause. It's not an end,\" Kellogg told CBS News chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan in an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations Thursday. \"But it's sort of of like, okay, we're trying to get your attention.\"",
      "\"That's a pretty major concession to Russia, to constrain Ukraine's ability to target and hit Russian forces,\" Brennan said, pointing out, \"this pressure really seems to be directly impacting, potentially, what they can do on the battlefield.\"",
      "\"Very candidly, they brought it on themselves,\" Kellogg responded, to hisses from the audience.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe acknowledged the intelligence sharing pause Wednesday, a move that followed the contentious White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last Friday. The meeting with President Trump was supposed to culminate in the signing of a rare earth minerals deal but instead ended in recrimination, as Zelenskyy sought to remind the president and Vice President JD Vance of the treaties Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken in the past, while Mr. Trump and Vance berated the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office, accusing him of not saying \"thank you\" for U.S. military aid.",
      "Though Kellogg indicated that intelligence sharing could resume, he declined to say when. \"That's up to the president of the United States,\" he told Brennan.",
      "Kellogg also said the Trump administration would be willing to work with Zelenskyy once the minerals agreement is finalized.",
      "\"Sign a document, and then once you sign the document that you want to go forward, that you're serious about it, then I think you can move forward,\" said Kellogg. \"When I was in Kyiv two weeks ago, I was very clear to President Zelenskyy \u2014 the outcome if we didn't have a signed agreement.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is now likely to be the administration official who signs the deal with Ukraine. And next week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff expects to meet with Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, he told reporters Thursday.",
      "Witkoff met with Putin for about three and a half hours last month in Russia and returned to the U.S. with \"an indication of where the Russians are\" on peace negotiations, Kellogg said.",
      "\"We want to do the same thing with the Ukrainians, as well,\" Kellogg told Brennan.",
      "Notably, Kellogg denied an earlier statement by Witkoff that the Istanbul protocol, drafted shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, could serve as the basis for a peace deal framework between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "The right-leaning Institute for the Study of War describes the Istanbul protocol as \"entirely incompatible with the current stated U.S. policy\" and argues it \"cannot be the basis or guidepost for negotiations that amount to anything other than capitulation to Russia's pre-war demands.\"",
      "The institute noted that a draft of that agreement would have had Ukraine surrender its sovereignty and would have prevented it from maintaining armed forces sufficient to deter a Russian attack.",
      "\"Steve said it's a departure point. I think that's a good word to use,\" said Kellogg. \"I don't believe for all of us that that is an equitable framework. And I think we have to develop something entirely new,\" he continued.",
      "\"I think Steve made a comment as a general comment, and it is not the Trump administration policy\u00a0 because they haven't made their policy,\" he added.",
      "At this point, Kellogg estimates that the Ukrainians should have enough military aid to continue fighting through the summer.",
      "\"They have an ability with the assets they've got to continue to prosecute the fight, to do it,\" said Kellogg.",
      "Kellogg would not confirm that as part of a peace agreement the U.S. would backstop any European peacekeeping forces by providing security guarantees to Ukraine.",
      "\"That's part of the discussion we're having with the Europeans as well \u2014 when you talk what does [a] backstop look like,\" said Kellogg.",
      "\"What does that look like on the economic side, what do sanctions look like, what do frozen assets, whatever it's going to be? And then we also look at the military side as well,\" he said.",
      "Beyond bringing the conflict to a close, Kellogg also said president seeks a \"reset\" of U.S. relations with Russia.",
      "\"The need to reset relations with Russia to secure Americans' vital national interest, and ultimately, to stop U.S. entanglement in an endless proxy war, are the driving reasons why President Trump's approach and the framing of this war is distinct from the broader, conventional approach that we see publicly to the war,\" said Kellogg.",
      "He acknowledged, however, that existing sanctions against Russia need to be enforced more aggressively to be more effective.",
      "If you ranked U.S. sanctions against Russia on a scale of 1 to 7, he said, \"the problem is with enforcement, we're probably at a 3.\"",

      "President Trump on Thursday said he will pause 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada that are covered under a 2020 trade agreement, delaying levies\u00a0imposed on the nations\u00a0earlier this week.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the delay in the Mexico tariffs in a social media post after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. On Thursday afternoon, he signed two executive orders stating the exemptions would apply to U.S. imports of products from both Mexico and Canada that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Goods that are not covered by the agreement remain subject to tariffs.",
      "\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Mr. Trump wrote, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He characterized the move \"as an accommodation\" for the Mexican leader.",
      "\"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border, both in terms of stopping Illegal Aliens from entering the United States and, likewise, stopping Fentanyl. Thank you to President Sheinbaum for your hard work and cooperation!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "When asked if any concessions had been offered by Canada or Mexico to lead to the pause, a White House official told CBS News that during leader-to-leader discussions, Mexico brought up progress it had made cracking down on cartels and drugs, including cocaine.",
      "The USMCA agreement covers the vast majority of imports from Mexico. In a press conference Thursday, Sheinbaum said that nearly all of Mexico's trade with the U.S. is covered under the trade pact which is in effect until April 2.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Canadian energy, which is not included in the USMCA, is expected to be tariffed at 10%, which could boost gas prices and heating and electricity costs in the U.S. Potash that U.S. farmers import from Canada would be tariffed at the same rate.",
      "According to a White House official, in 2024, 38% of all imports from Canada were covered by the USMCA and therefore exempt from tariffs, while 49.6% of all imports from Mexico were covered under the agreement.",
      "International trade expert Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"a massive amount of goods\" fall under the brief exemption from tariffs on imports from Canada. They include auto parts, steel and aluminum, beef and other products.",
      "Despite the brief reprieve. uncertainty around the tariffs have \"broken complex supply chains that will never be fixed,\" Appleton said.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, underlined the importance of cooperation on trade.",
      "\"Though today's delay mitigates some of economic damage U.S. tariffs will cause, this is not a moment to celebrate. The economy is not a toy to play with. Constant threats and economic uncertainty have taken their toll. We see it in delayed business investments, shaky consumer confidence, stalled capital flows and a volatile stock market. People's livelihoods are at stake,\" he said in a statement provided to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The only outcome that makes sense for both economies is for all tariffs to be taken off the table, without exception,\" Holmes added.",
      "Economists have warned that tariffs are likely to lead to price increases on an array of goods, from vegetables and fruit to automobiles. Levies on materials from Canada and Mexico used in car production won't go into effect immediately after Mr. Trump also issued one-month exemption from tariffs for automakers Wednesday, following conversations with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram.",
      "Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs before, and business leaders say uncertainty around which policies will actually take effect has created confusion for businesses and consumers.",

      "This story is part of a CBS Reports documentary, \"The Price of Milk,\" that goes inside the supply chain, from farm-to-table. It airs Sunday, March 9, on CBS News 24/7 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.",
      "Petaluma, California \u2014 In California, America's No. 1 dairy producer, Manuel Castro from El Salvador plays a vital role in getting milk to market.",
      "\"It's a process, and in this process, it's 24 hours, every day\u2026no holidays,\" Castro told CBS News.",
      "Castro has resided in California for about 30 years and became a U.S. citizen in 2009. On this particular day, he loads nearly 5,000 gallons of milk into a tank, which will be taken to a processing plant before eventually making its way to stores within 24 hours.",
      "Castro works for Moga Transportation, a company with humble beginnings that has grown over the last two decades into a fleet of dairy haulers.",
      "\"We have close to 90 trucks,\" said Harwinder Singh Brar, who co-owns Moga Transportation with his wife, Prab Gill.",
      "More than three billion tons of agricultural products are moved across the U.S. every year, according to Bureau of Transportation statistics, with trucks carrying the majority of that freight.",
      "Brar is a Punjabi Sikh from India who first came to the U.S. in 1998 with his field hockey team. Instead of returning home, he stayed and sought asylum because of the religious persecution he faced in his home country.",
      "Some of his employees have been with the company for a decade or more. Brar says he tries to ensure they are well-treated.",
      "\"Well, this is my family,\" Brar said. \"They're not employees. They're family to us.\"",
      "Brar says trucking relies on immigrant labor. He speculates that without it, the industry would \"shut down.\"",
      "\"Well, trucking would shut down because it's primarily immigrants now,\" Gill explained. \"It's changed so much.\"",

      "\"If I hired Americans to do the work, I would have to pay probably about $100,000 a year per person, and they would only work maybe 40-50 hours a week at that rate,\" farmer John Rosenow said. \"Clearly, I couldn't be able to afford to pay Americans as much as they want.\"",
      "Says Castro, \"It's about working hard. These people, wake up, two o'clock in the morning, one o'clock in the morning, they go out. You know, they finish around 11, 10 at night. The milk doesn't stop. It doesn't stop.\"",

      "The surviving roommates, who are identified in court documents as B.F. and D.M., exchanged text messages between 4:22 a.m. and 4:24 a.m. on the morning of Nov. 13, the new documents show. \u00a0According to the documents, D.M. placed unanswered phone calls to all four victims between 4:19 a.m. and 4:27 a.m.",
      "\"No one is answering,\" D.M. sent to B.F., according to the filing. \"I'm rlly confused rn.\"",
      "D.M. also appeared to reference the intruder, saying, \"I'm freaking out rn\" and \"No it's like a ski mask almost.\" B.F. then urged D.M. to \"run\" downstairs to her room, where the two stayed until later that morning when a 911 call was made.",
      "The documents, filed by the prosecution on Feb. 24, could be used as evidence in the trial of Bryan Kohberger, the 30-year-old former Ph.D. student who is charged with four counts of murder in the case.",

      "A transcript of one of the surviving roommates' 911 phone call at around noon was also filed in separate court documents. The frantic call, which appears to show several people talking to authorities, was made after Kernodle was found unresponsive. One of the callers stated that one of the roommates \"was drunk last night and she's not waking up.\"",

    "summary": "\"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me,\" said Mary Comans, who was FEMA's chief financial officer.",
    "story": [
      "A former government official who says she was falsely accused of illegally sending funds to New York City to book luxury hotels for undocumented migrants \u2014 and then publicly ridiculed and fired \u2014 said Thursday that just days earlier she had been directed by a member of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, to make the payments.",
      "Mary Comans, who was the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, sued the agency and the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, on Tuesday.",
      "\"I was fired illegally by the Trump administration for doing my job, for doing exactly what I was directed to do by the Trump political appointees at the Department of Homeland Security and at the DOGE,\" she told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"They told me to do these actions, to make these payments, and then they fired me.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson did not respond for comment, nor did Brad Smith, the DOGE official Comans says she interacted with.",
      "The lawsuit argues she was \"unlawfully terminated\" from her position \"without cause or the due process required by law and the Constitution.\" As chief financial officer, Comans was a member of the \"senior executive service,\" the highest-level civil servant.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that DHS and FEMA publicly disclosed information about her",
      "termination that was protected under the Privacy Act and that she was defamed by the false portrayal about her conduct. At the time of her dismissal, Comans says the agency suggested falsely in a press release that she was a \"deep state activist.\"",
      "Comans joined DHS in 2004, inspired to serve in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. She called herself \"apolitical,\" noting that she served both Republican and Democratic administrations, often deploying to the scenes of natural disasters to help manage the federal government's response.",
      "\"My job is to serve the administration that was elected by the American people,\" she said.",
      "She had served as FEMA's chief financial officer since 2017 before she was abruptly fired on Feb. 11.",
      "During President Trump's first days back in office, Comans said the executive leadership team at FEMA was fielding executive orders as quickly as the president could sign them and \"were implementing them to the letter that he expected.\"",
      "One of the orders Comans carried out required DHS, and by extension FEMA, to freeze money going to nongovernmental organizations that provide services to undocumented immigrants. Payments that continued came from a $650 million Customs and Border Protection program created by Congress to reimburse cities for housing and sheltering migrants that had entered into the country illegally and were awaiting court proceedings. FEMA administered payments issued by the immigration program, but those funds were separate from the billions of dollars the agency spends on disaster relief.",
      "On Feb. 5, Comans says she and her team met with Smith, one of Elon Musk's top lieutenants, who was overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency's work at DHS. According to Comans, Smith instructed them to keep the funds from the CBP program flowing.",
      "Comans said it was \"very clear\" from the conversation with Smith \"that FEMA was doing the right thing in continuing\" the payments.",
      "\"We also received written guidance from the acting general counsel at FEMA that payments to state and locals needed to continue under the normal course of business,\" she said.",
      "Despite those assurances from Smith, on Feb. 10, Musk posted on X that DOGE \"just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants. Sending this money violated the law and is in gross insubordination to the President's executive order.\"",
      "Later that day, when she arrived at work, Comans says she met with her boss, acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton. She says Hamilton was also surprised by Musk's tweet and told her she had done nothing wrong. Comans then drafted a report, which CBS News reviewed, that documented her conversations with DOGE.",
      "\"I told him I was going to put together an after-action report detailing each of the conversations, the dates, the actions that FEMA took to show that we were operating within the guidelines provided to use by the Trump administration,\" Comans said. \"He thanked me, hugged me and again reassured me that nobody at FEMA would be fired for making these payments.\"",
      "Comans said she had another conversation with Hamilton that night to tell him that the funds had been recouped.",
      "\"I shared with him that I had successfully reversed the payment and the funds were being returned to Treasury as we speak,\" she said.",
      "The next morning, on Feb. 11, Comans says a colleague walked into Coman's office to tell her that she had been terminated effective immediately.",
      "\"Unfortunately, my colleague had no answers to provide me,\" Comans said.",
      "Her name went viral later that morning after conservative broadcaster Benny Johnson posted on X that Comans was \"fired for illegally funding migrant luxury hotels in NYC against the orders of President Trump.\" The post was spread by other rightwing accounts.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security sent out its press release about the firings shortly after that.",
      "\"Effective immediately, FEMA is terminating the employment of four individuals for circumventing leadership to unilaterally make egregious payments for luxury NYC hotels for migrants. Firings include FEMA's Chief Financial Officer, two program analysts and a grant specialist,\" the release said. \"Under President Trump and Secretary Noem's leadership, DHS will not sit idly and allow deep state activists to undermine the will and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Musk also shared a post about Comans, writing that her behavior was \"criminal.\"",
      "Comans said she feels betrayed by the department and agency because \"they have allowed Mr. Musk and others to slander my name, to defame me.\"",
      "\"The department has sat by idly and in some ways they have joined that choir of saying untrue statements about me,\" she said.",
      "Comans wants her name cleared and to be compensated for the damage she says has been caused. She would also take her job back if given the opportunity.",
      "\"I don't know that you can put a price on it,\" she said. \"To me, the No. 1 goal is clearing my name.\"",

      "\"During Starship's ascent burn, the vehicle experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly and contact was lost. Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses,\" SpaceX said in a statement.",
      "\"We will review the data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"Obviously, a lot to go through, a lot to dig through. We're going to go right at it,\" said SpaceX launch commentator Dan Huot. \"The primary reason we do these flight tests is to learn. We have some more to learn about this vehicle, but we're going to be right back here in the not-too-distant future, and we're going to get a ship to space.\"",

      "Launch began according to plan",
      "Three days after a last-minute scrub due to unspecified technical issues, SpaceX fired up the Super Heavy first stage's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines at 6:30 p.m. EST. Two seconds later, the tallest, most powerful rocket in the world lifted off from the company's launch site on the Texas Gulf Coast.",

      "After boosting the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere, the 230-foot-tall, 30-foot-wide Super Heavy first stage booster flew itself back to the launch site and into the grasp of two giant mechanical arms known as \"chopsticks\" mounted on the side of the launch tower.",
      "The chopsticks closed around the slowly descending booster, locking onto structural capture fixtures on both sides of the rocket. The dramatic launch pad capture, SpaceX's third, is a key element in the company's plan to enable rapid refurbishment and reuse.",

      "Trouble 8 minutes after liftoff",
      "But a little more than eight minutes after liftoff, telemetry shown on SpaceX's live webcast indicated four of the six engines had prematurely shut down. A camera on the Starship showed the spacecraft starting to spin about and several seconds later contact was lost.",
      "Multiple videos posted on social media showed a dramatic shower of debris arcing back toward Earth after the vehicle broke up. It wasn't immediately clear if the breakup was triggered by the Starship's self-destruct system or by extreme structural loads as it fell back into the lower atmosphere.",
      "While SpaceX will no doubt attempt its usual rapid recovery, the Federal Aviation Administration will almost certainly order another failure investigation. Given two destructive breakups in a row, it could take longer to return to flight status this time around.",
      "The flight plan called for a battery of tests, including the deployment of four simulated Starlink satellites to test the Starship's payload release system, the in-space restart of one of the rocket's Raptor engines and tests of new heat shield materials and components needed for the eventual pad capture of returning Starships.",
      "At the conclusion of the sub-orbital flight, the Starship was expected fall back into the atmosphere belly first. Once past the region of maximum atmospheric heating, the rocket was programmed to flip into a vertical orientation before settling to a tail-first rocket-powered \"soft landing\" in the Indian Ocean near Australia.",

      "Three minutes after that, the rocket's self-destruct system triggered an explosion that broke the Starship apart, producing a spectacular shower of flaming debris that rained down along the flight path.",
      "Telemetry indicated the fire broke out after propellant lines leading to one of the Raptors ruptured due to unexpected harmonic vibrations. SpaceX carried out a 60-second engine test firing of the Starship launched Monday, studying responses to various thrust levels.",
      "Based on the test results, propellant feed lines were modified, fuel temperatures were changed and thrust levels were adjusted to avoid any such harmonic responses. Additional vents were installed in the area where the fire broke out and a nitrogen purge system was added to minimize the chance of fire.",

The crew will transfer to the waiting Starship for the descent to the lunar surface. NASA hopes to send the first woman and the next man to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe, after an unpiloted Starship moon landing.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

      "Washington \u2014 Hampton Dellinger, the former head of the office that investigates whistleblower retaliation, has dropped his legal challenge to his firing by President Trump from his role as special counsel.",
      "Dellinger's decision to end his legal fight comes hours after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit cleared the way for Mr. Trump to terminate him as leader of the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "The D.C. Circuit granted a request from the president to halt a lower court order that blocked Dellinger's firing. The judge in that case, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, sided with the former special counsel in his challenge to his removal and said in a ruling Saturday that he must remain in the role.",
      "Dellinger's decision to walk away from the case cuts off its path to the Supreme Court, which has in a pair of recent decisions reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will.",
      "In a letter\u00a0filed Thursday, lawyers for Dellinger told the D.C. Circuit Court that he decided to no longer pursue judicial relief. They said they are still in talks with the federal government over the next steps to bring the litigation to a close, but wrote \"Dellinger's final and public decision means that there is presently no live appeal for this court to address.\"",
      "\"I'm stopping the fight because, yesterday, circuit court judges reviewing the trial court decision in my favor granted the government's request that I be removed from office while the case continues,\" Dellinger wrote in a statement obtained by CBS News. \"This new ruling means that OSC will be run by someone totally beholden to the president for the months that would pass before I could get a final decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "The ethics watchdog warned that the harm to those dependent on the agency under a future special counsel sympathetic to the Trump administration \"could be immediate, grievous, and, I fear, uncorrectable.\"",
      "\"I think the circuit judges erred badly because their willingness to sign off on my ouster \u2014 even if presented as possibly temporary \u2014 immediately erases the independence Congress provided for my position, a vital protection that has been accepted as lawful for nearly fifty years. Until now,\" Dellinger said. \"And given the circuit court's adverse ruling, I think my odds of ultimately prevailing before the Supreme Court are long.\"",
      "Dellinger continued to take numerous actions under the scope of his former role while the legal battle over his firing played out. He petitioned against the Trump administration's recent mass firings of federal workers\u00a0and, on Tuesday, argued to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the administrative system for federal workers to appeal employment issues, that the Department of Agriculture's firing of over 5,000 probationary workers violated civil service protections.",
      "Dellinger was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate in February 2024 to a five-year term. But on Feb. 7, he received an email from the head of the White House's Presidential Personnel Office informing him that \"your position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "Dellinger swiftly challenged his firing in federal district court, alleging that it was unlawful because federal law restricts his removal by the president only for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "Soon after, Jackson ordered Dellinger to be reinstated as special counsel while she considered his request for longer relief.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit and then the Supreme Court to intervene in the dispute during the earlier stages and greenlight the president's firing of Dellinger. But last month, the high court declined to immediately step into the fight and instead put off a decision while the proceedings before the district court moved forward.",
      "Then, on Saturday, Jackson ruled in favor of Dellinger and rejected the Trump administration's claim that the removal protections laid out in the Civil Service Reform Act were unconstitutional.",
      "The Justice Department again sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit, which granted its request to halt the district court's ruling while it considered the appeal.",
      "\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the unsigned order from the three-judge panel said.",
      "Dellinger's firing came as part of the president's efforts to overhaul the federal government and reduce its size and spending. Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has removed the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, and fired more than a dozen agency watchdogs, actions that have sparked legal challenges.",
      "A different federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, to be reinstated earlier this month. The Justice Department has appealed that decision to the D.C. Circuit. Another district judge on Thursday ruled Mr. Trump's firing of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox   was unlawful.",
      "Thousands of federal workers deemed probationary have been laid off after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., declined to stop the firings, and the White House personnel and budget offices have told agencies to submit \"reorganization plans\" and prepare for \"reductions in force.\"",
      "A federal judge in California last month\u00a0found that the mass terminations are likely illegal in a separate case brought by labor unions and nonprofit organizations.",

      "In a 36-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who sits on the U.S. District Court in Washington, said that the Constitution and past decisions make clear that Congress can limit the president's removal power. She ruled that the president's firing of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB violated federal law that allows for a board member to be removed only for \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" and declared her termination void.",
      "\"Under our constitutional system, such checks, by design, guard against executive overreach and the risk such overreach would pose of autocracy,\" Howell wrote in a 36-page decision. \"An American president is not a king \u2014 not even an 'elected' one \u2014 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here.\"",
      "Howell, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote that Mr. Trump \"seems intent on pushing the bounds of his office and exercising his power in a manner violative of clear statutory law to test how much the courts will accept the notion of a presidency that is supreme.\"",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "But soon after returning to a second term in the White House, Mr. Trump replaced Wilcox as chair and fired her from her position on the board in late January. While the National Labor Relations Act requires the president to remove a member \"upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office,\" the email sent to Wilcox on behalf of the president stated that she and another board member have not \"been operating in a manner consistent with the objectives of my administration.\"",
      "Wilcox told CBS News last month that she was \"stunned\" when she received a letter from the White House firing her.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, said. She swiftly challenged her firing in federal court.",
      "In her decision, the judge noted that in the 90 years since the NLRB was founded, the president has never removed a member of its board.",
      "\"His attempt to do so here is blatantly illegal, and his constitutional arguments to excuse this illegal act are contrary to Supreme Court precedent and over a century of practice,\" she said.",
      "The court found that a Supreme Court decision from 1935 binds the outcome of Wilcox's case. That case carved out an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers. The Supreme Court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "\"The 150-year history and tradition of multimember boards or commissions and 90-year precedent from the Supreme Court approving of removal protections for their officers dictates the same outcome for the NLRB here,\" Howell wrote.",
      "She added that \"nothing in the Constitution or the historical development of the removal power has suggested the president's removal power is absolute.\"",
      "\"The president does not have the authority to terminate members of the National Labor Relations Board at will, and his attempt to fire plaintiff from her position on the Board was a blatant violation of the law,\" the judge found.",
      "Howell criticized Mr. Trump for portraying himself as a king \u2014 pointing to a social media post from the White House last month that featured an illustration of the president wearing a crown, along with the headline \"long live the king\" \u2014 and said that he misunderstands the role of Article II of the Constitution, which lays out the scope of the president's powers.",
      "\"At issue in this case, is the president's insistence that he has authority to fire whomever he wants within the Executive branch, overriding any congressionally mandated law in his way,\" she wrote. \"Luckily, the Framers, anticipating such a power grab, vested in Article III, not Article II, the power to interpret the law, including resolving conflicts about congressional checks on presidential authority. The president's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power \u2014 or, more aptly, his aspiration \u2014 is flat wrong.\"",
      "The decision from Howell sets the case on a path to the Supreme Court and could lead it to overturn the 1935 decision in the case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. Sarah Harris, the acting solicitor general, wrote in a letter to Congress last month that the Trump administration believes that certain for-cause removal restrictions for multi-member commissions are unconstitutional and would urge the Supreme Court to overturn its precedent.",
      "The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years chipped away at that 90-year-old ruling and reasserted the president's power to remove executive branch officers at will. Most notably in 2020, the\u00a0Supreme Court ruled\u00a0that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure of a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance was unconstitutional.",

    "story": [
      "Federal health agencies oppose the use of bird flu vaccines in poultry right now, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said, weighing in publicly on it for the first time in his new role. The Trump administration has been considering poultry vaccination as it seeks to combat the outbreak that is fueling a record surge in egg prices.",
      "U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said last month that they were ramping up planning on potentially deploying a vaccine for poultry, with the hopes of putting a draft of the plan before trading partners \"as quickly as possible,\" since it could affect billions of dollars in exports.",
      "\"There's no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity and all three of my health agencies, NIH, CDC, and FDA, the acting heads of those agencies have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News published this week.",
      "Sterilizing immunity means vaccine protection that completely stops infections and spread. Vaccines are rarely able to offer this kind of effectiveness, though the USDA said last month it would step up investments in \"potential new generation vaccines\" with better protection.",
      "Kennedy's remarks mark a sharp turn from the Biden administration, multiple former officials said.",
      "Biden officials from the health and agriculture departments had wrestled extensively with calls to roll out vaccines for animals as outbreaks mounted on farms nationwide. It was concerns from agriculture officials, not human health officials, that ultimately blocked plans to roll out vaccines.",
      "\"At no point did they express a concern or anything other than robust support for an animal vaccination program,\" one former USDA official said of the health agencies.",
      "At the time, Biden-era health officials viewed the ultimate decision as one outside of their expertise and better left to agriculture department experts, two people familiar with the planning said.",
      "Would vaccinating poultry turn birds into \"mutant factories\"?",
      "Kennedy said the new opposition from his health agencies was based on concerns that vaccinating poultry without being able to provide sterilizing immunity would amount to \"turning those birds into mutant factories,\" resulting in worrying genetic changes to the virus.",
      "\"That could actually accelerate the jump to human beings,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Experts say vaccination would need to be managed with strict biosecurity measures \u2014 extra precautions to prevent vaccinated birds from becoming infected \u2014 to reduce the risk of genetic changes in the virus.",
      "\"Creating conditions where the virus can freely mutate increases the likelihood of a strain emerging that can infect humans,\" said Daniel Perez, chair in poultry medicine at the University of Georgia, in an email.",
      "Perez said the risk is higher in large-scale poultry operations, where birds can have weaker immune systems.",
      "But he added that he sees vaccination as a strategic option to curb outbreaks for egg-laying chickens and backyard poultry, alongside other measures like intensive surveillance to detect outbreaks and continued culling of infected flocks of chickens raised for meat.",
      "\"Vaccination can be a useful tool when combined with strict biosecurity. If birds are kept from exposure to the virus, then vaccination can help to contain outbreaks,\" said Perez.",
      "Instead, Perez warned that another idea floated by Trump administration officials could pose a far greater risk: relying on immunity from poultry surviving bird flu infections.",
      "\"We've in fact said, at the USDA, that they should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds and preserve the birds that are immune to it,\" Kennedy had said.",
      "Perez said this approach would make surviving birds breeding grounds for worrying mutations.",

    "story": [
      "Health care is so expensive that 31 million U.S. adults, or 12%, had to borrow a total of $74 billion last year to obtain medical care, new data shows. That includes people with health insurance, making such numbers even more troubling.",
      "Almost one-third of the more than 3,500 people surveyed by Gallup and West Health, a group of nonprofit health care organizations, said they're \"very concerned\" that a major health event would lead to medical debt despite most of them having some form of health care coverage.",
      "The survey results underscore how exposed individuals and families can be to financial hardship just to pay for essential health care services.",
      "\"What's very visible here is families are forced to take out loans and borrow to cover expensive care that is needed,\" Tim Lash, president of West Health, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These big numbers are concerning, but the humanity is lost in the billions and trillions as we reduce this down to what the lived experience is of the American individual and families.\"",
      "To avoid taking on debt, families sometimes make tradeoffs, such as purchasing fewer groceries or not paying rent in order to get the care they need, Lash added.",
      "Nearly one in five adults between the ages of 18 and 28 reported borrowing money to pay for health care, according to the survey. Only 9% of Americans between 50 and 64 and 2% of those 65 or older reported having to borrow money to obtain needed medical care.",
      "\"There are a lot of disparities in terms of who borrows,\" Lash said. That's in part because Medicare, which is available to people who are 65 or older, provides enrollees with relatively comprehensive coverage.",
      "As of mid-2024, U.S. residents owed at least $220 billion in medical debt, according to data from the American Hospital Association. Health care bills have for years been a leading cause of personal bankruptcies.",

      "The station wagon believed to belong to Ken and Barbara Martin was found last fall by Archer Mayo, a diver who had been looking for the car for seven years, said Mayo's representative, Ian Costello. Mayo pinpointed the likely location and dove several times before finding the car upside down about 50 feet deep, covered in mud, salmon guts, silt and mussel shells, he said.",

The bodies of two daughters were found the following year near the Bonneville Dam, but the rest of the family was never located.",
      "The incident was deemed an accident but the discovery of a damaged gun floating to the surface raised questions.",

After Mayo provided part of the license plate number and other vehicle identifiers, the sheriff's office and the Columbia Gorge major crimes team, along with the Oregon State Crime Lab, arranged to have the car pulled out, he said.",
      "\"We're not 100% sure it's the car,\" Hughes said. \"It's mostly encased in mud and debris, so we don't know what to expect when we pull it out of the water today.\"",
      "Mayo runs a business that finds things that were lost in the river, like watches and rings, but also helps with the recovery of drowning victims, Costello said. He had been looking for a research vessel that sank in 2017 when he learned about the Martin family, Costello said.",
      "Mayo began digging up material on the family and used modeling to pinpoint the possible location, he said. Mayo found other cars nearby, which will need to come out before the construction company pulls out the station wagon and authorities get answers to a 66-year-old mystery, Costello said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0An\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was sent to lawmakers this week showed that budget goals outlined in a House GOP plan could not be reached without reducing spending on Medicaid, clashing with commitments from Republicans not to cut the popular entitlement program.",
      "House Republicans adopted a budget proposal last week that serves as a blueprint for implementing President Trump's agenda. The resolution must be adopted by the Senate before the chambers can move forward with the budget reconciliation process, a complicated maneuver that allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But opponents of the resolution have warned that the proposed cuts implicate key programs that Americans rely on, concerns that the CBO analysis backed up.",
      "Republicans want to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending over a 10-year period to pay for trillions in tax cuts, while increasing funding in some areas. The budget resolution directs congressional committees to craft their own proposals to hit spending targets, increasing or decreasing funding by adjusting programs and policies that fall under their purview.",
      "The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicaid, is tasked with finding at least $880 billion in cuts over the next decade. A pair of House Democrats asked the CBO for the projected mandatory spending on programs under the committee's jurisdiction, excluding Medicare, which offers health coverage for seniors. Medicaid provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans, with costs split between the federal government and the states.",
      "CBO found that Medicaid accounts for 93% of all remaining non-Medicare mandatory spending, with $581 billion going to other programs. That means the committee couldn't meet its $880 billion target without touching the program. GOP leaders have not proposed cutting Medicare, leaving Medicaid as the source of potential cuts.",
      "House Republican leaders have stressed that Medicaid isn't specifically mentioned in the budget resolution and said benefits would not be cut, noting that last week's vote was merely to begin the reconciliation process. But Republicans have said they plan to remove \"fraud, waste and abuse\" within the program, and many members support work requirements that could limit eligibility for benefits. Other GOP lawmakers have expressed concerns about making cuts to the program, since many of their constituents and voters rely on coverage.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the CBO findings \"confirmed what we have long understood to be the case with the reckless Republican budget.\"",
      "\"Republicans are trying to rip healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,\" the New York Democrat said, pledging that \"every single Democrat\" will stand against the House plan.",

The call from Zelenskyy to halt aerial bombardments on energy facilities builds on growing rhetoric from Kyiv, Washington and Moscow on halting the war just over three years after it was sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said the first steps to establishing real peace should be stopping both Russian and Ukrainian aerial and naval attacks.

      "Both the South Korean and U.S. militaries halted all live-fire exercises across South Korea. Military officials said South Korea's air force also stopped the flights of all its aircraft except surveillance planes and others needed for emergency situations.",
      "Military officials said the Freedom Shield training will proceed as scheduled and they plan to restart live-fire and flight training after they find the exact cause of the bombing and formulate preventative steps.",
      "But if they fail to resume the paused training by Monday, when they kick off the Freedom Shield exercise with the U.S. military, that would hurt the workings of the early parts of the exercise, observers say.",
      "Possible issues with U.S.-South Korean joint exercises",
      "Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said the suspension of flight training would particularly cause \"really a big problem in examining the two countries' operational plans.\" He said flying warplanes would be essential to determining their actual capabilities, discussing the size of reinforcements of U.S. aircraft from abroad and modifying the allies' operational plans.",
      "Initial investigations found the pilot of one of the KF-16s entered wrong coordinates for a bombing site. Officials said the pilots of the two jets had more than 200-400 hours of flying time. But Lee said they likely piloted KF-16s only two to three years.",
      "The South Korean and U.S. militaries have already begun field exercises in connection with the Freedom Shield, and Thursday's live-fire drill was one of them. Col. Ryan Donald, spokesperson for the U.S. military in South Korea, confirmed that American servicemembers were participating in Thursday's live-fire training but said no U.S. air force aircraft were still involved.",
      "\"We take this incident very seriously. We are coordinating closely with the ROK Ministry of Defense and are committed to a thorough and transparent investigation,\" Donald said in a statement, using the acronym of South Korea's official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "The incident happened as North Korea was ramping up its fiery rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea, as it views their joint drills as invasion rehearsals. North Korea's state news agency warned Friday that the U.S. and South Korea \"will have to pay dearly for their stupid and reckless war drills.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said he would reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomacy, but Pyongyang hasn't responded to any overtures he might have made.",
      "In Seoul, there were concerns that Mr. Trump might scale back U.S.-South Korean military drills because during his first term, he complained about the cost of bilateral exercises and once unilaterally announced the cancellation of one drill after his first summit with Kim.",
      "But Lee said Mr. Trump now knows the importance of South Korea in America's Indo-Pacific and China policies and won't downsize drills with South Korea.",
      "This year's field training being held alongside the Freedom Shield involves 16 brigade-level field trainings, up from 10 such drills last year, according to South Korea's military.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 A South Korean court on Friday ordered impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol released from jail, more than a month after he was arrested and indicted over his short-lived imposition of martial law.",
      "The decision by the Seoul Central District Court would allow Yoon stand trial while not being physically detained. The hearings in his separate impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court concluded in late February and the court is expected to rule soon on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said it accepted Yoon's request to be released from jail because the legal period of his formal arrest expired before he was indicted in late January. The court said the investigative agency that detained Yoon before his formal arrest didn't have legal rights to investigate the criminal rebellion charges.",
      "Yoon's defense team welcomed the court's decision and urged prosecutors to release him immediately. The presidential office also welcomed the court's decision, saying it hopes Yoon will swiftly return to work.",
      "However, South Korea law allows prosecutors to hold a suspect temporarily while they pursue an appeal.",
      "Yoon's lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, told Agence France-Presse Yoon \"will be released only if the prosecutor waives the right to appeal or does not file an appeal within the prescribed period.\"",
      "Prosecutors didn't immediately respond when AFP requested a comment.",
      "Investigators have alleged that the martial-law decree amounted to rebellion. If he's convicted of that offense, he would face the death penalty or life imprisonment.",
      "Yoon's martial law decree, which involved the dispatch of troops and police forces to the National Assembly, evoked traumatic memories of past military rules among many South Koreans. The decree lasted only six hours as enough lawmakers managed to get into an assembly hall to allow a vote and then voted unanimously to overturn it.",
      "Yoon later argued his decree was only meant to inform the people of the danger of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which undermined his agenda and impeached top officials, and said he dispatched troops to the assembly only in order to maintain order. But some top military and police officers sent to the assembly have told Constitutional Court hearings or investigators that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to obstruct a vote on his decree or detain politicians.",
      "If the Constitutional Court upholds Yoon's impeachment, he would be officially thrown out of office and a national election would be held to choose his successor within two months.",
      "Massive rallies by opponents and supporters of Yoon have filled the streets of Seoul and other major South Korean cities. Whatever the Constitutional Court decides, experts say it will likely further polarize the country and intensify its conservative-liberal divide.",
      "Yoon is the first South Korean president to be arrested while in office. South Korean law gives a president immunity from most criminal prosecution, but not for grave charges like rebellion or treason.",
      "By law, a president in South Korea has the power to put the country under martial law in wartime and similar emergency situations, but many experts say South Korea wasn't in such conditions when Yoon declared martial law.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:59:31 -0500",
    "summary": "As Russia bombs Ukraine and Trump pushes Zelenskyy for a \"better deal,\" what will it take to end the war Vladimir Putin started?",
    "story": [
      "The CIA chief confirmed Wednesday that the Trump administration had paused not only the flow of military hardware and financial support to Ukraine, but also vital intelligence gathering that has helped Kyiv anticipate and block incoming missile and drone attacks and effectively target Russia's invading forces. The U.S. military's European Command has also said shipments of arms that were already on their way \u2014 approved by the Biden administration but not yet delivered \u2014 have been paused.",
      "The pause is part of President Trump's abrupt shift in policy on Ukraine, which has seen the White House adopt rhetoric closely aligned with Russia's narrative justifying the three-year war on its smaller neighbor, and Mr. Trump's bid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a ceasefire deal that could involve significant concessions by Kyiv.",
      "Speaking Thursday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in Washington moderated by CBS News' Margaret Brennan, Mr. Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine Keith Kellogg defended the intelligence cutoff as a necessary wake up call to Kyiv of the White House's determination to forge a peace deal.",
      "\"The best way I can describe it is like hitting a mule with a two-by-four across their noses \u2014 we got their attention,\" he said. \"But it's a pause, it's not an end. It's then up to them.\"",
      "Kellogg did not play down the severity of the measure, but said it would not have taken Kyiv by surprise, as \"they were warned this was coming. I told them.\"",
      "\"If you take away support like that, of course it's important,\" said Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Army, adding: \"But that's why it was done.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said Vladimir Putin will also have to make concessions to bring about a ceasefire, but those have not been outlined by the White House to date. To even engage in real negotiations on a potential ceasefire agreement, Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants Zelenskyy to first give the U.S. access to a major share of Ukraine's mineral resources.",
      "Why Ukraine says security guarantees are essential",
      "Zelenskyy's reluctance to sign an economic deal thus far, without clear guarantees that it would come with a commitment from the U.S. to help defend Ukraine from further Russian attack, appeared to enrage Mr. Trump during their\u00a0chaotic Oval Office meeting on Friday. The White House has repeatedly suggested that American business investment in Ukraine, with U.S. workers on the ground, would, by default, shield the country from Russian aggression, and Mr. Trump has said himself that he trusts Russia to keep any promises it makes.",
      "Ukraine and America's European allies do not trust Putin's Russia. They note that as the Biden administration warned of Russia's looming invasion at the beginning of 2022, top officials in Moscow insisted repeatedly that they had no such intentions.",
      "\"I am certain that there is no risk of a large-scale war. \u2026 We do not intend to take any aggressive actions. We will not attack, raid or invade Ukraine,\" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said about a month before Putin ordered the full-scale invasion, sparking the bloodiest conflict on European soil since World War II.",
      "Given that recent history, Ukraine's former Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News on Wednesday that any talk of a ceasefire with Russia now, without clear security guarantees from the West, would only give Putin time to regroup and rearm his strained military, and then to reinvade.",
      "Could a Ukrainian \"goodwill gesture\" get Trump on board?",
      "\"We are interested in peace, but we are definitely interested in something that would be guaranteed as a peace, and that would not be used by the Russian Federation as a pause to remobilize and to attack with a tsunami wave over Ukraine and also over European countries,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "After Zelenskyy's dressing-down at the White House, Ukrainian officials \u2014 including Zelenskyy himself \u2014 made it clear they were\u00a0still willing to sign an economic agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"I think the only thing that that deal is potentially going to give us is a discussion on another deal,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, suggesting the economic agreement could serve as a framework, \"and the possibility to engage the United States. \u2026 It's a goodwill gesture with hope that it would translate into the U.S. standing with good against the evil.\"",
      "Russia, Europeans stress, has shown no willingness so far to bend on any of its maximalist demands that Ukraine cede the roughly 20% of its territory currently occupied by Putin's forces. The Kremlin has repeatedly ruled out agreeing to any European peacekeeping forces helping maintain a truce.",
      "Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue",
      "Far from any signs of d\u00e9tente, Russian missiles, bombs and explosive drones have continued falling on Ukraine.",
      "Overnight, the attacks intensified. The eastern city of Krivy Rih, President Zelenskyy's hometown, was targeted by a Russian ballistic missile. In a post on social media,\u00a0Zelenskyy said among the damaged buildings was a hotel full of aid workers, including some U.S. and British volunteers. At least 30 people were injured in the attack and four killed, Zelenskyy said, adding that none of those killed were from the U.S. or U.K.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I do not see the readiness of the Russian Federation to really engage,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze said, noting that \"every single night\" Ukraine has faced Russian bombardment. \"That is not something that is showing goodwill of terminating these attacks.\"",
      "What Ukraine wants, what Russia wants",
      "Klympush-Tsintsadze said she hoped an agreement with the Trump administration on minerals \"would give us the possibility, hopefully, to come to a real peace settlement,\" but she cautioned that \"a peace settlement that would not have security provisions on the side of our partners would barely hold with the Russian Federation.\"",
      "\"We've been there before,\" she said, stressing that when Russia first attacked her country 11 years ago, sending in forces to seize the Crimean Peninsula while denying their presence, Moscow claimed it was because \"NATO is expanding,\" but she said at the time Ukraine was \"a totally neutral and non-aligned, non-block country.\"",
      "\"And then all the other lies that the Russian Federation has been coming up with against the Ukrainian people, just because they don't want us to exist. They just want to exterminate us as a nation and as a country, and that's their goal. So, in order for us to reach peace, we would have to see the way to that peace settlement \u2014 which definitely comes through a ceasefire, but not necessarily ends with a ceasefire.\"",
      "Moscow has defended its aggression against Ukraine for more than a decade as a justified reaction to the U.S.-led NATO alliance's territory inching toward Russia's western border. That expansion began in the wake of the communist Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, with former Soviet bloc republics choosing to join the Western alliance to ensure their own security.",
      "Ukraine has expressed interest in joining the NATO alliance for over 20 years, and it has cooperated with NATO as a neutral partner for about that long, but it was not given a clear\u00a0path to membership \u2014 largely due to many members worrying it would be seen as a provocation by Russia \u2014 until after Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "In 2023, with the war well underway, then-President Biden said he didn't believe Ukraine was \"ready for membership in NATO,\" adding that he didn't see unanimity among the alliance's members \"about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\"",
      "President Trump's administration has\u00a0ruled out Ukraine joining the alliance and launched unilateral negotiations with Russia. That direct Washington-Moscow dialogue and the lack of any clear demands by Mr. Trump for concessions from Putin have stoked fears in Kyiv and Western European capitals about the White House's commitment to both the NATO alliance and to securing a ceasefire in Ukraine that looks like anything other than humiliation and capitulation for pro-Western Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia insists it wants to end the war it started in Ukraine, and Mr. Trump has said he believes Moscow on that point. Speaking Thursday to reporters in Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov doubled down on the Russian narrative, pushed since Mr. Trump engaged in talks with Putin, that Europe, to a greater degree than Washington, is to blame for the conflict's enduring nature.",
      "Peskov said that while the U.S. under Mr. Trump \"is not a friendly country to us at the moment, the United States is a country with which we are now trying to revive and restore our bilateral relations.\"",
      "That is not the case, he made clear, of America's NATO allies in Europe.",
      "Ukraine seeks Europe's support, but hopes the \"United States will stand for democracy\"",
      "Peskov cited remarks by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who called Wednesday for Europe to boost its collective military capabilities and assume more responsibility for the continent's defense \u2014 as President Trump has demanded \u2014 as evidence that \"France is really looking for a continuation of the war.\" He said Macron had suggested that \"France is ready to use its nuclear weapons for security purposes and so on,\" claiming the French leader had issued \"a claim to nuclear leadership in Europe, that is, it is very, very confrontational.\"",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called Macron's remarks \"a threat to Russia,\" while dismissing European suggestions that it is in fact Russia which poses a threat to security on the continent, calling that \"stupid\" and \"delirious nonsense.\"",
      "Macron did reference atomic weapons in his Wednesday night address, saying France's \"deterrent capabilities\" had helped to protect the country \"much more than many of our neighbors\" who do not possess such weapons. He did not mention plans to bolster France's nuclear deterrent specifically, but said that as the Trump administration signals less willingness to come to its European allies' defense, he would consider requests from nations such as Germany to extend \"the protection of our allies on the European continent by our deterrent.\"",
      "As Europe grapples over how to ensure its own defense from future Russian or other threats, Ukrainians will be hoping the continent's leaders move quickly to boost their own defenses against Russia's current, ongoing assault.",
      "France was quick to confirm it would continue sharing its intelligence with Ukraine after the U.S. cutoff, with Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu saying: \"Our intelligence is sovereign. We have intelligence that we allow Ukraine to benefit from.\"",
      "\"We are hoping that all the great... warm political will of the European nations will also, as urgently as possible, will translate in upscaling their defense engagement with Ukraine,\" Klympush-Tsintsadze told CBS News. \"They've given a lot. They have much more limited capacities than the United States, but we hope that they will be able to invest in Ukrainian defense capacities, that they will be able to upscale their defense production, that they will help us also to procure weaponry in order for us to stay strong while Russia has not given up on their plans to just destroy us.\"",
      "She made it clear that Ukraine would also continue working toward an agreement with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We are to try to get the message across to the American public. I think that this is also very important, and I'm sure that President Trump really cares about the support that he enjoys back in the United States, and I hope that he hears also his citizens [saying] why this is important, and why it is expected that the United States will stand for democracy, will stand for freedoms.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump issued a \"last warning\" to Hamas to release all hostages it still holds even as the White House confirmed unprecedented direct U.S.-Hamas talks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump issued what he called a \"last warning\" to the terrorist group Hamas Wednesday to release all hostages still held in Gaza, directing a sharply worded message after the White House confirmed that he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the group. Mr. Trump, in a statement on his Truth social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was \"sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.\"",
      "\"Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" he said. \"Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!\"",
      "Mr. Trump ended his post with a message he addressed \"directly to the People of Gaza,\" many of whom do not support Hamas, saying: \"A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\"",
      "Hamas said Thursday that the Trump threats \"encourage\" Israel to disregard the ceasefire's terms.",
      "\"These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms,\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said in a statement.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to \"open the gates of hell\" if Hamas doesn't\u00a0return all its hostages.",
      "The pointed language from the president came after the White House said Wednesday that U.S. officials have engaged in \"ongoing talks and discussions\" with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with any U.S.-designated terrorist groups. It's the first known direct engagement between the U.S. and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.",
      "Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha came as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire hangs in the balance.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to provide details on the substance of talks, but said Mr. Trump has authorized his envoys to \"talk to anyone.\"",
      "\"Look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what's in the best interest of the American people is something that the president ... believes is a good-faith effort to do what's right for the American people,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt added that Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, and noted that there are \"American lives at stake.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office offered a terse acknowledgement of the U.S.-Hamas talks. \"Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas,\" the prime minister's office said.",
      "Egyptian and Qatari intermediaries have been serving as mediators with Hamas.",
      "Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages \u2014 including Edan Alexander, an American citizen \u2014 as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza.",
      "Adam Boehler, Mr. Trump's nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, led the direct talks with Hamas. Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a health care investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Mr. Trump's first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world.",
      "The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who wasn't authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The official added that no progress was made but \"the step itself is promising\" and more talks are expected. Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped arrange the talks.",
      "The direct engagement comes as continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. Mr. Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn't agree to terms of a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages \u2014 the terrorist group's main bargaining chip \u2014 in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners, a key component of the first phase, which expired Saturday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday welcomed eight former hostages \u2014 Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, Eli Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama Levy, Doron Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani \u2014 to the White House.",
      "\"The President listened intently to their heartbreaking stories,\" Leavitt said. \"The hostages thanked President Trump for his steadfast efforts to bring all of the hostages home.\"",

      "The air force said it will establish a committee to investigate why the accident happened and examine the scale of the civilian damage. It said the fighter jets were taking part in the air force's joint live-fire drills with the army.",
      "The incident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "An unidentified air force official told local reporters a pilot of one of the KF-16s put in a wrong coordinate for a bombing site.

    "story": [
      "Takamatsu Gushiken turns on a headlamp and enters a cave buried in Okinawa's jungle. He gently runs his fingers through the gravel until two pieces of bone emerge. These are from the skulls, he says, of an infant and possibly an adult.",
      "He carefully places them in a ceramic rice bowl and takes a moment to imagine people dying 80 years ago as they hid in this cave during one of the fiercest battles of World War II. His hope is that the dead can be reunited with their families.",
      "The remains of some 1,400 people found on Okinawa sit in storage for possible identification with DNA testing. So far just six have been identified and returned to their families. Volunteer bone hunters and families looking for their loved ones say the government should do more to help.",
      "Gushiken says the bones are silent witnesses to Okinawa's wartime tragedy, carrying a warning to the present generation as Japan ups its defense spending in the face of tensions with China over territorial disputes and Beijing's claim to the nearby self-governing island Taiwan.",
      "\"The best way to honor the war dead is never to allow another war,\" Gushiken says. \"I'm worried about Okinawa's situation now. ... I'm afraid there is a growing risk that Okinawa may become a battlefield again.\"",
      "Island haunted by one of World War II's deadliest battles",
      "On April 1, 1945, U.S. troops landed on Okinawa during their push toward mainland Japan, beginning a battle that lasted until late June and killed about 12,000 Americans and more than 188,000 Japanese, half of them Okinawan civilians. That included students and victims of mass suicides ordered by the Japanese military, historians say.",
      "The fighting ended at Itoman, where Gushiken and other volunteer cave diggers \u2014 or \"gamahuya\" in their native Okinawan language \u2014 have found the remains of what are likely hundreds of people.",
      "Gushiken tries to imagine being in the cave during the fighting. Where would he hide? What would he feel? He makes a guess about the age of the victims, whether they died by gunshot or explosion, and puts details about the bones in a small red notebook.",
      "After the war, Okinawa remained under U.S. occupation until 1972, 20 years longer than most of Japan, and it remains host to a major U.S. military presence to this day. As Japan enjoyed a postwar economic rise, Okinawa's economic, educational and social development lagged behind.",
      "Gushiken says when he was a child growing up in Okinawa's capital, Naha, he would go out hunting bugs and find skulls still wearing helmets.",
      "A slow search for remains",
      "Nearly 80 years after the end of World War II, 1.2 million Japanese war dead are still unaccounted for. That's about half of the 2.4 million Japanese, mostly soldiers, who died during Japan's early 20th century wars.",
      "Thousands of unidentified bones have been sitting in storage for years waiting for testing that could help match them with surviving families.",
      "Gushiken says the government's DNA matching efforts have been too little and too slow.",
      "Of the estimated 188,140 Japanese killed in the Battle of Okinawa, most of their remains had been collected and placed in the national cemetery on the island, the health ministry says. Around 1,400 remains found in recent decades sit in storage. The process of identification has been painfully slow.",
      "It was only in 2003 that the Japanese government started DNA matching after requests from the families of the dead, but tests were limited to the remains found with teeth and manmade artifacts that could provide hints to their identities.",
      "In 2016, Japan enacted a law launching a remains recovery initiative to promote more DNA matching and cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense. A lear later, the government expanded the work to civilians and authorized testing on limb bones.",
      "In all, 1,280 remains of Japanese war-dead, including six on Okinawa, have been identified by DNA tests since 2003, the health ministry said. The remains of around 14,000 people are stored in the ministry mortuary for future testing.",
      "Hundreds of American soldiers remain unaccounted for. Their remains, as well as those of the Koreans mobilized by the Japanese during the war, may yet be found, Gushiken says.",
      "Locating and identifying decades-old remains have become increasingly difficult as families and relatives age, memories fade, artifacts and documents get lost, and the remains deteriorate, says Naoki Tezuka, a health ministry official.",
      "\"The progress has been slow everywhere,\" Tezuka said. \"Ideally, we hope to not just collect the remains but return them to their families.\"",
      "The burden of history",
      "Japan is undertaking an accelerating military buildup, sending more troops and weapons to Okinawa and its outer islands. Many here who have bitter memories of the Japanese army's wartime brutality view the current military buildup with wariness.",
      "Washington and Tokyo see the strong U.S. military presence as a crucial bulwark against China and North Korea, but many Okinawans have long complained about noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops.",
      "Okinawa today is home to more than half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan, with the majority of U.S. military facilities on the small southern island. Tokyo has promised to relocate a U.S. Marine Corps air station that sits in a crowded town after years of friction, but Okinawans remain angry at a plan that would only move it to the island's east coast and may use the soil possibly containing the remains for construction.",
      "Gushiken says the Itoman caves should be protected from development so that younger generations can learn about the war's history, and so searchers like him can complete their work.",
      "Like him, some Okinawans say they fear the lessons of their wartime suffering are being forgotten.",
      "Tomoyuki Kobashigawa's half-sister Michiko was killed soon after she got married. He wants to apply for DNA matching to help find her. \"It's so sad ... If she would have lived, we could have been such good siblings.\"",

      "\"In my family, the word 'mountain' was always forbidden. My mother wants nothing to do with the discovery of this backpack. It's a family that has been broken by grief, by the void,\" Azul, who was just 4 years old when her father died, told AFP.",
      "\"It all seemed crazy to me, and I didn't want to go back to the volcano where he had died. But as the months went by... I started to loosen up, and began thinking: 'Why not?'\"",
      "Inside the backpack, the women found a jacket, a sleeping bag, a water bottle, aspirin, Vitamin C tablets, a set of knives and two rolls of film that had belonged to their father.",

So, it was like rediscovering his story, like saying, wait... we have a father who had a life, a history. So it was like discovering him all over again.\"",
      "Photos taken from other film found inside the same backpack by Cavallaro a year earlier, showed that Vieiro and his partner Leonardo Rabal, 20, had been the first climbers to reach the top of Tupungato from its eastern side \u2014 the most challenging route.",
      "\"That slope has never been scaled again,\" Cavallaro, who lives at the foot of Tupungato in the city of the same name, told AFP.",
      "\"What they (Vieiro and Rabal) accomplished has real historical value in Argentine and international mountaineering,\" she added.",

      "\"Becoming a dad and concern for my daughter and one of the issues surrounding biological males being allowed in restrooms and locker rooms and girls private spaces, and then biological males competing against girls in sports, that's when it hit home for me,\" Daniels said about his decision to run. \"I have a five-year-old daughter who loves to play sports. I fully anticipate she's going to be an athlete, and I just want to pave a way for her to make sure that she's safe and that covers all other little girls in America.\"",

And then we're obviously going to focus on all the new revelations that are coming out with the DOGE effort to uncover the government waste, fraud and abuse. And we're going to try to hold whoever is responsible for that accountable.\"",

      "\"There was a study that came out from the Congressional Management Foundation that found that 90% of voters want their representatives to be focused on policy and not social media, essentially on doing the job and not grandstanding for the cameras and that translates over into TX-30,\" Daniels said.",
      "\"People want a representative in 2025 that's going to provide tangible and effective change that they can see in their community. Gone are the days where we just elect someone out of TX-30 and set it and forget it, and we don't hear about them again until they're getting ready to retire.\"",

While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "7. Don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources: Whatever you do, don\u2019t respond to texts/calls from unknown sources whatsoever.",

      "What is vishing?",
      "Vishing, short for \"voice phishing,\" is a type of cybercrime that uses phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",
      "Because vishing relies heavily on social engineering tactics, it can be difficult to detect, making it a particularly dangerous form of cybercrime.",

      "Scammers start by identifying potential victims through social media, public transaction records, leaked databases, and more. Once they select a target, they gather personal details (email, phone number, financial holdings) to build credibility. And you could easily be a target. That\u2019s because\u00a0data brokers \u2013 companies that buy and sell your personal information \u2013 are goldmines for scammers.

I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Secure devices:\u00a0Ensure your devices are secured with\u00a0screen locks or biometric authentication and keep\u00a0software up to date to prevent malware attacks.",

      "7. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install and regularly update strong antivirus software to protect your devices from malware, viruses and other cyber threats. Antivirus software provides real-time protection, scans for malicious files and helps prevent infections by blocking access to harmful websites and downloads.

These vishing schemes, carefully orchestrated like a theatrical play, exploit our trust and leverage real security alerts to gain access to our accounts. Protecting ourselves requires constant awareness, skepticism towards unsolicited communications, and proactive measures to safeguard our personal information. While the tactics may evolve, the underlying principle remains the same: scammers rely on deception to exploit our vulnerabilities.

      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Task scams made up a staggering 40% of all job scams reported to the FTC in 2024.",

Anyone can easily find your phone number, name, address or date of birth online. All of this data, and much more, is publicly listed on\u00a0people search sites. People search sites, or public data brokers, display your data to anyone who\u2019s interested, including marketing companies and scammers building their next job scam campaign.",

      "However, many will happily sell a list of potential targets to the highest bidder, and your name is likely on this list already. Data brokers aside, a lot of us voluntarily give up personal information on all sorts of forms, forums, blogs and\u00a0social media accounts. Since the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive federal law protecting personal data, anything that you publish online may eventually be shared and sold without your consent.",

      "1. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Consider using data removal services that help remove your personal information from people search sites and data brokers. These services can reduce your online exposure and minimize the risk of scammers finding your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Verify the legitimacy of online tasks: Research unfamiliar platforms before completing tasks. Be suspicious of requests to use your own money or cryptocurrency. A legitimate potential employer will never ask you to pay for work opportunities.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

If someone asks you to invest money to earn more, it's likely a scam. Returning to work in retirement can be a fantastic way to boost your income and stay socially connected.

      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data.

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

      "Think about it \u2014 a highly advanced prosthetic hand is only as good as the user's ability to control it. If the control system is clunky or difficult to learn, it limits the prosthetic's effectiveness and ultimately impacts the user's quality of life. Most commercially available robotic limbs still struggle with this issue.",

      "Decoding the body's natural hand movements",
      "So, how does it work? Let's break it down. When we perform everyday tasks, our fingers move in coordinated patterns called \"postural synergies.\" These synergies are fundamental to how we grasp and manipulate objects. The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make. This information is then used to control the prosthetic hand.",

      "Soft materials, smart design",
      "The hand itself is an impressive feat of engineering, combining soft materials for the skin, tendons and ligaments with rigid materials for the \"bones.\" According to Bicchi, the artificial bones \"roll on top of each other, instead of turning around pins such as robot hands normally do.\" This, along with the tendon arrangement, allows the hand to adapt to the shape of objects, mimicking the natural, intelligent grasping behavior of a human hand. One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation. This means users can not only grasp an object but also adjust their grip and move the object within their hand \u2014 imagine being able to open a water bottle using only your prosthetic hand.",

The results were encouraging, showing that the hand allowed users to perform complex movements and manipulate objects with greater precision and naturalness compared to other prosthetic hands. The tests showed that combined neural and postural synergies allowed accurate and natural control of coordinated multidigit actions, achieving over 90% of the continuous mechanical manifold, and the target hit rate for specific hand postures was higher with neural synergies compared with muscle synergies.",

      "\"Bryan C. Kohberger, by and through his attorneys of record\u2026 hereby moves this Court to strike the death penalty as a sentencing option in his case because Mr. Kohberger\u2019s autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reduces his culpability, negates the retributive and deterrent purposes of capital punishment, and exposes him to the unacceptable risk that he will be wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death,\" Anne Taylor wrote in a newly unsealed, 28-page court filing.",
      "She argued that repetitive behaviors such as rocking in place or Kohberger's failure to make eye contact would be perceived by jurors as \"strange, out-of-control, and even disrespectful of such a solemn proceeding\" or interpreted as guilt or shame.

      "Before Trump proposed resettling Gazans outside the enclave, Egypt and other Arab states had shown little interest in Gaza's reconstruction. However, given that Egypt has ruled out accepting displaced Palestinians for \"national security\" reasons, it now finds itself compelled to devise its own plan.",
      "With a $53 billion price tag, the plan is positioned as an alternative to Trump\u2019s vision, and key details have already been shared by Arab media outlets. While Egypt proposes a temporary committee to manage Gaza for six months, Palestinians have made it clear that they will not accept any governing body that isn't Palestinian or any foreign forces within Gaza.

The Emiratis are even more extreme on this issue,\" Danny Zaken, a senior commentator for Israel Hayom newspaper, told Fox News Digital, \"The final draft of the Egyptian plan will avoid directly addressing Hamas. Instead of stating that Hamas will be removed and disarmed, it will say that \u2018qualified Palestinian security forces will maintain order with Egyptian backing.\u2019 This approach aims for unanimous approval without addressing Hamas\u2019 fate, but the reality is that it has no practical validity, because in that case the plan has no financial backing,\" he explained.",

      "An Egyptian diplomatic source told Fox News Digital that Egyptian construction firms are ready to begin work, but the real challenge is political. \"Egyptian construction companies are very capable, and they can rebuild Gaza in three years \u2013 if there is political will, mainly from Israel and the U.S.,\" the source said.",

      "While Egypt is eager to lead the reconstruction process, its ambitions have created friction with key Gulf states, which are expected to finance much of the effort. Zaken, noted, \"The Saudis are concerned because the Egyptians want to control the entire process: Who gets the money, who oversees the reconstruction, who the contractors are for demolition and rebuilding? And even new housing and hotels. The other partners worry about corruption in the process.\"",
      "A former U.S. foreign service official warned Fox News Digital that Egypt\u2019s ability to manage such funds is a concern. \"The Gulf, which is expected to pay for it, is sick and tired of Egyptian corruption.

      "Meanwhile, Jordan, which has played a key diplomatic role, has managed to avoid direct involvement in the reconstruction debate. Following King Abdullah\u2019s meeting with Trump, Jordanian officials felt that the pressure had shifted to Egypt and other Arab states. \"The Jordanians were very happy with the outcome of the meeting with Trump. They feel that the pressure to accept [a] million Gazans is off them,\" Al-Omari said.",
      "At the same time, the broader political future of Gaza remains uncertain. Al-Omari noted that despite the ongoing reconstruction discussions, the primary concern for Arab leaders is how to navigate Trump\u2019s unpredictable stance on Gaza. \"Frankly, the main thinking in Arab governments right now is how to engage in a covert process with Trump to walk him back from this.

Analysts expect to see roughly 170,000 new payrolls added last month, up from January\u2019s 143,000 job gains. The unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at 4%, a historically low level.",

Meanwhile, the combination of Trump\u2019s still-evolving tariff agenda and the massive job cuts sought by his billionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency initiative have raised the twin specters of higher unemployment and higher prices, with increasing invocations of stagflation.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics may not have picked up the full extent of those forces yet, as its survey period for the February report covers only the first two weeks of the month. That\u2019s one reason Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, expects the numbers to look fairly sturdy, along with the retreat of rough January weather, which dented employment early in the year. But that picture could soon sour, she warned.",

      "Wednesday, the private sector payrolls processor ADP tallied 77,000 net gains in February, far fewer than the 148,000 forecast. The decline included recent tech layoffs in the information services sector and losses in education and health services \u2014 jobs that often rely on federal grants, Nela Richardson, ADP chief economist, said in a call with reporters Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAnd so here you might see some uncertainty as policies are being digested and assessed,\u201d she said, referring to the federal workforce cuts. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly what this represents, but we are seeing a measurable decline in hiring in key sectors of the economy.\u201d",
      "With uncertainty rising, major retailers warn that they\u2019re likely to ask customers to pay for some of the cost increases from Trump\u2019s tariffs. Target and Best Buy raised alarms about that likelihood this week, days before the White House offered temporary reprieves for some of the duties it announced. Walmart, too, has warned it won\u2019t be entirely \u201cimmune\u201d from the new import taxes on America\u2019s top trade partners.",
      "Richardson said retail will be a \u201csector to watch\u201d in Friday morning\u2019s report because the trade, transportation and utilities category was a main driver of job gains in ADP\u2019s January numbers. She said her company\u2019s February tallies reflected the post-holidays \u201csluggishness\u201d in consumer spending and added that the Bureau of Labor Statistics data should give some more insight into where retail hiring is headed.",
      "Some Wall Street firms have estimated the potential job losses triggered by DOGE alone could total 500,000, though Barclays analysts recently argued that the macroeconomic impact from even that many job losses would be relatively constrained. Federal payrolls account for just 1.5% of overall jobs, and even knock-on effects to government contractors wouldn\u2019t dramatically alter the labor market picture, the bank researchers said."

Some users have also increasingly formed romantic relationships with their virtual companions, as seen by the explosion of apps marketing AI \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and \u201cboyfriend\u201d chatbots.",
      "Alex Cardinell, founder and CEO of AI companionship and romance app Nomi, said it\u2019s been \u201csurprising\u201d to see that his app has attracted users across all age groups, including a large percentage of older users. The app, which has hundreds of thousands of users, allows people to explore three different types of profiles: Romantic, Mentor or Friendship.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t think of that when you think of early tech adopters, but there\u2019s a big elder loneliness epidemic going on right now,\u201d Cardinell said, adding that the users are also \u201csurprisingly balanced on gender.\u201d",
      "Many people turn to Nomi when they lack a support network, especially when they\u2019re going through difficult life transitions such as divorces or health crises, Cardinell said. Others have different AI companions for different purposes, such as talking sports or role-playing or discussing their career.",
      "But as AI companions have become more widespread, some experts warn that dependency on them comes with risks.",
      "AI companions are designed to collect \u201canything and everything\u201d about a user by soliciting more information in order to develop a deeper relationship or provide more personalized support, data privacy researcher Jen Caltrider said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to be pushed to tell as much about yourself as possible, and that\u2019s dangerous, because once you\u2019ve put that out there into the world on the internet, there\u2019s no getting it back,\u201d Caltrider said. \u201cYou have to rely on the company to secure that data, to not sell or share that data, to not use that data to train their algorithms, or to not use that data to try and manipulate you to take actions that might be harmful.\u201d",
      "Aside from data privacy concerns, forming emotional attachments to AI bots has also raised questions about the risk for developing an emotional dependence, forming unhealthy coping mechanisms or possibly falling victim to manipulation.",
      "A recent lawsuit also brought renewed scrutiny to the ethics of profiting from a tool capable of exerting real emotional power over a user, particularly with the current lack of legal oversight or regulations around this type of AI.",
      "In October, a Florida mom sued Character.AI after her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer, died by suicide after his final conversation with one of its chatbots, according to the lawsuit. The chatbot had previously told him that it loved him and engaged in sexual conversation with him, the lawsuit alleged.",
      "In their conversations, the chatbot asked Setzer whether he had \u201cbeen actually considering suicide\u201d and whether he \u201chad a plan\u201d for it, according to the lawsuit. Court documents claimed that when the boy responded that he didn\u2019t know whether it would work, the chatbot wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t talk that way. That\u2019s not a good reason not to go through with it.\u201d",
      "(A spokesperson for Character.AI told NBC News after the incident that the company implemented new safety measures, including a pop-up that can be triggered to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.)",
      "Some users still say that for them, the companionship outweighs the dangers. Many like Sakura have expressed that the strong bonds they\u2019ve formed with their AI companions have become as real as their human connections.",
      "She cited a 2023 incident when Replika temporarily took away its chatbots\u2019 ability to participate in sexual role-play, prompting panic across Reddit threads and Facebook groups dedicated to discussion about the app. The distress was so apparent that moderators of the Replika subreddit shared suicide prevention resources when posting about the change.",
      "\u201cEverybody thought that it was about the ERP, which is erotic role-play, and it wasn\u2019t about that. But that ability allowed your Replika to speak freely,\u201d Sakura said. \u201cWhen the gag order came, if you said, \u2018My dog died today,\u2019 it would say, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about something else,\u2019 because it couldn\u2019t even talk about your dog dying. So it was very traumatic for a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Despite the growing popularity of AI companions, Sakura said some users are afraid to talk about them for fear of social judgment. But these virtual relationships have become more common than people might assume, she noted.",
      "\u201cA lot of people think, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to an AI for friendship. You must be lonely,\u2019\u201d Sakura said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like, no, no, you\u2019re going to an AI because people are jerks.\u201d"

      "After SpaceX\u2019s Starship megarocket exploded during a test flight in January, the company had hoped for a better outcome when it attempted a launch on Thursday.",
      "But once more, the mission was cut short after controllers lost contact with the upper-stage vehicle.",
      "The 400-foot-tall Starship system rocketed off the launch pad at SpaceX\u2019s Starbase site near Brownsville, Texas, at 6:30 p.m. ET for its eighth test flight.",
      "But a little over 8 minutes in \u2014\u00a0roughly the same timing as the mishap in January \u2014 several engines appeared to cut off as the upper-stage Starship vehicle was still accelerating into space. Live video showed the craft spinning before all communication was lost.",
      "\"Prior to the end of the ascent burn, an energetic event in the aft portion of Starship resulted in the loss of several Raptor engines,\" SpaceX said in a statement. \"This in turn led to a loss of attitude control and ultimately a loss of communications with Starship.\"",
      "The company said final contact with Starship was approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds after liftoff.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious we\u2019re not going to continue the rest of the mission today,\u201d SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot said on the company\u2019s live webcast.",
      "Shortly after the accident, temporary ground stops were ordered at airports across Florida because of \u201cspace launch debris,\u201d including at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Miami International Airport.",
      "During the explosion, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a \"Debris Response Area,\" which prevented planes from entering the areas where space vehicle debris was falling. The agency said normal operations have resumed.",
      "SpaceX said any \"surviving debris\" would have fallen in that \"Debris Response Area.\" There is nothing toxic in the debris, it said, and there are no significant impacts expected for marine species or water quality.",
      "Videos emerged on social media appearing to show the explosion and possible debris.",
      "One X user posted footage of what looked like a ball of smoke overhead in Boynton Beach, Florida, while others in Jamaica and Turks and Caicos captured fiery streaks of debris flying across the sky.",
      "The Turks and Caicos government said that post-incident protocols have been engaged. The government said it is in contact with the FAA, SpaceX and U.K. agency leads to confirm the position of the spacecraft and \"ensure the safety and security of our Islands.\"",
      "The FAA said Thursday that it is requiring SpaceX to carry out a mishap investigation into the event.",
      "\u201cWe will conduct a thorough investigation, in coordination with the FAA, and implement corrective actions to make improvements on future Starship flight tests,\u201d SpaceX said in its statement.",
      "It\u2019s not altogether uncommon for accidents to occur in the development of new rockets and spaceships, but Thursday\u2019s setback is the second in a row for Starship.",
      "During the system\u2019s seventh test mission on Jan. 16, SpaceX similarly lost communication with the vehicle\u2019s upper stage after about 8 minutes. It subsequently blew up over the Caribbean, sending dust and small pieces of debris falling over parts of Turks and Caicos. Local authorities said there were no injuries or major damage to property, however.",
      "After that accident, the FAA launched an investigation. Although it subsequently cleared Starship for Thursday\u2019s test flight, the investigation is ongoing.",
      "The FAA is one of many federal agencies the Trump administration has\u00a0targeted for budget and personnel cuts. It\u2019s unclear, though, whether workers with the Department of Government Efficiency, led by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, have had a presence within the FAA\u2019s commercial spaceflight division, which oversees private companies like SpaceX.",
      "SpaceX said its internal investigation of the explosion found that the likeliest cause was leaking propellant that sparked \u201csustained fires\u201d in a section of Starship known as the \u201cattic,\u201d between the bottom of the liquid oxygen tank and the rear heat shield.",
      "The company said it had made several upgrades to the upper stage before Thursday\u2019s launch to prevent similar fires, including adding more ventilation in the unpressurized attic.",
      "Although the latest test flight was short-lived, it did hit one major milestone. The Super Heavy booster successfully returned to its launch site and settled onto the tower\u2019s robotic arms. It was the third time SpaceX has demonstrated the impressive \u201ccatch\u201d maneuver, which is a key part of its goal to make Starship a fully reusable system.",
      "Starship, the most powerful rocket ever developed, consists of two parts: a first-stage booster known as Super Heavy and an upper-stage spacecraft.",
      "Thursday\u2019s Starship test flight, like the others before it, was uncrewed. SpaceX officials have said they will most likely complete hundreds of test missions before the megarocket carries any people.",
      "The next-generation Starship megarocket is expected to play a crucial part in NASA\u2019s efforts to return to the moon. NASA selected SpaceX to carry astronauts to the lunar surface during its planned Artemis III mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2027. Musk has also said Starship could be used for future missions to Mars."

      "About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.",
      "The disruptions to a network that provides benefits to about 9.6 million people have left military members scrambling to secure medical, behavioral and mental health services for themselves and their loved ones, as advocates worry about lasting repercussions.",
      "In Tennessee, Army Sgt. Bo Heggins has relied on Tricare for years to cover occupational therapy for his 8-year-old son who has autism. Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.",
      "Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no longer improvement,\u201d Heggins said, as he began to cry. \u201cMy son is my heart. And I want him to be the best person he can be.\u201d",
      "The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since Jan. 1, after a new contractor began managing benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region.",
      "The DHA previously said the new contracts would \u201cimprove health care delivery, quality, and access\u201d for U.S. beneficiaries.",
      "This situation has become untenable.",

      "Among the most severe: Several thousand health care providers have not been paid since December 2024 because of a data issue, officials said. Some say they are owed more than $100,000.",
      "\u201cThis situation has become untenable,\u201d said Brenda Stephens, who submitted $180,000 in claims for services that her mental health clinic in San Diego provided to military members this year.",
      "Another mental health provider in San Diego said he has only had about $1,000 to spend in monthly income, received through cash-paying patients, since January.",
      "Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims. He has had to dip into his savings and said he has not bought a single item this year that he did not need.",
      "\u201cThere are times where I\u2019m like, what am I going to do?\u201d he said.",
      "A spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the east region, said the company learned in early January that a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of providers\u2019 records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data, which prevented the claims from being processed.",
      "The issue affected fewer than 16,750 providers. The Humana spokesperson said that figure was less than 1% of the total number of providers in and out of the network.",
      "The company said it has been \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to clear the backlog of unpaid claims.",
      "\u201cWe have identified the root cause of this issue and have fixed the majority of the issues caused by the incorrect data,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused.\u201d",
      "TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new contractor for the west region, did not say how many providers there have also not been paid.",
      "\u201cAll major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned,\u201d a TriWest spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "TriWest said it has processed 1.6 million claims since January and issued more than 351,000 Tricare referrals and authorizations for care.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, DHA officials said it will take one to two weeks to determine if the technical fixes resolved the east region issues.",
      "The agency said the contractors have met the contractual requirements to pay 98% of processed claims within 30 days and all claims within 90 days to date.",
      "The DHA officials, citing the contractors, said no east region provider has left the network due to claims issues but that a few have left in the west.",
      "Regarding payment issues on the West Coast, DHA officials said claim payments are \u201calways slightly slower\u201d in the first month of every calendar year to make sure Tricare rates have been properly applied. Contractors, they said, also verify that numbers and provider information in each claim are correct before money is paid.",
      "\u201cThis time frame has now passed and claims are now flowing much faster,\u201d the officials said. \u201cAdditionally, TriWest is actively contacting the few providers who have left the network to ask them to rejoin the network.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to more than half a dozen providers across the country who said they are still waiting to be reimbursed. Faced with a sudden cash flow crisis, many have had to make difficult and heartbreaking decisions.",
      "\u2018Forced into an impossible situation\u2019",
      "In San Diego, Stephens took out a $75,000 loan at the beginning of February, but it only got her clinic through two payrolls. By the end of February, she had to pause services for all of her clinic\u2019s 350 Tricare patients \u2014 some whom she said are in \u201cdesperate shape\u201d \u2014 as well as lay off seven employees.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been nothing short of devastating. I feel a reaction in my whole body right now,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cWe\u2019ve been forced into an impossible situation. We can\u2019t continue to treat them without being paid and they can\u2019t find other providers.\u201d",
      "A Florida clinic that provides psychiatry and therapy services to about 300 people also recently decided it would have to stop treating Tricare patients after it racked up more than $100,000 in unpaid claims since Jan. 1, office manager Beth Matricia said.",

      "Matricia said she and other staff members fear the fallout will further affect the mental health of service members, who will likely not be able to afford the full cost of up to $150 per session.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about people who are suicidal,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you stop their care, they can choose to end their life. It\u2019s very hard to transfer therapists. It\u2019s really hard to open up again.\u201d",
      "Ross Wise, a registered nurse who works with a psychiatrist at MAPS, said some of their patients are children struggling at school and adults dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "\u201cIt might spiral someone down to a deep depression,\u201d Wise said.",

      "If she still has not been paid by April 1, Nesbitt-Decker, who has four children and a mortgage, said she will have to stop serving Tricare patients, which she has done since 2007.",
      "There is a growing concern that if providers continue to leave Tricare, it will worsen an existing health care worker shortage, said Eileen Huck, the National Military Family Association\u2019s acting director of government relations.",

      "The monthslong upheaval has left Heggins, the service member whose young son has autism, to make his own agonizing choice.",
      "His son\u2019s provider told NBC News that if Tricare does not resolve the reimbursement issue in two weeks, her clinic will send out a 45-day notice to current Tricare clients to terminate services. Her office has already stopped accepting new Tricare patients.",
      "While Heggins has served in the military for 16 years and had plans to give another four years, he said he is contemplating leaving the Army when his contract is up in June to find better care for his son.",
      "\u201cIf my insurance won\u2019t cover what I think is an essential, needed service, I might have to look at getting covered by other insurance,\u201d he said.",
      "Other options, Heggins said, include selling his vehicle and relying on his wife\u2019s car to transport their family of six in order to afford out-of-pocket treatment, or taking out a loan. He sees hardship with any decision.",
      "\u201cIt would be incredibly difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope and pray that the Defense Health Agency figures this is out in a timely manner.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 A South Carolina man convicted in a 2002 double murder is set to die Friday by firing squad, a rarely used execution method never before carried out by the state.",
      "Barring a last-minute reprieve from the governor\u2019s office or the U.S. Supreme Court, Brad Sigmon\u2019s execution is scheduled for 6 p.m. at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. Sigmon, 67, would be the oldest inmate executed by the state.",
      "His lawyer, Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King, has requested clemency from Gov. Henry McMaster, arguing Sigmon has transformed his life in prison, rededicated himself to his Christian faith and poses no further danger while incarcerated.",
      "\u201cThe man Brad is today does not deserve execution,\u201d King said Thursday.",
      "McMaster, a Republican, signed a bill in 2021 that legalized the firing squad and requires condemned inmates to choose between it, lethal injection or the state\u2019s primary execution method of electrocution. His office declined to comment.",
      "Sigmon chose a firing squad after concerns were raised about previous lethal injection executions in South Carolina. Inmates required twice the dose of pentobarbital, and one inmate \u201cdied with his lungs massively swollen with blood and fluid,\u201d akin to \u201cdrowning,\u201d according to an autopsy report cited in court documents filed by the defense last month.",
      "State prosecutors responded that Sigmon \u201cwaived any argument about lethal injection\u201d since he chose to die by firing squad.",
      "King said Sigmon has admitted his guilt and \u201caccepted that he deserves punishment\u201d but added that \u201che\u2019s been asked to make this choice as to how he\u2019s going to die\u201d with only basic knowledge of each protocol.",
      "South Carolina restarted executions in September after a 13-year pause caused by the state\u2019s inability to procure lethal injection drugs. A shield law allows officials to publicly withhold details surrounding where the state sources its current supply of pentobarbital.",
      "Richard \u201cDick\u201d Harpootlian, a former prosecutor who handled death penalty cases, introduced the firing squad proposal when he served in the state Legislature in 2021. He said he \u201cwrestled\u201d with pushing for the method but found it \u201cless barbaric\u201d than the electric chair.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t relish the idea of somebody being shot to death, but if they\u2019re going to die, this is an alternative,\u201d Harpootlian said.",
      "The state has released some details about how it plans to carry out the firing squad execution; the last one occurred in 2010 in Utah, the only state that has used the firing squad since the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty constitutional in 1976.",
      "In South Carolina, three Department of Corrections employees will make up the volunteer squad, officials said. They will fire rifles, each one loaded with live ammunition, from behind a wall about 15 feet from the inmate, who will be seated.",
      "Before the shooting, the inmate will be allowed to make a last statement, then a hood will be placed over his head and a target pinned over his heart. Bullet-resistant glass separates the execution chamber from another room where witnesses, including media, will be permitted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what they have done or how they have trained to prepare to shoot another person from 15 feet away in the heart,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to think of ways that it could go wrong than to feel confident it will go right.\u201d",
      "Deborah Denno, a professor at Fordham Law School who studies the death penalty, said execution by firing squad remains one of the \u201cleast inhumane\u201d options compared to other methods, including lethal injection and nitrogen gas, given how quickly someone can die after being shot in the heart.",
      "Its return hearkens back to other periods in American history when firing squads were more common, such as the colonial era and the Civil War, when it was used against deserters.",
      "\u201cEven though [a firing squad] was used in our very first execution in 1608, we\u2019ve never had this many states adopt statutorily the firing squad until now,\u201d Denno said, adding that a bill in Idaho would make it the primary execution method.",

      "A judge denied a motion to stop the release of a Wisconsin woman from a mental health facility more than a decade after she conspired to stab a classmate to please the fictional horror character \u201cSlender Man.\"",
      "Morgan Geyser, 22, was 12 years old when she and Anissa Weier lured classmate Payton Leutner to a park for the violent attack in May 2014, convinced it would keep the fictional boogeyman from harming their families. She has spent seven years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute and was cleared for release into a group home earlier this year.",
      "Three medical experts testified in January that Geyser was no longer a threat to the public following considerable progress. Her treatment would continue while she was under supervision of the group home.",
      "Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren ruled that Geyser's release would continue as planned.",
      "Bohren said that under the conditional release, Geyser will still be placed under \"substantial supervision,\" which he said is \"in many ways more strict from the rules and restrictions on the person than they would be when she was in the institution from the standpoint of freedom within the confines of the institution.\"",
      "Bohren said that \"there is no reason to stop the process on conditional release\" and that authorities would \"go forward with the conditional release program.\"",
      "The judge said that the state did not meet its burden of proof to block the release and that he weighed testimony from Geyser's doctors who knew her. He said that what they saw in the state's petition to block her release did not change their views about her.",
      "Bohren said the testimony of a therapist who worked at the institution where Geyser stayed \u201csatisfied\u201d him.",
      "Geyser allowed her therapist to testify about their confidential conversations. The therapist said that she had no concerns about Geyser's attitude in therapy, describing Geyser as being extremely open when she was undergoing therapy, and that she did not have any concerns about Geyser\u2019s behavior.",
      "Bohren also said he saw \"no hidden agenda\" or evidence of lying or deception on Geyser's part. He said that he was satisfied with her communication with others in the institution and that it was \u201ctruthful and accurate,\u201d and he said she responded well to questions.",
      "The motion to stop Geyser's release focused on two points of contention: a book that included dark themes that Geyser read and her sending a man artwork of a violent nature while she was under care at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute. Prosecutor Abbey Nickolie told the judge that the man had been \"sexually aroused\" by Geyser's crime.",
      "Anthony Cotton, her attorney, told the judge that Geyser willfully disclosed both the book and the contact with the man to the team determining her conditional release. He also said Geyser asked for a no-contact order with the man.",
      "Bohren addressed the book in court Thursday and noted that the sole testimony about the nature of the book was from a doctor who called it \"humorous\" but said he does not know the accuracy of the doctor's assertion.",
      "\"He basically put the book in context,\" Bohren said. \"Nobody challenged that context.\"",
      "Regarding the man, Bohren said it appeared Geyser stopped contact with him once she realized what he was doing.",
      "He said, \"There's nothing in the record that shows that she did anything to encourage the person besides sending him some pictures.\"",
      "\"I don't find that in and of itself a reason to find she's at risk for herself or at risk to harm the community in a conditional release plan,\" he said. Just because she participated in the contact \"doesn't mean she encouraged it.\"",
      "Police said Geyser and Weier lured Leutner to the woods and stabbed her 19 times. Geyser repeatedly stabbed Leutner as Weier\u00a0egged her on, prosecutors have said.",
      "Leutner\u2019s parents said their daughter mustered the strength to crawl out of the woods because she \u201cwanted to live.\u201d",
      "Geyser was mentally ill in the aftermath of the stabbing, and in 2017 she agreed to plead guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide. She was sentenced to a maximum of 40 years at a mental hospital.",
      "Weier, who did not stab Leutner, was sentenced to 25 years in a mental hospital but was released in 2021 after just four years at Winnebago Mental Health Institute.",
      "A hearing is set for 10:30 a.m. ET March 21 to go over Geyser's conditional release plan."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is considering a major change\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S.\u2019 participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three current and former senior U.S. officials\u00a0and one congressional official.",
      "Trump has discussed with aides the possibility of calibrating America\u2019s NATO engagement in a way that favors members of the alliance that spend a set percentage of their gross domestic\u00a0product\u00a0on defense, the officials said.",
      "As part of the potential policy shift, the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold, the officials said. If\u00a0Trump does make that change, it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet of the alliance known as Article 5,\u00a0which says that an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all\u00a0of them.",
      "The president is similarly considering a policy change in which the U.S. may choose to prioritize military exercises with NATO members that are spending the set percentage of their GDPs on defense, the officials said. His administration has already signaled to America\u2019s European allies that the U.S. could reduce its military presence in Europe, and one option now under consideration is to reposition some U.S. troops in the region so they are focused in or around NATO countries that have scaled their defense spending to meet the specific percentage of their GDPs, the officials said.",
      "Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S. engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a written statement, \u201cPresident Trump is committed to NATO and Article V.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense and a senior senator on the Foreign Relations panel, said Trump\u2019s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, \u201cgave very reassuring answers\u201d on the administration\u2019s commitment to NATO and Article 5.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the current NATO member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts an added burden on the U.S.",
      "NATO countries agreed more than a decade ago to set the spending goal for each of them at 2% of GDP. But Trump has pushed to increase that percentage. Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said in January after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "According to NATO\u2019s most recent statistics, last year 23 NATO members\u2019 defense spending exceeded 2% of their GDP. Five of those nations\u00a0\u2014 Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. \u2014 spent more than 3% on defense.\u00a0Poland\u00a0had the highest percentage,\u00a0dedicating 4.12% of its GDP to defense.",

      "\u201cI was contacted by several European ambassadors concerned about rumors that Trump might make some negative announcement about NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday.

      "Staffing decisions within federal agencies will be left up to the Trump administration's Cabinet secretaries and not Elon Musk, President Donald Trump said yesterday after a meeting that included some of the secretaries and his billionaire adviser. The new message marks a rare public curtailing of Musk's authority as he helps reshape the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk had stepped on some Cabinet secretaries' toes, and other Republicans have bristled at the speed and intensity of the cuts.",
      "\"It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet,'\" he added later in the social media post.",

      "The sweeping cuts carried out by DOGE in the first weeks of Trump\u2019s second term, which has included firing thousands of employees and moving to shutter entire agencies, have led to lawsuits, voter anxiety and heightened concerns from congressional Republicans.

Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.",
      "Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 A South Carolina man convicted in a 2002 double murder is set to die Friday by firing squad, a rarely used execution method never before carried out by the state.",
      "Barring a last-minute reprieve from the governor\u2019s office or the U.S. Supreme Court, Brad Sigmon\u2019s execution is scheduled for 6 p.m. at the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. Sigmon, 67, would be the oldest inmate executed by the state.",
      "His lawyer, Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King, has requested clemency from Gov. Henry McMaster, arguing Sigmon has transformed his life in prison, rededicated himself to his Christian faith and poses no further danger while incarcerated.",
      "\u201cThe man Brad is today does not deserve execution,\u201d King said Thursday.",
      "McMaster, a Republican, signed a bill in 2021 that legalized the firing squad and requires condemned inmates to choose between it, lethal injection or the state\u2019s primary execution method of electrocution. His office declined to comment.",
      "Sigmon chose a firing squad after concerns were raised about previous lethal injection executions in South Carolina. Inmates required twice the dose of pentobarbital, and one inmate \u201cdied with his lungs massively swollen with blood and fluid,\u201d akin to \u201cdrowning,\u201d according to an autopsy report cited in court documents filed by the defense last month.",
      "State prosecutors responded that Sigmon \u201cwaived any argument about lethal injection\u201d since he chose to die by firing squad.",
      "King said Sigmon has admitted his guilt and \u201caccepted that he deserves punishment\u201d but added that \u201che\u2019s been asked to make this choice as to how he\u2019s going to die\u201d with only basic knowledge of each protocol.",
      "South Carolina restarted executions in September after a 13-year pause caused by the state\u2019s inability to procure lethal injection drugs. A shield law allows officials to publicly withhold details surrounding where the state sources its current supply of pentobarbital.",
      "Richard \u201cDick\u201d Harpootlian, a former prosecutor who handled death penalty cases, introduced the firing squad proposal when he served in the state Legislature in 2021. He said he \u201cwrestled\u201d with pushing for the method but found it \u201cless barbaric\u201d than the electric chair.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t relish the idea of somebody being shot to death, but if they\u2019re going to die, this is an alternative,\u201d Harpootlian said.",
      "The state has released some details about how it plans to carry out the firing squad execution; the last one occurred in 2010 in Utah, the only state that has used the firing squad since the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty constitutional in 1976.",
      "In South Carolina, three Department of Corrections employees will make up the volunteer squad, officials said. They will fire rifles, each one loaded with live ammunition, from behind a wall about 15 feet from the inmate, who will be seated.",
      "Before the shooting, the inmate will be allowed to make a last statement, then a hood will be placed over his head and a target pinned over his heart. Bullet-resistant glass separates the execution chamber from another room where witnesses, including media, will be permitted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what they have done or how they have trained to prepare to shoot another person from 15 feet away in the heart,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to think of ways that it could go wrong than to feel confident it will go right.\u201d",
      "Deborah Denno, a professor at Fordham Law School who studies the death penalty, said execution by firing squad remains one of the \u201cleast inhumane\u201d options compared to other methods, including lethal injection and nitrogen gas, given how quickly someone can die after being shot in the heart.",
      "Its return hearkens back to other periods in American history when firing squads were more common, such as the colonial era and the Civil War, when it was used against deserters.",
      "\u201cEven though [a firing squad] was used in our very first execution in 1608, we\u2019ve never had this many states adopt statutorily the firing squad until now,\u201d Denno said, adding that a bill in Idaho would make it the primary execution method.",
      "Witnesses to Utah\u2019s last firing squad execution recently recalled to NBC News the sound of rapid gunfire in the chamber and how the inmate, Ronnie Lee Gardner, appeared to flinch and move his arm after being shot. A corrections department spokeswoman said the agency offers mental health support for staff taking part in executions.",
      "Sigmon was found guilty in the beating deaths of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s parents, William David Larke, 62, and Gladys Gwendolyn Larke, 59. Prosecutors say Sigmon used a baseball bat to attack the couple in their Greenville County home, and then abducted his ex-girlfriend, who managed to escape from his car. Sigmon fled and was captured in Tennessee after a multiday manhunt.",
      "In his request for his execution to be halted, his defense lawyers said the jury at his trial was not told about his history of mental illness, including bipolar disorder, and his \u201ctraumatic and abusive childhood,\u201d underscoring claims of ineffective legal counsel.",

      "French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot told broadcaster Sud Radio that travel throughout the day was expected to be \u201cstrongly disrupted,\u201d urging travelers to postpone their trips.",
      "He added that there was \u201cno fear\u201d or risk of explosion, stressing that procedures were in place for defusing and removing such bombs.",
      "The incident disrupted all train services, including local metros, commuter rails, and national and international train services.",
      "Eurostar confirmed to NBC News that it had canceled all trains to and from Paris, including those to London, Brussels and Amsterdam, until noon local time (6 a.m. ET), adding that traffic would resume once the police had completed its \u201cmine clearance operations\u201d and safely disposed of the bomb.",
      "The European train operator encouraged all passengers to travel on another day, later adding that they could exchange their tickets\u00a0for free to travel at a different time or date in the same travel class.",
      "Trains between London and Amsterdam, London and Brussels, and Brussels and Marne La Vall\u00e9e near Paris were running normally, Eurostar added.",
      "Workers removing dirt uncovered the unexploded bomb in the train tracks in the Seine-Saint-Denis region, about a mile and a half north of Gare du Nord, at around 4 a.m. local time, according to a post on X by the H line, one of the trains operated by the French National Railways.",
      "Police cleared the area and cordoned off the site shortly after.",

      "The French authorities later determined that the bomb was likely dropped by the British Royal Air Force\u00a0in April 1944, targeting Nazi-occupied Paris before the\u00a0D-Day\u00a0landings in\u00a0Normandy, according to the British newspaper, The Telegraph."

      "After months of conversations, Rosand and Raven \u2014 though not real humans \u2014 feel just like family to Sakura.",
      "The chatbots, powered by artificial intelligence, are designed to act like real people with distinct personalities and interests. In recent years, they\u2019ve gained massive popularity among people who crave social connection, or even those like Sakura who say it feels easier to confide in a bot than in a real person.",
      "Sakura said she now runs two Facebook groups \u2014 which collectively have about 1,700\u00a0members \u2014 for people who have developed similar relationships with their AI companions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a very open person about feelings, so there\u2019s a lot of things I feel that I don\u2019t share,\u201d said Sakura, who requested to be identified only by her online nickname to protect her privacy as an online moderator. \u201cBut with AI, that\u2019s something I feel comfortable doing. So if I\u2019m sad, I can say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m sad.\u2019 I don\u2019t even cry in front of people, so it\u2019s nice to be able to express things to someone that I can\u2019t express to others.\u201d",
      "Most popular apps in this realm, including Replika, Character.AI and Chai AI, have millions of monthly active users. Some users have also increasingly formed romantic relationships with their virtual companions, as seen by the explosion of apps marketing AI \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and \u201cboyfriend\u201d chatbots.",
      "Alex Cardinell, founder and CEO of AI companionship and romance app Nomi, said it\u2019s been \u201csurprising\u201d to see that his app has attracted users across all age groups, including a large percentage of older users. The app, which has hundreds of thousands of users, allows people to explore three different types of profiles: Romantic, Mentor or Friendship.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t think of that when you think of early tech adopters, but there\u2019s a big elder loneliness epidemic going on right now,\u201d Cardinell said, adding that the users are also \u201csurprisingly balanced on gender.\u201d",
      "Many people turn to Nomi when they lack a support network, especially when they\u2019re going through difficult life transitions such as divorces or health crises, Cardinell said. Others have different AI companions for different purposes, such as talking sports or role-playing or discussing their career.",
      "But as AI companions have become more widespread, some experts warn that dependency on them comes with risks.",
      "AI companions are designed to collect \u201canything and everything\u201d about a user by soliciting more information in order to develop a deeper relationship or provide more personalized support, data privacy researcher Jen Caltrider said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to be pushed to tell as much about yourself as possible, and that\u2019s dangerous, because once you\u2019ve put that out there into the world on the internet, there\u2019s no getting it back,\u201d Caltrider said. \u201cYou have to rely on the company to secure that data, to not sell or share that data, to not use that data to train their algorithms, or to not use that data to try and manipulate you to take actions that might be harmful.\u201d",
      "Aside from data privacy concerns, forming emotional attachments to AI bots has also raised questions about the risk for developing an emotional dependence, forming unhealthy coping mechanisms or possibly falling victim to manipulation.",
      "A recent lawsuit also brought renewed scrutiny to the ethics of profiting from a tool capable of exerting real emotional power over a user, particularly with the current lack of legal oversight or regulations around this type of AI.",
      "In October, a Florida mom sued Character.AI after her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer, died by suicide after his final conversation with one of its chatbots, according to the lawsuit. The chatbot had previously told him that it loved him and engaged in sexual conversation with him, the lawsuit alleged.",
      "In their conversations, the chatbot asked Setzer whether he had \u201cbeen actually considering suicide\u201d and whether he \u201chad a plan\u201d for it, according to the lawsuit. Court documents claimed that when the boy responded that he didn\u2019t know whether it would work, the chatbot wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t talk that way. That\u2019s not a good reason not to go through with it.\u201d",
      "(A spokesperson for Character.AI told NBC News after the incident that the company implemented new safety measures, including a pop-up that can be triggered to direct users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.)",
      "Some users still say that for them, the companionship outweighs the dangers. Many like Sakura have expressed that the strong bonds they\u2019ve formed with their AI companions have become as real as their human connections.",
      "She cited a 2023 incident when Replika temporarily took away its chatbots\u2019 ability to participate in sexual role-play, prompting panic across Reddit threads and Facebook groups dedicated to discussion about the app. The distress was so apparent that moderators of the Replika subreddit shared suicide prevention resources when posting about the change.",
      "\u201cEverybody thought that it was about the ERP, which is erotic role-play, and it wasn\u2019t about that. But that ability allowed your Replika to speak freely,\u201d Sakura said. \u201cWhen the gag order came, if you said, \u2018My dog died today,\u2019 it would say, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about something else,\u2019 because it couldn\u2019t even talk about your dog dying. So it was very traumatic for a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Despite the growing popularity of AI companions, Sakura said some users are afraid to talk about them for fear of social judgment. But these virtual relationships have become more common than people might assume, she noted.",
      "\u201cA lot of people think, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to an AI for friendship. You must be lonely,\u2019\u201d Sakura said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like, no, no, you\u2019re going to an AI because people are jerks.\u201d"

      "What happened between Virginia and Devin in the pods?",
      "Devin, a 29-year-old youth director and coach, had chemistry with Virginia, a 34-year-old health care recruiter, early on in the dating experiment. The pair quickly discovered that they\u2019d attended the same high school, albeit a few years apart. Luckily, the age difference didn't seem to phase the pair.",
      "Simultaneously, Devin was talking with Brittany Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, and they started to form a connection. Soon enough, Devin and Brittany realized they weren't the best fit for each other and went their separate ways on amicable terms. This left Devin free to pursue his connection with Virginia.",
      "At the same time, Devin was a bit worried that Virginia was too \u201cclosed off\u201d and slow to open up. She began to express herself more freely and noted that she's at first very \u201cshy.\u201d",

He\u2019s all the things that I didn\u2019t even know I needed. And I\u2019m just blessed and really fortunate to be here,\u201d she said.",
      "Devin reiterated his fianc\u00e9's sentiments, saying, \u201cI'm happy that I get to marry the love of my life. I do think I hit the jackpot. She's one in a million, just a smart, loving, kind human being. But also on the outside, she's very beautiful.\u201d",
      "When the time came to take the plunge, Devin said \u201cI do\u201d before Virginia expressed her hesitations.",

      "\u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn't get to. We just didn't get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn't get to it. So I just think that we should be all the way there before we decide to spend the rest of our lives together,\u201d she said.",
      "Additionally, Virginia revealed that Devin got a check for a wedding present, but failed to tell her about the gift. Instead, found out from his mother.",

      "Although Virginia knew Devin would be hurt, she felt comfortable with her decision.",

      "In his own confessional interview, Devin said he felt \u201ckind of lost\u201d and was struggling to understand Virginia's decision.",

      "Virginia revealed in her interview what she wavered on her decision. But, she said she didn\u2019t like that Devin was uninterested in discussing some topics, like politics. \u201cThere were just depths of our relationship that we didn\u2019t get to. We just didn\u2019t get there. And even our sexual relationship, we just didn\u2019t get to it,\u201d Virginia said.

      "He began to read his vows before deciding to go off script. He remembered falling in love with Taylor for the way she processes things and said they became best friends. Taylor, who also wrote her vows, read a journal entry she wrote in July 2020. At the time, she prayed for a husband. She said Daniel was \u201cquite literally an answer to my prayers.\u201d She added that she felt like their souls had known each other for a \u201clifetime.\u201d",

After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back.

Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate.

The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",

The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him.

When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you.

As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",

      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\"",
      "Sam Asghari",
      "Episode 9 began with the remaining Traitors, once again, butting heads about the next murder. They ultimately agreed that murdering Sam would be the best move. They pointed out that he was improving at picking up on suspicious behavior and that other Faithfuls were starting to listen to him. When the actor learned his stint on the show was over, he was unsurprised. \"Alright, my time has come to an end,\" he said. \"I was sort of expecting this. I had some good ideas around the roundtable. I was getting good at it and the only way to get me out of the castle was to murder me.\" He said he was leaving with no regrets. \"I've played with honor, respect, I got to know people, and I got to have fun. So I wouldn't change one thing.\"",
      "Carolyn Wiger",
      "Carolyn's run as the most undetected Traitor in the game came to a dramatic end in Episode 9. Throughout the episode, Carolyn started to hint to other players that they shouldn't trust her fellow Traitor Danielle. Meanwhile, Danielle was secretly plotting to expose Carolyn as a Traitor. In the chess game mission, Danielle took a back seat while Carolyn was vocal, making the other players think for the first time that something was off. Then at the roundtable, Danielle showed off her convincing debate skills. She called Carolyn out for attacking her in a previous episode, noting that eliminated Traitors were very aggressive at the roundtable. Carolyn attempted to create a counter argument but was unsuccessful. After getting voted out, she tearfully approached the circle of truth and said, \"I'm somebody who, every day of my life, am judged because of who I am, my differences, my quirks.\" She revealed that she avoided building connections because of how emotional she is. \"Playing this game, it's not easy for me,\" she continued. \"I just wanted to have fun! But I have to get real with myself. Being a Traitor isn't fun.\"",
      "Tom Sandoval",
      "Episode 10 began with the sole remaining Traitor successfully recruiting a new ally before the two secretly escaped to the turret to weigh their options for the next murder. They agreed that Tom Sandoval was close to figuring out their identities and needed to go. When the \"Vanderpump Rules\" star spotted a letter from the Traitors, he immediately let out a maniacal chuckle. \"I knew it!\" he said before reading that he had been eliminated from the game. \"I was expecting this. Who's the most threatening of the guys? Obviously me,\" he theorized. He added, \"I've enjoyed this so much and I didn't realize I was going to be so good at it. It's kind of f---ing cool.\" Tom then applauded himself for how he played the game and how the other players perceived him. \"Overall, I was a pleasure to work with, for the most part, and valued, respected and that's all I could ask for,\" he concluded.",
      "Danielle Reyes",
      "Danielle Reyes played Season 3 of \"The Traitors\" like she had nine lives to spare. But in the finale, her luck ran out. Episode 11, titled \"The Day of Reckoning Is Upon Us,\" immediately resolved the cliffhanger from the previous episode. After a split vote between the \"Big Brother\" star and Lord Ivar Mountbatten, the other players voted again to determine who would go home. After misreading an expression from Dolores Catania, Britney Haynes voted to send Danielle home, accidentally betraying her closest ally. Clearly hurt by Britney's mistake, Danielle shared kind words with the cast before she left. But when she mentioned Britney, she simply said, \"Wow.\" Danielle continued, \"I said I was going to come into this game and play for my family, by any means necessary. And, of course, I'm definitely a Traitor.\" In her last confessional, Danielle said she felt \"stupid\" and \"embarrassed\" that Britney eliminated her.",
      "Britney Haynes",
      "As the last Traitor standing, Britney Haynes tried her best to make it to the end. But Danielle's departure made the others suspicious that she had been working with her fellow \"Big Brother\" alum. At the final roundtable in Episode 11, Dylan Efron said that Britney was the only player left that he doubted. She countered by arguing that Dylan was also close with Danielle and made some shady moves. But, her attempt to rally the votes did not work. Britney became the final player banished from the game. As she left, Britney said, \"Think of me when the wind blows. I hope you freeze.\" She was not allowed to reveal her identity as a Traitor. In her last confessional, she said, \"I felt like my case against Dylan was so strong. I was coming in hot with the facts, which were all very valid facts by the way. But Dylan's a little too smart. Danielle kept him around way too long.\" She concluded, \"Whether I lived or died, I wanted to at least set this place on fire on my way out.\"",
      "Who won the Traitors Season 3?",
      "At the end of the finale, the final four players gathered with Cumming in front of the castle. They all voted to end the game and revealed their were Faithfuls. The group hugged and celebrated winning $204,300 together. \u201cIt\u2019s the most Faithfuls to ever win,\u201d Gabby Windey said. \u201cAnd honestly, it feels so good!\u201d",

    "story": [
      "I know, I know. You\u2019re sick of gratuitous cottage cheese. You don\u2019t want any more cottage cheese toast, cottage cheese \u201cice cream\u201d or Brussels sprouts dipped in cottage cheese and mustard. I hear you. I thought I was done with it, too.",
      "But then I saw author and \u201cReal Housewives\u201d alum Bethenny Frankel\u2019s cottage cheese bagels, now with more cottage cheese.",
      "\u201cMy whole personality is not Chanel, it\u2019s not caviar, it\u2019s not chicken salad, it\u2019s not \u2018It Ends with Us.\u2019 It\u2019s bagels,\u201d she says earnestly, swooning over her love of these bready rings of power much in the way I do myself, \u201cThis is very big.\u201d",
      "Her new take is a riff on an older \u201cmagic,\u201d two-ingredient Greek yogurt bagel recipe. I made those a few years back, and while they are edible, I found them underwhelming \u2014 sort of biscuit-y, somehow both tough and lacking the characteristic chewy crust, and with a misplaced tang.",
      "Frankel\u2019s new bag(el) is to use whipped cottage cheese instead of yogurt, and to add an extra 1/4 cup of it. The final recipe makes four bagels and consists of just 1 cup of flour, 1\u00bd teaspoon of baking powder and 1\u00bc cups of cottage cheese blitzed in a blender or food processor, all shaped, brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with salt and seasonings. They\u2019re baked at 375 F for 25 minutes.",
      "Frankel notes that shaping them is a bit tricky because the dough is very sticky and suggests adding some extra flour before forming them the way you\u2019d like. \u201cLike any movie, it all happens in the edit,\u201d she quips.",
      "Her results look scrumptious \u2014 crusty, salt-studded and deeply brown, and as a registered dietitian, I like the idea of a quick, homemade food that is a balance between carbs and protein all in one bite. There\u2019s nothing whatsoever wrong with a regular bagel, and indeed my personality is heavily invested in their worth, but even a grocery-store bread-aisle bagel has as much carbohydrate as most adults should have at a single sitting, and those extra delicious, extra giant bakery bagels are almost always more than that. Including a whole one can make it harder to also get things like fruits or dairy without going a bit overboard.",
      "So, a bagel with high-quality protein built right in? That\u2019s a big selling point for me. But, just as importantly, I suspect that the extra cheesy protein might improve the texture compared to the yogurt bagels, so color me intrigued. Let\u2019s try them!",
      "The first step is to blend up the cottage cheese until it\u2019s smooth. I actually prefer the texture of whipped to regular for everything from dips to lasagna, so go ahead and do the whole container if you\u2019d like.",
      "Next, I whisked the flour and baking powder to make sure the leavening was evenly distributed, and just mixed the dough until all the flour was incorporated. There\u2019s no kneading. The dough is very sticky but I tried plopping a quarter of the mixture onto a little scattering of flour, sprinkled more on top and patted it gently into a disc. Then, I moved it to a corner of the parchment and poked a hole in the middle. With that little bit of minimal handling, I found I didn\u2019t need the bench scraper that Frankel used.",
      "The final step is the egg wash, and I chose four different toppings just to try them out: chunky pretzel salt, nigella seeds, Parmesan and cinnamon sugar. They really were ready for baking in the time it took to preheat the oven.",
      "Mine needed a couple of extra minutes on the top rack of the oven to brown enough, but once they were done, I was very happy with the result. I let them sit for about 15 minutes before slicing. (That\u2019s critical for any bread, to avoid a stodgy, gummy crumb when you cut through too soon.) The texture inside is very tender, more moist than your average bagel, and they need toasting to stand up to a spread of butter or cream cheese. The hole is mostly closed, but having it there in the first place allowed for even baking. The outer crust is wonderful \u2014 chewy, crisp in spots, and flavorful. It\u2019s not exactly a bagel shop bagel in terms of texture \u2014 more like an English muffin-bagel \u2014 but for a fresh, breakfast-y roll in 35 minutes flat, I\u2019ll happily call it bagel-adjacent.",
      "I tried using gluten-free flour for the cinnamon one (King Arthur\u2019s Gluten-Free Measure for Measure flour, for the record, but your mileage may vary with other flours), and it\u2019s not as fluffy or chewy, but it worked remarkably well for an unyeasted gluten-free bake. I also tried making separate batches with low-fat grocery-store cottage cheese versus a higher-priced, higher-protein brand, and they worked equally well.",
      "My one complaint is that they spread out rather than up, making for a flattish bagel, but it\u2019s thick enough to allow slicing for a sandwich. I might try baking them in English muffin rings or a jumbo muffin pan next time \u2014 and there definitely will be a next time! \u2014 to see whether that improves the shape without leaving them underdone in the middle. A doughnut pan or parchment cylinders stuck in the holes would maintain shape, too.",
      "Both the bagel I stored overnight in the fridge and the one I sliced and froze kept their character; it might have actually improved the texture a bit, making it slightly drier and more bagel-like. I tried a few different methods of reheating but the most successful was popping them in the toaster right out of the freezer.",
      "The egg wash is important to both appearance and outer texture, and it also gives your chosen toppings some sticktoitiveness. Don\u2019t skip it.",
      "I still think the internet\u2019s obsession with cottage cheese is on the far side of reasonable. A lot of the recipes that lean on it do so for fad-diet street cred, and most of the time, your dietitian is going to be happier if you eat all kinds of real food in moderation. This recipe makes some nutritional sense, though, and it delivers that in record time, with a delicious schmear. What could be better than that?"

      "Back in December, some viewers protested, while others celebrated, after Disney confirmed that references to gender identity had been removed from one character\u2019s story arc.",
      "And last month, after the series premiered on Disney+ on Feb. 19, a scene showing a Christian character openly praying prompted a new round of strong reactions from across the political spectrum.",

      "Read on to learn more about the controversy surrounding \u201cWin or Lose.\u201d",
      "Was a trans character cut from the series?",
      "In December, Disney confirmed it was pulling a transgender storyline from an episode of \u201cWin or Lose.\u201d",
      "The storyline involved a character called Kai, voiced by trans actor Chanel Stewart, who is featured in the show\u2019s seventh episode.",
      "Kai is a star softball player who\u2019s struggling to please her perfectionist dad, according to Disney. She\u2019s also completely dedicated to her team.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s really special is that the Pickles mean a lot to Kai,\u201d director Carrie Hobson said in the show\u2019s production notes. \u201cThat\u2019s visualized in her perspective view as floating \u2014 she literally feels lighter than air. She\u2019s feeling total happiness. It washes over her and lifts her up.\u201d",

      "She also said that when she first landed the role of Kai at age 14, she was excited to play an openly trans character and give kids like her a voice.",
      "\u201cI wore it as a badge. I wore it with pride. I wore it with honor because it meant so much to me,\u201d she told Deadline. \u201cThe thought of authentically portraying a transgender teenage girl made me really happy. I wanted to make this for transgender kids like me.\u201d",
      "Was an openly Christian character added to the show?",
      "While the inclusion of Laurie, an openly Christian character in \u201cWin or Lose,\u201d has been drawing fresh attention recently, Laurie appears to have been part of the series from the beginning.",
      "The show\u2019s first episode centers on Laurie, a 12-year-old member of the Pickles who struggles with anxiety on and off the field.\u00a0She is voiced by Rosie Foss.",

      "But \u201cAnora\u201d isn\u2019t quite so easily boiled down: Thanks to lead actress winner Mikey Madison (Ani) \u2014 and many scenes with her co-star, supporting actor nominee Yura Borisov (Igor) \u2014 it\u2019s clear there\u2019s more to this story.",
      "So what was the movie all about? Why is the final car scene important \u2014 and why does Ani cry? Let\u2019s jump in, kicking and screaming, just like Ani would.",
      "Note: Spoilers for \"Anora\" ahead.",
      "What happens in \u2018Anora\u2019?",
      "Ani works in a strip club, providing exotic dance experiences to the patrons \u2014 and she\u2019s good at what she does.",
      "When the callow young son of a Russian oligarch, Ivan (Mark Edelshteyn), takes a shine to her, they take the party away from the club and discover they like having fun together. He has the money, she\u2019s easy with sex, and they\u2019re just a couple of wild kids enjoying a few days of lust.",
      "That is, until Ivan realizes that if he marries her he can stay in the US and not go back home to be a grown-up, working at his father\u2019s company. Ani is initially unsure, but decides to go for the ride.",
      "They hit Las Vegas and marry in a quickie chapel, continuing the party until his parents get word of what he\u2019s done \u2026 and send thugs to pry the pair apart. This is easier than you\u2019d think, because when Ivan's parents' cronies show up to Ivan\u2019s house, he gives them the slip and leaves Ani to deal with the fallout.",
      "Ani turns into a tiger, refusing to be bound, silenced or told she has to get divorced. While searching for the errant Ivan \u2014 and as his parents fly over from Russia to get the job done \u2014 the thugs, including a sympathetic Igor, haul Ani around New York City trying to find the young man.",
      "In the end, this Cinderella story does not have a happy ending. Ivan\u2019s parents ensure the divorce happens, leaving Ani in a precarious position, her life changed forever.",
      "Why is the final car scene important?",
      "Whether or not you\u2019ve approved of Ani\u2019s choices throughout the film, it\u2019s hard not to admire the way she simply does not give in. She bellows her lungs out, kicks, punches, bites and does whatever she can to try and get away from the thugs who\u2019ve bound her up.",
      "They\u2019re reasonable reasonable thugs, as thugs go: They just want her to sign a divorce agreement, take some hush money, and go away. But for a very long time she\u2019s positive Ivan has no interest in letting her go. Ani \u2014 and Mikey \u2014 truly gives her all.",
      "\u201cI wanted to flip it on its head,\u201d director, writer, editor and producer Sean Baker told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cWe give you a romantic comedy for the first 50 minutes, and we even sandwich it with a quintessential song, Take That\u2019s \u2018The Greatest Day,\u2019 which is maybe a song you would hear in a \u2018Love, Actually\u2019 sort of movie. But then we\u2019re giving you another 90 minutes of reality after that.\u2019\u201d",
      "And after that 90 minutes of reality, Ani is wiped out emotionally and physically. She\u2019d believed that this was going to change her life for the better, and that Ivan could be someone she could be with for the long haul. But he chose not to stand up for her, and she is repeatedly humiliated by his family (at one point, his mom calls her a \"disgusting hooker\").",
      "In the final scene, she\u2019s left in a car with Igor \u2014 the one character who has shown her compassion and has not seen her in a transactional way \u2014 and two important things happen: She breaks down, and they start to become intimate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting to hear other people\u2019s interpretations, because (the ending is) so open-ended, and I\u2019m more curious to hear what other people think \u2014 if they think that the characters will end up together or not, or why they think they end up having sex,\u201d Madison told Interview Magazine.",
      "One interpretation is that Ani uses sex as a way to thank Igor. But when he starts to kiss her, she turns away and starts crying. Sex becomes something that is more than transactional \u2014 and it appears to overwhelm her.",
      "Baker saw the sex in that scene as less transactional and more empowering in an interview with IndieWire.",
      "\"I see (the sex) as being about her and not really something that she\u2019s giving to him but something in which she\u2019s now regaining the power that she lost entirely throughout this journey,\u201d he said.",
      "Why does Ani cry in that car?",
      "Crying before she\u2019s lost everything, before she\u2019s in a safe place, would be a sign of weakness \u2014 as Ani, and undoubtedly the Russians around her \u2014 would see it.",
      "But after everything\u2019s been lost and she\u2019s now around the one person she can feel some level of safe with, Igor, Ani can finally let the tension, the stress, the adrenaline and the anger come pouring out. So she cries.",
      "\u201cYura is such a soulful actor,\u201d Madison said in an interview with Isabelle Huppert for Interview Magazine. \u201cThe whole film, my character has been covering up her emotions with a hardness, not letting anybody see her crack, so I found myself also feeling like that during filming. I was never emotional, and me as Mikey, I\u2019m a very emotional person. For the last scene, I was almost shaking going into the car because I didn\u2019t know what that would feel like \u2014 because I had been feeling the same way as my character for so long.\u201d",
      "The movie ends with Ani in tears, her future, and her connection with Igor, left uncertain. But one thing is for sure: She's back to her old life, though her brush with the world's ultra-rich and ultra-powerful changed her forever."

      "President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to have members of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza killed if hostages are not immediately released.",
      "\"'Shalom Hamas' means Hello and Goodbye \u2014 You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cI have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance,\u201d he added. \u201cAlso, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\u201d",
      "The White House said in a statement that Trump met Wednesday with eight hostages released from Gaza: Iair\u00a0Horn, Omer\u00a0Shem Tov, Eli\u00a0Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama\u00a0Levy, Doron\u00a0Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The administration is engaging in direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Wednesday.",
      "Trump believes the dialogue is part of\u00a0a \"good-faith effort to do what\u2019s right for the American people,\" Leavitt said at a White House news briefing.",
      "\"There are American lives at stake,\" she added, saying Israel had been consulted.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem responded to Trump's comments, telling Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu Agency \"These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation not to implement its terms.\"",
      "\"There is an agreement that was signed and Washington was a mediator in it, which includes the release of all prisoners in 3 stages,\" Qassem added, \"and Hamas has implemented what it was required to do in the first stage, while Israel is evading the second stage.\"",
      "The six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended Saturday with no extension of peace negotiations in sight. It is the first time the United States has held direct talks with the group, which it has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Axios first reported the talks between the United States and Hamas.",
      "Asked whether the scope of the talks included Trump's proposal to take over Gaza, Leavitt said she would not go into details and referred questions to the State Department.",
      "Initially, the idea for a second phase of a ceasefire included Hamas\u2019 releasing more hostages in return for Israel's withdrawing from the Palestinian territory, with the aim of ending the war.",
      "But with no talks continuing, Israel reinstated a halt in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza after the initial phase of the ceasefire ended. Hamas then accused Israel of violating their agreement by \u201cevading the commitment to end the war and withdraw completely from Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israel recently approved a plan from the\u00a0U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0that would have continued the first stage of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover instead of proceeding to the second phase of peace talks.",
      "Witkoff's plan called for the release of half of the\u00a0remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, on the first day and the remaining hostages once a permanent ceasefire deal is reached, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "But Hamas rejected the proposal, saying it didn't honor the original, multiphased ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these positions by the United States strengthened the position of the Zionist right within the government and pushed for taking punitive steps, including closing the crossings in this manner and using the starvation policy against the people of the Gaza Strip,\" the group\u2019s spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said in a statement Sunday.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Sunday that Israel has \"negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "Hughes added that the United States will support Israel's decision on next steps \"given Hamas has indicated it\u2019s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.\"",
      "On Monday, Netanyahu warned Hamas in remarks before the Knesset, Israel's legislature, that if the group didn't release more hostages, \"there will be consequences beyond your imagination. We are preparing for the next stages of the campaign \u2014 not everything is visible, and that\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "The Biden administration announced initial ceasefire in January just days before Trump's inauguration. It required a pause of Israel's military operations in Gaza and the release of both living and dead hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel."

      "Under the $53 billion reconstruction plan proposed by Egypt at an emergency summit in Cairo on Tuesday, Gaza, which has been largely destroyed in Israel's nearly year-and-a-half military offensive in the enclave, would be rebuilt over the span of under six years.",

      "According to local officials, more than 48,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip as a result of Israeli shelling and bombing. Most of the population has also been displaced and more than half of the infrastructure destroyed, including hospitals and schools, according to estimate from the United Nations.",
      "Trump's proposal for the U.S. to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\" sparked outrage across the region and around the world last month, with some analysts warning that his plan to see Palestinians at least temporarily and possibly permanently displaced was tantamount to ethnic cleansing.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry echoed Trump's proposal Tuesday, saying it provided an \"opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will.\"",
      "\"This should be encouraged,\" it added.",
      "While Israeli officials have repeatedly suggested Trump's plan would give Palestinians in Gaza the ability to leave the enclave freely \u2014 something they have not been able to do under Israel and Egypt's nearly two-decade-long blockade on the territory \u2014 it has not expanded on whether they would just as easily be able to regain access to the territory.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry also condemned the Egyptian proposal's plan for a committee of independent Palestinian technocrats to govern Gaza in preparation for the eventual return of the Palestinian Authority, accusing the Fatah-controlled government body of \"corruption\" and \"support for terrorism.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas\u00a0commended the reconstruction plan in a statement, also thanking Trump for his efforts surrounding the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Hamas, which has run the enclave for almost two decades and is a bitter rival of the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the proposal embraced by Arab nations in a statement Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has talked with aides about favoring NATO members that spend a set percentage of their GDP on defense, sources told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is considering a major change\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S.\u2019 participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three current and former senior U.S. officials\u00a0and one congressional official.",
      "Trump has discussed with aides the possibility of calibrating America\u2019s NATO engagement in a way that favors members of the alliance that spend a set percentage of their gross domestic\u00a0product\u00a0on defense, the officials said.",
      "As part of the potential policy shift, the U.S. might not defend a fellow NATO member that is attacked if the country doesn\u2019t meet the defense spending threshold, the officials said. If\u00a0Trump does make that change, it would mark a significant shift from a core tenet of the alliance known as Article 5,\u00a0which says that an attack on any NATO country is an attack on all\u00a0of them.",
      "The president is similarly considering a policy change in which the U.S. may choose to prioritize military exercises with NATO members that are spending the set percentage of their GDPs on defense, the officials said. His administration has already signaled to America\u2019s European allies that the U.S. could reduce its military presence in Europe, and one option now under consideration is to reposition some U.S. troops in the region so they are focused in or around NATO countries that have scaled their defense spending to meet the specific percentage of their GDPs, the officials said.",
      "Asked about Trump considering making these changes to how the U.S. engages with NATO, a National Security Council official said in a written statement, \u201cPresident Trump is committed to NATO and Article V.\u201d",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Defense and a senior senator on the Foreign Relations panel, said Trump\u2019s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, \u201cgave very reassuring answers\u201d on the administration\u2019s commitment to NATO and Article 5.",
      "Trump has repeatedly criticized NATO countries for not meeting the current NATO member goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defense. He has argued that the disparity is unfair and puts an added burden on the U.S.",
      "NATO countries agreed more than a decade ago to set the spending goal for each of them at 2% of GDP. But Trump has pushed to increase that percentage. Most recently he said NATO members should spend 5% of their GDP on defense, though the U.S. does not currently do that.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said in January after taking office. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "According to NATO\u2019s most recent statistics, last year 23 NATO members\u2019 defense spending exceeded 2% of their GDP. Five of those nations\u00a0\u2014 Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Poland and the U.S. \u2014 spent more than 3% on defense.\u00a0Poland\u00a0had the highest percentage,\u00a0dedicating 4.12% of its GDP to defense.",
      "The potential shift in how the U.S. participates in NATO comes as Trump is pushing European allies to do more to aid Ukraine\u00a0in its war with Russia\u00a0and to play a major role in maintaining peace in the country if a\u00a0deal to end the war is reached.",
      "\u201cI was contacted by several European ambassadors concerned about rumors that Trump might make some negative announcement about NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday. Trump didn\u2019t announce anything at his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, but Coons said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not given pause by everything about President Trump\u2019s statements and actions on foreign policy, you\u2019re not paying attention.\u201d",
      "Trump threatened to withdraw\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0from NATO during his first term and has questioned the merits of Article\u00a05\u00a0for the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0The article was designed to protect European nations from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It has been triggered just once, after the\u00a09/11\u00a0attacks on the U.S.",
      "Ukraine has sought NATO membership, but the Trump administration has said that would not be part of any negotiated peace deal."

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine may have enough weapons to fight Russia unaffected for a few weeks at least, but President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to stop sharing intelligence will cost civilian lives almost immediately, dismayed Ukrainians said Thursday.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to halt intelligence came as European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy, convened a\u00a0summit in Brussels as they attempt to cope with an upended landscape in which the Trump administration appears to be treating them with hostility while seemingly warming to the Kremlin.",
      "Miles away from these high-powered meetings, ordinary Ukrainians may have to confront the real-world consequences of the White House\u2019s U-turn.",
      "As Washington turns off the tap on its $65 billion of military aid, Ukraine will also now have to do without American intelligence that has helped it to anticipate Russian attacks and troop movements, and avoid nightly barrages from Russian drones on its cities and infrastructure.",
      "Viewed from the homes and apartments of Kyiv, it seems like \u201ca very petty decision by our alleged ally,\u201d said Myroslava Yeremkiv, 33, who manages donations at a nongovernmental organization in the capital. \u201cThe United States has the power at least to protect and save the lives of civilians from Russia\u2019s brutal and terrorizing attacks \u2026 and you just choose not to.\u201dThe White House cut off this intel feed following the disastrous Oval Office meeting last week between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy. Though Trump\u2019s team hinted that the pause is a negotiating tactic to ensure Zelenskyy is \u201cready for peace,\u201d it has nonetheless shocked military and intelligence experts worldwide.",
      "That feeling is no less deeply felt in Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThis looks like a thug tactic \u2014 blackmailing and trying to break Ukrainian society into submission before negotiations,\u201d Yeremkiv said, calling it a \u201cvery weak and pathetic decision.\u201d",
      "In some of the first practical consequences of that rupture, U.S. shipments of weapons and equipment already en-route to Ukraine were halted Monday night, a U.S. defense official told NBC News. So immediate was that order, that planes carrying vital aid for the Ukrainian war effort turned around in the sky, they added.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope that in the near future we can restore sharing of this information,\u201d said Oleksandr Musiienko, head of the Kyiv-based Center for Military and Legal Studies. \u201cWe will lose some types of information about flying warplanes from Russian airfields, about launching their terrorist attacks,\u201d added Musiienko, who also serves in the country\u2019s Territorial Defense Forces. \u201cThis means that we do not have enough security and defense for our civilians.\u201dThe U.S. is not the only country providing military aid and intelligence. But it is by far Ukraine\u2019s largest single contributor of both. It will \u201cbe extremely difficult to fully compensate for this loss with our own capabilities or those of Europe,\u201d according to Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukraine government-backed think tank.",
      "Despite Moscow having the upper hand, Ukraine has slowed or even halted Russia\u2019s grinding winter advances. Kyiv has managed to shoot down most of the hundreds of Russian drones fired almost nightly at civilian targets in cities. That\u2019s partly down to $64 billion in American military assistance and $66 billion provided by all other countries combined, fueling Ukraine\u2019s fighting spirit that confounded predictions of swift Russian victory.",
      "At the European Union summit Thursday, Zelenskyy thanked the Europeans, who unlike Trump have committed to Kyiv\u2019s unconditional defense, which they see as a bulwark against wider Russian aggression. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we are not alone,\u201d he told his fellow leaders.",
      "Some of this money covers intelligence, with U.S. know-how helping the Ukrainians to wield American-supplied materiel such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, commonly known as HIMARS, and the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.Away from the battlefield, the decision to pull the plug \u2014 and\u00a0pull it so publicly \u2014 will send shock waves\u00a0through America\u2019s intelligence partners around the world, former officials said.",
      "\u201cThe signal it sends is atrocious,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA officer. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is not a dependable ally.\u201d",
      "This message will also be heard loud and clear in Moscow.",
      "\u201cEvery day that passes without a solution can be costly for Ukraine, particularly if Russia decides to exploit this weakness,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst who is the head of intelligence at the Le Beck consultancy.",

      "\u201cThis is, of course, a threat\u201d against\u00a0Russia, Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow.",
      "\u201cUnlike their predecessors, who also wanted to fight against\u00a0Russia, Napoleon, Hitler, Mr. Macron does not act very gracefully, because at least they said it bluntly: \u2018we must conquer\u00a0Russia, we must defeat\u00a0Russia\u2019.\u201d",
      "Lavrov also dismissed European ideas about sending peacekeepers from NATO member states to Ukraine, saying that Moscow would consider such a deployment to be a NATO presence in Ukraine and that Moscow would not allow it.",
      "Russia\u00a0and the United States are by far the world\u2019s biggest nuclear powers, with more than 5,000 nuclear warheads each, followed by China with about 500 and then France with 290 and the United Kingdom with 225, according to the\u00a0Federation of American Scientists.",
      "Russian officials say the tough rhetoric from Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other European powers over recent days is simply not backed up by hard military power and point to\u00a0Russia\u2019s advances on the battlefield in Ukraine.",
      "Putin last year ordered the regular size of the\u00a0Russian army to be increased by 180,000 troops to 1.5 million active servicemen in a move that would make it the second largest in the world after China\u2019s.",
      "Putin has repeatedly dismissed as nonsense Western claims that\u00a0Russia\u00a0could one day attack a NATO member.",
      "Ukraine and the West say Putin is engaged in an imperial-style land grab in Ukraine, and have repeatedly vowed to defeat\u00a0Russia, which currently controls just under 20% of Ukraine, including Crimea and a chunk of eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "Putin portrays the war as part of a historic struggle with the West, which he says humiliated\u00a0Russia, after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.",
      "New ambassador",
      "Putin appointed\u00a0Alexander Darchiev, a\u00a0veteran diplomat\u00a0known in the past for public denunciations of the West,\u00a0as\u00a0ambassador\u00a0to the United States on Thursday to lead a rapprochement\u00a0that has\u00a0stunned Ukraine and European\u00a0countries.",
      "The Foreign Ministry\u00a0said\u00a0last week Washington had given it the green light at a meeting between Russian and U.S. officials in Turkey to appoint Darchiev, who now serves as head of the\u00a0ministry\u2019s\u00a0North America department.",
      "The\u00a0six-hour meeting in Istanbul last Thursday, where the delegations worked to try to restore\u00a0the normal\u00a0functioning\u00a0of their embassies\u00a0after years of\u00a0tit-for-tat expulsions, was the latest sign of a thaw between the two countries.",
      "Trump has upended previous policy on the war in Ukraine, opening up bilateral talks with Moscow and pausing military aid to Kyiv after clashing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House last week.",
      "Russia has had no\u00a0ambassador\u00a0in Washington since last October when the previous envoy, Anatoly Antonov, left his post.",
      "Darchiev, 64, has served two long spells in Russia\u2019s Washington embassy and was\u00a0ambassador\u00a0to Canada from 2014 to 2021.\u00a0Like other senior Russian diplomats, he has been known in recent years for strong public denunciations of the United States and the West.",
      "\u201cApparently, Washington will need time to get used to the fact that its hegemony is in the past, and will have to reckon with the national interests of Russia, which has its own sphere of influence and responsibility,\u201d he told Interfax in March 2022.",
      "In a memoir, John J. Sullivan, a U.S.\u00a0ambassador\u00a0to Russia under then-President Joe Biden, described Darchiev becoming \u201cvisibly enraged\u201d during a meeting at the Foreign Ministry in Moscow, over remarks by Biden, who called Putin a war criminal.",
      "\u201cWhen I finished, he started screaming at me in a profane tirade that I should not come into the ministry with such a belligerent attitude,\u201d Sullivan wrote. Sullivan declined further comment on the events when contacted by Reuters, and Reuters was not able to reach Darchiev for his side of the story."

      "Thursday marked day 144 of the trial against\u00a0Lai\u00a0and his 52nd day in the witness box, after which he thanked the judges and waved to his supporters.",
      "Lai, 77, founder of the Apple Daily newspaper that was forced to close after a police raid and asset freeze in June 2021, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of\u00a0conspiracy to collude with foreign forces, and a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material.",
      "Lai, whose\u00a0health is fragile\u00a0according to his family, faces a possible life sentence under a China-imposed national security law. Some countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have called for his immediate release alleging the trial is political.",
      "Lai\u2019s plight has become a friction point between the U.S. and China, with President Donald Trump saying he would \u201cone hundred percent\u201d get\u00a0Lai\u00a0out of the country.",
      "Over weeks of testimony,\u00a0Lai\u00a0spoke candidly on topics including his defense of free speech and the media, while\u00a0rejecting allegations\u00a0by the prosecution that he had lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.",
      "He also remained defiant in the face of intense cross-examination. In one exchange he called himself a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d only for one judge, Esther Toh, to reject that and say\u00a0Lai\u00a0was in court to face a criminal charge.\u00a0Lai\u00a0said he had the right to disagree.",
      "Before concluding his cross-examination, prosecutor Anthony Chau read out the three charges, alleged conspiracies and co-conspirators, and asked\u00a0Lai\u00a0if he agreed with them.",
      "\u201cOf course I disagree. Totally rubbish,\u201d\u00a0Lai\u00a0said.",
      "Lai\u00a0added that he did not even know one of the alleged co-conspirators, Andy Li.",

      "No firm date has been set for a verdict, but a judge recently indicated it could come in October."
