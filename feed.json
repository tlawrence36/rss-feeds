      "Historian Ron Chernow\u2019s latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant",
      "NEW YORK -- Historian Ron Chernow's latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant.",
      "The 1,200-page \u201cMark Twain\u201d will be published next week. It's Chernow's first release since his Grant biography came out in 2017, and the first time he has taken on a literary writer after a career defined by celebrated books about business leaders (John D. Rockefeller, the Morgan dynasty), presidents (Grant and Washington) and, most of all, Alexander Hamilton. His many honors include the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cWashington: A Life,\u201d the National Book Award for \u201cThe House of Morgan\u201d and the National Book Critics Circle prize for \u201cTitan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.\u201d",
      "But a book on Twain had been in his thoughts for decades, dating back to when he saw Hal Holbrook play him on stage in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cAnd there he was, with the white suit and cigar and mustache and he was tossing out one hilarious line after another,\u201d the 76-year-old Chernow says, remembering such Twain quips as \u201cThere's no distinctly Native American criminal class, except Congress.\u201d Chernow became fascinated by Twain as a prototype of the modern celebrity and found himself drawn less to \u201cMark Twain the novelist than the pundit, the personality and the platform artist.\u201d",
      "Chernow admittedly is more comfortable with the researchable world of facts than with the more intangible qualities of the imagination. But he found much to identify with Twain, relating to him as a fellow widower (Twain outlived his wife, Olivia, by six years; Chernow's wife, Valerie Stearn, died in 2006), as a public speaker and as an author fortunate enough to write full time.",
      "Chernow also looks closely into subjects familiar to him \u2014 politics and finance, notably the various failed business ventures that left Twain short of money despite his author royalties and the inherited wealth of his wife. Toward the end of the book, the historian addresses the friendships an elderly Twain cultivated with teen and preteen girls, whom Twain called his \u201cangelfish.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the time Twain\u2019s behavior was regarded as the charming eccentricity of a beloved humorist with a soft spot for children. We look at that same behavior today and find it odd and disturbing. It's important to get both perspectives,\u201d Chernow says. \u201cTwain\u2019s behavior was chaste and none of the angelfish or their parents ever accused him of improper or predatory behavior. At the same time, there was such an obsessive quality about Twain\u2019s attention to these teenage girls \u2014 he devoted more time to them than to his own daughters.\u201d",
      "During a recent interview at his Upper West Side Manhattan apartment, where his glass of Diet Coke stood on a coaster illustrated with a sketch of Twain receiving an honorary college degree, Chernow also reflected on Twain's family, his politics and the sadness in his soul. Chernow's comments have been condensed for clarity and brevity.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what he would say about Donald Trump. I could, yes, but I don\u2019t want to guess. But we do know what he said about political figures of his own day. And he hated Teddy Roosevelt. He saw that Teddy Roosevelt had a very large ego, very self-absorbed and a Mr. Bombastic personality. But he (Twain) has a wonderful quote where he says that Teddy Roosevelt is the Tom Sawyer of the political world of the early 20th century. He said that he was always hunting for attention. And then he has this great line. He said that in his (Roosevelt's) frenzied imagination, the great republic is one vast Barnum\u2019s circus, and he is the clown, and the whole world is his audience.\u201d",
      "To actually read about the children of famous personalities is almost invariably sad, as it often is with Mark Twain. The one who suffered from this most acutely, I think was the middle daughter, Clara, who was kind of insanely competitive with her father and felt overshadowed by him, wanted to kind of trade on his reputation, but then didn\u2019t want him to get the attention. She said that she would be in a room with her father, and she felt she was only Mark Twain\u2019s daughter, that she was reduced to the level of a footstool. And she also had a very interesting line, one that has a very contemporary ring: He would come into the room and he would flood the room with talk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's that time when he goes to the Sandwich Islands and he meets the American diplomat Anson Burlingame, who advises him to \u201ccultivate your betters,\u201d which Twain really takes to heart. I think that with Twain, if someone asks me, you know, did he marry Olivia for her money? I would say definitely not. It was a true love match. And as Twain said late in life, there was not a single day of his marriage that she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I worship you,\u2019 \u2018I idolize you.\u2019 This was just kind of pouring out of her and her letters. On the other hand, the more you know about Mark Twain, the more you know that he could never have married a poor woman.",
      "\u201cAnd the irony of Twain\u2019s life is that he spends his entire life attacking the plutocrats on the one hand, and on the other, he\u2019s doing everything in his power to become one. This man embodies in his person every tendency of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of self-loathing in him. I have a quote later in the book \u2014 he says that (poet Lord) Byron detested life because he detested himself. Twain said, \u2018I\u2019m the same way.\u2019 You know, that's a really harsh, harsh thing to say. But I think that he saw all these impulses within himself that he was really powerless to stop. And then he realized he hurt other people. I think that Mark Twain did fit the stereotype of the funny man who\u2019s sad and depressed under the surface and is kind of releasing that through the humor.\u201d",

      "Robert De Niro will receive an honorary Palme d\u2019Or next week at the Cannes Film Festival, a culmination for the 81-year-old actor whose history with the French film festival stretches back half a century",
      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Robert De Niro will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a culmination for the 81-year-old actor whose history with the French film festival stretches back half a century.",
      "In 1976, De Niro starred in two films \u2014 Martin Scorsese's \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and Bernardo Bertolucci's \u201c1900\" \u2014 that premiered in competition at Cannes. \u201cTaxi Driver\" was an immediate sensation, and went home with the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or.",
      "Since then, De Niro has been a regular on the Croisette, returning with \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d in 1983, Sergio Leone's \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America\u201d in 1984 and Roland Joff\u00e9's \u201cThe Mission\u201d in 1986. Joff\u00e9's film also won the Palme, making De Niro the rare actor to star in two Palme d'Or winners.",
      "Though De Niro helps run his own film festival back in New York, the Tribeca Festival, he has remained a mainstay in Cannes. He presided over the jury in 2011 that selected Terrence Malick's \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d for the Palme. Most recently, he and Scorsese returned to premiere \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,\" De Niro said when his honorary Palme d'Or was announced last month. \u201cEspecially now when there\u2019s so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together \u2014 storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It\u2019s like coming home.\u201d",
      "De Niro is to receive the award in the festival's opening ceremony on May 13.",

      "The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been postponed until early next week",
      "NEW YORK -- The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was postponed until early next week, right before opening arguments begin, a federal judge decided on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Combs, 55, used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024. He pleaded not guilty after his September arrest and has remained held without bail at a federal lockup in Brooklyn.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian granted a request by defense lawyers to delay until Monday the final step in the jury selection process, expected to last less than an hour. Prosecutors unsuccessfully objected.",
      "The possible jurors were not present on Friday as federal prosecutors and lawyers assembled in a Manhattan courtroom, with Combs also present, to narrow a pool of 45 prospective jurors down to a jury of 12 and six alternates who will hear the two-month trial.",
      "For three days this week, would-be jurors had been asked questions to help the judge and lawyers determine if they could be fair and impartial. And they were also questioned to ensure they could decide the case on the facts even after seeing explicit videos of sexual activity that some might find disturbing.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors will be permitted to strike six prospective jurors from the jury while defense lawyers were allowed 10 strikes before the jury is finalized. Generally, lawyers do not have to explain why they are ejecting individuals from the panel. The process was expected to take up to an hour.",
      "If Combs is convicted on all charges, which include racketeering, kidnapping, arson, bribery and sex trafficking, he would face a mandatory 15 years in prison and could remain behind bars for life.",
      "Prosecutors allege that the Bad Boy Records founder used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024.",
      "An indictment includes descriptions of \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d drugged-up orgies in which women were forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.",
      "The charges against him also portray Combs as abusive to his victims, sometimes choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "His lawyers contend that prosecutors are trying to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. They concede that Combs had abused various substances but say he has undergone treatment.",
      "A centerpiece of the evidence against him are recordings of Combs beating a longtime girlfriend in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.",
      "After a video of the encounter aired on CNN last year, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d",
      "Numerous prospective jurors interviewed by the judge this week said they had seen the video and some were deemed to be too affected by it to be impartial and remain in the jury pool.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former model tearfully testified Thursday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point.",
      "Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, an aspiring actor at the time, told jurors at Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial that the onetime movie honcho put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at a Manhattan apartment in 2002.",
      "Sokola said she saw Weinstein\u2019s eyes \u2014 \u201cblack and scary\u201d \u2014 staring at her in a bathroom mirror as it happened.",
      "Afterward, she said, he told her to keep quiet about what had happened, touting that he'd made the careers of A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and that he could help her Hollywood dreams come true.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never been in a situation like this,\u201d Sokola testified, as riveted jurors scribbled notes. \u201cI felt stupid and ashamed and like it\u2019s my fault for putting myself in this position.\u201d",
      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",

      "\u201cEvery musician\u2019s dream in the early '60s was to make it big in the U.S. charts,\" Daltrey said. \u201cFor The Who, that dream came true in 1967 and our lives were changed forever.\u201d",
      "The band went from performing club shows to headlining the Woodstock festival in the U.S. and becoming one of the biggest box-office draw in the world. The band were inducted into the Rock n\u2019 Roll Hall Of Fame in 1990.",
      "Daltrey, 81, and Townshend, two years his junior, have been one of rock's most prolific double acts, surviving the deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1978 and bass guitarist John Entwistle in 2002.",

      "\u201cI really did make the music that I needed for my grieving process, for just the place that I\u2019m at in my life right now,\u201d she says of the album out Friday.",
      "\u201cSincerely,\u201d (yes, the title includes the comma) began as a collection of letters to herself, friends and loved ones but took on a deeper meaning as the Colombian American songwriter gave birth to her first child and processed her mother's recent death. The first single, \u201cSunshine & Rain...,\u201d includes a clip of Uchis' mother saying, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to immortalize her in the project,\u201d said Uchis. \u201cI thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album.\u201d",
      "The 14-track album finds Uchis proudly wearing her heart on her sleeve with songs like \u201cDaggers!,\u201d where Uchis encourages a close friend to lean into self-love, or \u201cILYSMIH,\u201d which includes baby coos at the beginning and was written as she lay in her hospital bed with her newborn.",
      "Uchis hopes that after listening to her fifth full album, fans will feel more connected to themselves and more in touch with their emotions: \u201cI hope it will give them some type of solace.\"",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "UCHIS: I\u2019m a very deep feeler. I\u2019m very empathetic. I feel a lot. And I wanted to make a body of work that fully showed that vulnerability and that actually really dug deep into my heart in a way that none of my other albums ever had.",
      "I felt like I was ready to do that because I\u2019ve been making music long enough that I felt that it was that time for me, and then it just so happened that, shortly after working on the album, I became pregnant, which was such a big part of being able to feel even deeper than I ever have.",
      "UCHIS: It\u2019s crazy because a lot of times I feel, and especially with this album in particular, I felt that I really made music that my future self would need, that I didn\u2019t realize I was going to need at that time.",
      "The album is actually dedicated to my mom. My mom later ended up getting diagnosed, and she\u2019s no longer here. ... And so pretty much all of the songs ended up taking on a deeper meaning to me because of that and because of it being dedicated to her. ... At the time, I might not have even realized subconsciously that I was making all of this to heal myself.",
      "UCHIS: At one point, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure each of these songs is like, this is my letter to the world, this is my letter to this person, this my letter to that, this one to myself.\u201d I tried to really conceptualize in a different way that I never have when making any other album. And then ... when my mom passed, a lot of what I had left from her is letters that she wrote to me, and so it ended up, like I said, just more and more reasons for me to realize that it was the correct title for the project.",
      "UCHIS: I never stick to one process, but one particular process that stuck out to me on a lot of the songs was that most of them were written with no music, just songs that came to me.",
      "For instance, \u201cILYSMIH\u201d \u2014 that one literally I was just recovering from labor, my son was sleeping next to me; I was still in my hospital bed when I got this idea for this song and started it, started recording it on my phone, started writing some lyrics down. ... There\u2019s one called \u201cAll I Can Say.\u201d I wrote that whole song in the car on the way to the studio. ... I try to just make beauty out of all of my experiences.",
      "UCHIS: Thematically, nature is kind of a reoccurring theme in my music because I am so inspired by nature and I feel nature is where God exists and nature is where a lot of my creativity just thrives.",
      "I feel like it just happened. Afterwards, I even thought, \u201cIs this too similar to what I\u2019ve already done?\u201d But \u2026 I just love the things that I love, and I just returned back to those nostalgic elements. I may branch out and try what people think is different sounds. Like on \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas,\u201d I did a lot of different genre-bending on \u201cSin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)\" as well, but to me, that\u2019s still nostalgic because it\u2019s still music I grew up listening to.",
      "I return a lot to things that are core memories for me. It\u2019s soothing to my nervous system. I\u2019m the person who watches the same episodes of my favorite TV shows over and over again, ... I think that\u2019s what makes it beautiful too, is to see the evolution and know that it\u2019s still true to me. It's still true to my roots in music and where I started, but an evolved version.",
      "UCHIS: After she passed, one of the first things I did was go through all of the audio messages that she had ever sent me and I was just listening to all her messages over and over, wanting to hear her voice. When I heard that one I just thought of, \u201cOh how perfect is this that the song is called \u2018Sunshine &Rain...,\u2019 and she had said, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d It was for my son that she sent that message. I thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album, considering that it\u2019s dedicated to her.",
      "I struggled a lot with whether or not I wanted to share because I\u2019m a very, very private person. So I struggled a lot with if I even wanted to share that my mom was no longer here, but I felt I just had to not be afraid of that vulnerability and not pretend like it didn\u2019t affect me or didn\u2019t have some type of impact on me when it had such a big impact on me and still does. And I wanted to also honor her and honor her life in a way through art that I know that she would have loved and that she would have been proud of.",

    "story": [
      "A scrappy opera company that started 11 years ago in New York City is thriving by staying small",
      "NEW YORK -- Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance \u2014 in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people.",
      "\u201cWe did Kurt Weill\u2019s \u2018The Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin,\u201d recalled Schlosberg, the company\u2019s music director and one of its founders.",
      "They named their company Heartbeat Opera, \u201cfrom the idea that singers would be feet away from you,\u201d Schlosberg said. \u201cAnd so you would be experiencing their voices at arm\u2019s length and that would make a resonance in your heart.\u201d",
      "Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million.",
      "But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200.",
      "\u201cVery few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale,\u201d said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeat\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe don\u2019t do small opera. We do big opera in a small space.\u201d",
      "And despite its success with critics and audiences \u2014 performances regularly sell out \u2014 the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule.",
      "There\u2019s typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians.",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly \u2014 a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse.",
      "\u201cGrowth itself shouldn\u2019t be a goal. Excellence should be a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they don\u2019t overstretch and overstep.\u201d",
      "Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesn\u2019t focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises \u201cincisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d in 2017.",
      "\u201cTheir approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world,\u201d she said, \u201cwithout falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, \u2018Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here\u2019.\u201d",
      "For Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFidelio,\u201d Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composer\u2019s own sexuality.",
      "And for Richard Strauss\u2019 \u201cSalome\u201d this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s casting for \u201cSalome\u201d reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability.",
      "Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that \u201ca big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent,\u201d he said.",
      "Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first \u201cbecause I had never done a role like this where I am the title character.",
      "\u201cI was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most striking aspect of this \u201cSalome\u201d was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s final local offering of the season will be Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust,\u201d to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25.",
      "\u201cI had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories,\u201d said Holdren, who is directing the production. \u201cAnd I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off.\u201d",
      "She sees Mephistopheles less as a \u201dmustache-twirling villain\u201d and more as \u201ca figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that there\u2019s an opening for him.\u201d",
      "Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. It\u2019s the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration.",
      "That task fell to Francisco Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct.",
      "Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cVanessa\u201d at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited by what they\u2019ve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times,\" said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival.",
      "For Heartbeat\u2019s debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. It\u2019s in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",

      "Smokey Robinson\u2019s lawyer says allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Smokey Robinson's lawyer said allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\" and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "Attorney Christopher Frost said in a statement Wednesday that the evidence \u201cwill show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.\u201d",
      "The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday against the Motown music luminary seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024. Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, is also named as a defendant for allegedly enabling his behavior and creating an abusive work environment.",
      "\u201cWe will be addressing the numerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies, and relationships between the plaintiffs and others,\u201d Frost's statement said.",
      "The four women each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them over their objections, in some cases for many years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,\u201d the women\u2019s attorney John Harris said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. The women, whose names are withheld in the lawsuit, appeared with their lawyers at the news conference. They didn't speak, and they covered their faces with masks.",
      "Frost called the news conference \u201cbizarre theatrics,\u201d and an attempt to \u201cenlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create. We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\u201d",
      "One woman said that she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said that she worked for him from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times.",
      "All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. The same fears have kept the women from going to police to report Robinson, their lawyers said, though they also said they believe criminal investigation is warranted.",
      "The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations.",
      "Frost said that Robinson would soon address the allegations himself, and that they would be asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s as a central part of the Motown Records machine \u2014 both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including \u201cTears of a Clown\" and \u201cThe Tracks of My Tears.\"",

      "Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations.",
      "As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.",
      "The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors.",
      "In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.",
      "The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006.",
      "Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.",
      "She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.",
      "Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2014 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2014 but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.",
      "She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.",
      "Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.",
      "They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility\u201d of other accusers.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

Looking for any tips you can give me \u2014 especially on my backswing and follow-through.\"",
      "Kelce said the early feedback was \u201ccrazy.\"",
      "\u201cSome of this stuff is like stuff other pros have put out and it's kind of generic stuff that everybody can use,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut there's been some stuff so far that's been like, \u2018Holy cow, I never thought about it like that.' So I'm excited about that.\u201d",
      "Kelce \u2014 who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp. Panzer asked Kelce about his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast that he tapes with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",
      "\u201cThe ability of players to connect with fans directly has never been greater,\u201d Kelce told Panzer.",

He accepted gifts, too, including a Kelly green Eagles beer koozie. One fan who called himself T-Shirt Phil \u2014 did we mention the tourney was near Philly? \u2014 said he wanted to introduce Kelce to Phillies slugger Nick Castellanos.",

      "\u201cThe course is in great shape,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. All the guys we played with agreed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guys\u201d included PGA pros Stephan Jager and Shane Lowry.",

      "\u201cWe were talking beforehand like, \u2018Man, wouldn\u2019t it be great to get hit by Jason Kelce's ball?' And then he shot it over the green,\u201d Mokrejs said. \u201cI was talking and all of a sudden I hear, \u2018Look out!\u2019 I turned and it just smacked me in the hand. I covered my hand. I didn't spill my drink. I had a Transfusion. Classic golf drink, you know what I mean? Chugged that real quick to get me healthy.\u201d",
      "Kelce noted the serene golf atmosphere made for more \u201cGo Birds\u201d chants more than the popular \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S\u201d chant that punctuates the Eagles\u2019 fight song.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so quick,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThe \u2018E-A-G-L-E-S\u2019 you\u2019ve got start in halfway through. Someone\u2019s got to get it going.\u201d",

      "The 2026 PGA Championship will be held at Aronimink Golf Club in Newtown Square and the 2030 U.S. Open is at Merion Golf Club.",
      "\u201cPhilly is an unbelievable golf hub,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cThere's a lot of fans in the game. There's a lot of incredible courses with a lot of history to it.\u201d",

      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",

      "Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done.",
      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch (10-centimeter-by-10-centimeter) piece of lumber.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur whose wildly successful career has been dotted by allegations of violence, will be brought to a New York courthouse Monday to be tried on charges that he used the influence and resources of his business empire to sexually abuse women. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the morning and potentially take several days. Opening statements by the lawyers and the start of testimony is expected next week.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs reads like a charging document filed against a Mafia leader or the head of a drug gang, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "The indictment says that with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses, Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others.",
      "Women were manipulated into participating in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "To keep women in line, prosecutors say Combs used a mix of influence and violence: He offered to boost their entertainment careers if they did what he asked \u2014 or cut them off if they didn't.",
      "And when he wasn't getting what he wanted, the indictment says Combs and his associates resorted to violent acts including beatings, kidnapping and arson. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "Combs and his lawyers say he is innocent.",
      "Any group sex was consensual, they say. There was no effort to coerce people into things they didn't want to do, and nothing that happened amounted to a criminal racket, they said.",
      "The trial is expected to take at least eight weeks.",
      "Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, a security camera recorded him beating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassie filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.",

      "The trial is the latest and most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.",
      "In 1999 he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.",
      "Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the incident at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal \u201cShyne\u201d Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",
      "Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.",
      "Now, Combs faces his most serious case yet.",
      "If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.",

    "story": [
      "Jacques Agbobly has only been in the fashion business for five years",
      "NEW YORK -- When the email came from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Jacques Agbobly at first didn\u2019t quite believe it.",
      "The Brooklyn-based fashion designer had only been in the business for five years. Now, one of the world\u2019s top museums was asking for two of his designs to be shown in \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d the exhibit launched by the starry Met Gala.",
      "\u201cI was just floored with excitement,\u201d Agbobly said in an interview. \u201cI had to check to make sure it was from an official email. And then the excitement came, and I was like \u2026 am I allowed to say anything to anyone about it?\u201d",
      "Agbobly grew up in Togo, watching seamstresses and tailors create beautiful garments in part of the family home that they rented out. Studying fashion later in New York, the aspiring designer watched the Met Gala carpet from afar and dreamed of one day somehow being part of it.",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Costume Institute exhibit to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear. Unlike past shows that highlighted the work of very famous designers like Karl Lagerfeld or Charles James, this exhibit includes a number of up-and-coming designers like Agbobly.",
      "\u201cThe range is phenomenal,\u201d says guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard College professor whose book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d is a foundation for the show.",
      "\u201cIt's super exciting to showcase the designs of these younger and emerging designers,\u201d says Miller, who took The Associated Press through the show over the weekend before its unveiling at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cand to see the way they've been thinking about Black representation across time and across geography.\u201d",
      "The exhibit covers Black style over several centuries, but the unifying theme is dandyism, and how designers have expressed that ethos through history.",
      "For Agbobly, dandyism is \u201cabout taking space. As a Black designer, as a queer person, a lot of it is rooted in people telling us who we should be or how we should act \u2026 dandyism really goes against that. It\u2019s about showing up and looking your best self and taking up space and announcing that you're here.\u201d",
      "The exhibit, which opens to the public May 10, begins with its own definition: someone who \u201cstudies above everything else to dress elegantly and fashionably.\u201d",
      "Miller has organized it into 12 conceptual sections: Ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "The \u201cownership\u201d section begins with two livery coats worn by enslaved people.",
      "One of them, from Maryland, looks lavish and elaborate, in purple velvet trimmed with gold metallic threading. The garments were intended to show the wealth of their owners. In other words, Miller says, the enslaved themselves were items of conspicuous consumption.",
      "The other is a livery coat of tan broadcloth, likely manufactured by Brooks Brothers and worn by an enslaved child or adolescent boy in Louisiana just before the Civil War.",
      "Elsewhere, there's a contemporary, glittering ensemble by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, made of crushed silk velvet and embroidered with crystals and the cowrie shells historically used as currency in Africa.",
      "There's also a so-called \u201cdollar bill suit\u201d by the label 3.Paradis \u2014 the jacket sporting a laminated one-dollar bill stitched to the breast pocket, meant to suggest the absence of wealth.",
      "The \u201cdisguise\u201d section includes a collection of 19th-century newspaper ads announcing rewards for catching runaway enslaved people.",
      "The ads, Miller notes, would often describe someone who was \u201cparticularly fond of dress\u201d \u2014 or note that the person had taken large wardrobes. The reason was twofold: The fancy clothes made it possible for an enslaved person to cloak their identity. But also, when they finally made it to freedom, they could sell the clothing to help fund their new lives, Miller says.",
      "\u201cSo dressing above one\u2019s station sometimes was a matter of life and death,\u201d the curator says, \u201cand also enabled people to transition from being enslaved to being liberated.\u201d",
      "The contemporary part of this section includes striking embroidered jackets by the label Off-White that purposely play with gender roles \u2014 like displaying an ostensibly \u201cmale\u201d jacket on a female mannequin.",
      "Stopping by a set of portraits from the early 19th century, as abolitionism was happening in the North, Miller explains that the subjects are Black men who were successful, well off enough to commission or sit for portraits, and dressed \u201cin the finest fashions of the day.\u201d Like William Whipper, an abolitionist and wealthy lumber merchant who also founded a literary society.",
      "They represent the beginnings of a Black middle and upper middle class in America, Miller says. But she points out a group of racist caricatures in a case right across from the portraits.",
      "\u201cAlmost as soon as they are able to do this,\u201d she says, referring to the portraits, \u201cthey are stereotyped and degraded.\u201d",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Lady Gaga gave a free concert Saturday night in front of 2 million fans who poured onto Copacabana Beach for the biggest show of her career.",
      "\u201cTonight, we're making history. (...) Thank you for making history with me,\u201d Lady Gaga told a screaming crowd.",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show at around 22:10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \u201cBloody Mary.\u201d Cries of joy rose from the tightly-packed fans who sang and danced shoulder-to-shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show.",
      "Lady Gaga performed her classic hits, including \u201cPoker Face\u201d and \u201cAlejandro,\u201d switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans - many of them young - arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\u201cToday is the best day of my life,\u201d said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \u201cIt's surreal to be here.\u201d",
      "Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year.",
      "The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Years\u2019 Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John\u2019s Day celebrations in June.",
      "\u201cIt brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season \u2013 filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\u201d said Osmar Lima, the city\u2019s secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall\u2019s tourism department last month.",

      "Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028.",
      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio\u2019s metro employees danced to Lady Gaga\u2019s 2008 hit song \u201cLoveGame\u201d and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",
      "More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio\u2019s City Hall said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, made a cross-continent trip from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,\u201d said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga\u2019s outlandish costumes over the years.",
      "For her, the mega-star represents \u201ctotal freedom of expression - being who one wants without shame.\u201d",
      "Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna\u2019s show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year\u2019s Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state\u2019s security plan included the presence of 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers, and 400 military firefighters.",
      "Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues.",
      "Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait.",
      "\u201cShe's the best artist in the world,\u201d the 25-year-old said, as chants of \u201cGaga, I love you\u201d in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "LUSAKA, Zambia -- The United States will cut $50 million worth of aid a year to the southern African country of Zambia because of the \u201csystematic\" theft of medicines and medical supplies the money paid for, the U.S. ambassador said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. had discovered in 2021 that medicines and supplies that were meant to be provided free to Zambians had been taken and were being sold by pharmacies across the country, U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said at a press briefing.",
      "He said that an investigation of around 2,000 pharmacies in Zambia between 2021 and 2023 found that nearly half of them were selling medicines and products paid for by U.S. aid funds.",
      "The Zambian government had failed to do enough to address the corruption after the U.S. informed it of the theft scandal in April 2024, Gonzales said.",
      "There was no immediate government comment Thursday.",
      "The $50 million is part of $128 million the U.S. gives to Zambia a year for medicines, medical supplies and other support for its health sector. Gonzales said the cuts would affect medications for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, three critical diseases affecting Zambians.",
      "\u201cThe United States is taking necessary steps to safeguard, and ensure the accountability of, American taxpayer funds,\u201d Gonzales said.",
      "The action was separate to President Donald Trump's decision to cut U.S. foreign aid across the world, Gonzales said.",
      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

      "Cancer before age 50 is rare, but increasing, in the United States and researchers want to know why.",
      "A new government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, finding that the largest increases are in breast, colorectal, kidney and uterine cancers. Scientists from the National Cancer Institute looked at data that included more than 2 million cancers diagnosed in people 15 to 49 years old between 2010 and 2019.",
      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",
      "The findings were published Thursday in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.",
      "The researchers compared cancer rates in 2019 to what would be expected based on 2010 rates.",
      "Breast cancer made up the largest share of the excess cancers, with about 4,800 additional cases. There were 2,000 more colorectal cancers compared with what would be expected based on the 2010 rates. There were 1,800 more kidney cancers and 1,200 additional uterine cancers.",
      "Reassuringly, death rates were not rising for most cancers in the young adult age groups, although increasing death rates were seen for colorectal, uterine and testicular cancers.",
      "Explanations will take more research. The big databases used for the study don't include information on risk factors or access to care. Theories abound and a big meeting is planned later this year to bring together experts in the area.",

      "This isn't happening across the board. Cancer rates in people under 50 are going down for more than a dozen types of cancer, with the largest declines in lung and prostate cancers.",
      "Cigarette smoking has been declining for decades, which likely accounts for the drop in lung cancer among younger adults.",

      "Gates met President Prabowo Subianto at the colonial-style Merdeka palace in Jakarta to discuss global health, nutrition, financial inclusion and public digital infrastructure, Indonesia\u2019s presidential office said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and Gates Foundation praised Indonesia's adoption of vaccines like Rotavirus for diarrhea and Pneumococcus for pneumonia and the country's efforts in reducing child mortality.",
      "He said ten million children under the age of five worldwide died when his foundation launched in 2000, with 90% of the deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia or malaria. That number has now been cut in half to below five million, Gates said.",
      "\u201cIt's been an amazing time period. And there\u2019s many new tools coming,\u201d he told the meeting, which was also attended by prominent Indonesian businesspeople and philanthropists.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says that a prominent medical contrarian and critic of the drug industry will head its vaccine center",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration, has been named to oversee the health agency\u2019s program for vaccines and biotech drugs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the appointment Tuesday in a message to agency staff, praising Prasad's \u201clong and distinguished history in medicine.\u201d",
      "Prasad is the latest in a series of medical contrarians and critics of COVID-19 measures to join the federal government under President Donald Trump.",
      "Unlike political roles such as FDA commissioner, the job Prasad is stepping into has traditionally been held by an FDA career scientist. His appointment raises new questions about whether vaccines and other new therapies will face unnecessary scrutiny from regulators.",
      "Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, FDA\u2019s longtime vaccine chief who resigned in March after clashing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over concerns about the safety of vaccinations.",
      "In a social media post, Prasad likened Marks to \u201ca bobblehead doll that just stamps approval.\"",
      "Last year, he told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy that Americans would probably be better off without the FDA in its current form.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about FDA 2024, I think they\u2019d probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA\u201d Prasad said during an appearance on Ramaswamy's podcast.",
      "A professor at the University of California San Francisco, Prasad's medical training is in cancer and blood disorders. He first came to prominence among academics for a series of papers scrutinizing the evidence behind new cancer therapies.",
      "Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict their long-term benefits.",
      "The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for desperately ill patients.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of vaccine boosters from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.",
      "The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions, prompting pushback from many health experts.",
      "In recent years, Prasad become a regular on podcasts associated with Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, which often portrays the FDA as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Prasad's appointment is likely to alarm drug and vaccine makers, who depend on the predictability of FDA standards and procedures to guide drug development plans that can span years or even decades.",

      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of disgraced and imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden, bringing total legal payouts in civil cases involving the ex-doctor to over $1 billion, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer.",
      "Hadden, now 66, was accused of molesting patients during a decades-long career at prestigious New York City hospitals including Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian. He was convicted by a jury in 2023 of federal sex crime charges and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The new settlements, approved by a Manhattan judge Monday, come in 576 legal cases against the Ivy League school, the hospital and others over the abuse by Hadden, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony T. DiPietro said.",
      "\u201cThis victory is not just for the victims and survivors of Columbia University and The New York-Presbyterian Hospital\u2019s cover-up who bravely came forward, but for all of us who entrust medical institutions with our health care,\u201d DiPietro said in statement.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, Columbia and New York-Presbyterian have prioritized protecting their reputations over protecting their patients,\" he said. \"This settlement sends a powerful message that we\u2019re here to ensure that institutions covering up exploitation and abuse will be held fully accountable for their crimes.\u201d",
      "DiPietro said the average payout to plaintiffs from the new settlement will be about $1.3 million. Columbia previously agreed to $277 million in settlements with more than 200 other plaintiffs over Hadden's sexual abuse, he said.",
      "Columbia confirmed the settlement but not the amount Tuesday. Lawyers for the school and New York-Presbyterian did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "\u201cAs previously announced, Columbia is implementing a multi-pronged plan, including an external investigation, a survivors\u2019 settlement fund, and a series of new and updated patient safety policies and programs to address the abuses of Robert Hadden,\" the university said in statement responding to an Associated Press message specifically asking about the $750 million deal.",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret the pain that his patients suffered, and this settlement is another step forward in our ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors,\u201d it said. \"We commend the survivors for their bravery in coming forward.\u201d",
      "New York-Presbyterian referred questions about the settlement to Columbia, saying the school employed Hadden.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, Laurie Maldonado, who sued Columbia, New York-Presbyterian, Hadden and others, said her case was not about money.",
      "\u201cIt's about accountability,\u201d she said in a statement provided by DiPietro. \"Columbia University enabled sadistic abuse, and now, they\u2019ve been forced to face the truth. We hope this sends a clear message to every institution: survivors will not be silenced, and those who protect abusers will be held responsible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, like Maldonado has.",
      "Hadden\u2019s accusers also included Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate and New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, who said Hadden abused her when she was pregnant with her first child.",
      "During Hadden's criminal trial, nine victims testified about how Hadden molested them during gynecology treatments, starting in the late 1980s, at prominent hospitals.",
      "Allegations of misconduct during examinations first surfaced in 2012. Hadden was indicted on state charges in 2014 as women kept coming forward. But in 2016, the office of the Manhattan district attorney at the time, Cyrus Vance Jr., allowed Hadden to plead guilty to two low-level felonies and a misdemeanor in a deal that required him to give up his medical license but did not require jail time and kept him out of the state\u2019s sex offender registry.",
      "Some of the women who had gone to state prosecutors were outraged, but their stories did not start receiving public attention until the #MeToo movement began gaining steam in 2017.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan got a grand jury indictment against Hadden in 2020, charges based on the fact that some patients at his New York offices had come into the city from other states.",
      "In November 2023, Columbia and Columbia University Irving Medical Center announced they would be notifying 6,500 former patients of Hadden of his federal sex crime convictions and giving victims the opportunity to apply for compensation from a $100 million settlement fund. The deadline to apply has been extended to May 15.",

    "story": [
      "Utah dentists say they\u2019re bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state\u2019s most vulnerable people",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- With Utah's first-in-the-nation ban on fluoride in public drinking water set to take effect Wednesday, dentists who treat children and low-income patients say they're bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state's most vulnerable people.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed the law against the recommendation of many dentists and national health experts who warn removing fluoride will harm tooth development, especially in young patients without regular access to dental care.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, said she does not dispute that fluoride can have some benefits but thinks people should not be given it by the government without their informed consent.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. applauded Utah for being the first state to enact a ban and said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide.",
      "Florida could soon become the second state to ban fluoride under a bill awaiting Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature. The Ohio and South Carolina legislatures are considering similar measures.",
      "A majority of Utah water systems already did not add fluoride. The state ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents receiving fluoridated water, with about 2 in 5 receiving it in 2022, according to CDC data. The law will impact about 1.6 million people in Salt Lake City and elsewhere in northern Utah who are losing fluoridation, state officials say.",
      "Dentists in Salt Lake City over the past week said many patients were unaware of the upcoming ban, and most did not realize the city had been adding fluoride to their drinking water for nearly two decades.",
      "\u201cI did not know about a ban,\u201d said Noe Figueroa, a patient at Salt Lake Donated Dental Services, a clinic that provides free or heavily discounted dental treatment to low-income residents. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good at all.\u201d",
      "At Donated Dental, providers expect their monthslong waitlist for children's procedures to grow significantly and their need for volunteer dentists to skyrocket. The effects of the ban in children\u2019s teeth will likely be visible within the next year, said Sasha Harvey, the clinic\u2019s executive director.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re scheduling into August and September for some 2-, 3-, 4-year-olds that are in so much pain that they can\u2019t eat properly, and there\u2019s nothing we can do but tell parents, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to wait.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Harvey said, adding that it's likely to get much worse.",
      "The fluoridation process involves supplementing the low levels of naturally occurring fluoride in most water to reach the 0.7 milligrams per liter recommended by the CDC for cavity prevention. Water treatment plants dump fluoride into the water in liquid or powder form and often use dosing pumps to adjust the levels.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population receives fluoridated drinking water, according to health officials. It was long considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride fortifies teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. It\u2019s especially important to children whose teeth are still developing. For some low-income families, public drinking water containing fluoride may be their only source of preventative dental care.",
      "Some supporters of the Utah law pointed to studies linking high levels of fluoride exposure to illness and low IQ in kids. The National Institutes of Health says it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose from fluoride added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.",
      "The governor said that, like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his children in a community without fluoridated water. Before signing the bill, Cox said there is no difference in health outcomes between communities with and without fluoride \u2014 a statement Utah dentists say is false.",
      "\u201cAny dentist can look in someone\u2019s mouth in Utah and tell exactly where they grew up. Did you grow up in a fluoridated area or a non-fluoridated area? We can tell by the level of decay,\u201d said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
      "The law shifts responsibility to individuals, meaning all Utah residents will need to be proactive about their oral health, Harvey said. Most patients at her clinic only come in when a toothache becomes unbearable, and many cannot spare the few dollars a month needed to buy fluoride supplements to add to their drinking water at home.",
      "Figueroa, the free dental clinic patient, said other expenses take priority.",
      "Fluoride toothpaste alone is insufficient for children because it doesn't penetrate the tooth's outer layer, Bekker said. When a person regularly ingests fluoridated water, their saliva bathes the teeth in fluoride throughout the day and makes them stronger.",
      "Bekker said he recommends Utah parents add fluoride supplements to their children\u2019s drinking water. But for families who don\u2019t visit doctors regularly, that may prove difficult.",
      "Fluoride tablets require a prescription from a doctor or dentist. Utah providers are working to make the supplement accessible over the counter, but Bekker said that change may be months or years away.",

      "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is running for governor in 2026 and sharing new anecdotes in her upcoming political memoir, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d including her experience with miscarriage",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Ahead of a nationally watched bid to become Michigan\u2019s next governor, Democrat Jocelyn Benson is releasing a memoir this month that includes her first public discussion of a miscarriage she had about eight years ago \u2014 an experience she says will shape her commitment to increasing access to reproductive healthcare in the swing state.",
      "Benson, Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, is part of a crowded field seeking to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and she\u2019s the only woman in the running so far.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Tuesday's release of her political memoir entitled, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d Benson said miscarrying made her value easy access to reproductive health care in an emotional and difficult situation, something she wants to deliver for the state if elected.",
      "\u201cIt opened my eyes to the need to not just protect reproductive freedom and rights, but actually make sure they\u2019re real,\u201d said Benson.",
      "In a chapter entitled \u201cGrit and Grace,\u201d Benson describes finding out she was pregnant shortly after her son\u2019s first birthday and shortly before she launched her bid for secretary of state in 2017. Waves of worry over the timing and elation over becoming a mother of two ensued. But just a day later, she began to miscarry.",
      "She writes about the doctor\u2019s appointment during her eighth week of pregnancy where she learned about her options: surgery, medication or stillbirth and what to expect as her miscarriage continued. By the following morning, she had miscarried on her own.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact of that stays with you for your whole life,\u201d she told AP.",
      "Benson said she struggled with shame and guilt, emotions she has learned many women experience.",
      "\u201cI want to tell my story to say it\u2019s OK to tell yours as well,\u201d she said.",
      "In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, women seeking public office have shared personal stories of miscarriages and abortions. Democrats and Republicans alike have spoken about their pregnancies as reproductive and maternal health care became a central concern for Americans.",
      "In Michigan, voters approved a ballot measure in 2022 to protect abortion access, in an election that also saw Democrats sweep statewide and legislative elections. But Benson said that protection isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Step one is to incentivize talented physicians to work in Michigan, she said. Step two is to bolster reproductive health care in rural Michigan, she said, suggesting mobile clinics that can reach remote areas.",
      "She noted the recent closure of three Planned Parenthood locations in Michigan, including its only location in the Upper Peninsula. Some Planned Parenthood locations provide abortions in addition to services such as birth control, disease screenings and miscarriage management.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Michigan leaders cited financial challenges exacerbated by a freeze of federal dollars for the closures. Federal law already prohibited taxpayer dollars from paying for most abortions.",
      "Centering reproductive rights in the 2026 primary will be another test of the issue\u2019s importance to Democratic voters. Benson will face Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the gubernatorial primary. Whitmer, who is term limited, has said she does not plan to endorse in the race.",
      "On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aaric Nesbitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are vying for the nomination and likely also the endorsement of President Donald Trump.",
      "And the twist \u2014 Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is pursuing the office as an independent. The move comes as Democrats lost considerable ground in the 2024 election. The state swung back to Trump in the 2024 election and Republicans gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, splitting control of the legislature.",
      "Among anecdotes from her memoir that include her tenure as the state's chief election official during the 2020 election and her law career before, Benson took a swing at Duggan over his handling of the 2018 primary election for governor. She criticized him for not supporting Whitmer early in the race and encouraging other Democrats, who are men, to pursue a run, citing reporting in the New Yorker years later.",
      "\u201cI will never forget the message those efforts sent to women across our state,\u201d Benson wrote. She noted that her own primary campaign became tied to Whitmer\u2019s by gender.",
      "\u201cThe argument went something like, surely we can\u2019t have more than one woman on the ticket at the same time,\u201d Benson wrote.",
      "Benson\u2019s memoir comments on Duggan were first reported by the Detroit News. A spokesperson for Duggan\u2019s campaign told the publication that the Detroit mayor endorsed Whitmer in the Democratic primary over two men.",

      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging cuts to the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, saying the Trump administration's massive restructuring has destroyed life-saving programs and left states to pick up the bill for mounting health crises.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rhode Island on Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said. The attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia signed onto the complaint.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured the agency in March, eliminating more than 10,000 employees and collapsing 28 agencies under the sprawling HHS umbrella into 15, the attorneys general said. An additional 10,000 employees had already been let go by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the lawsuit, and combined the cuts stripped 25% of the HHS workforce.",
      "\u201cIn its first three months, Secretary Kennedy and this administration deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job,\u201d the attorneys general wrote.",
      "Kennedy has said he is seeking to streamline the nation's public health agencies and reduce redundancies across them with the layoffs. The cuts were made as part of a directive the administration has dubbed, \u201c Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is not government reform. This is not efficiency,\u201d James said during a press conference Monday.",
      "The cuts have resulted in laboratories having limited testing for some infectious diseases, the federal government not tracking cancer risks among U.S. firefighters, early childhood learning programs left unsure of future funds and programs aimed at monitoring cancer and maternal health closing, the attorneys general say. Cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have hampered states' ability to respond to one of the largest measles outbreaks in recent years, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis chaos and abandonment of the Department\u2019s core functions was not an unintended side effect, but rather the intended result,\u201d of the \u201cMAHA Directive,\u201d they said. They want a judge to vacate the directive because they say the administration can't unilaterally eliminate programs and funding that have been created by Congress.",
      "The restructuring eliminated the entire team of people who maintain the federal poverty guidelines used by states to determine whether residents are eligible for Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other programs. A tobacco prevention agency was gutted. Staff losses also were significant at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "The Trump administration is already facing other legal challenges over cuts to public health agencies and research organizations.

      "Yet some health experts say the eliminated programs are not duplicative, and erasing them will leave Americans in the dark.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is interested in making itself healthier again, how is it going to know, if it cancels the programs that helps us understand these diseases?\u201d said Graham Mooney, a Johns Hopkins University public health historian.",
      "The core of the nation\u2019s health surveillance is done by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Relying on birth and death certificates, it generates information on birth rates, death trends and life expectancy. It also operates longstanding health surveys that provide basic data on obesity, asthma and other health issues.",
      "The center has been barely touched in layoffs, and seems intact under current budget plans.",
      "But many other efforts were targeted by the cuts, the AP found. Some examples:",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff \u2014 about 20 people.",
      "It\u2019s the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.",
      "Recent layoffs also wiped out the staffs collecting data on in vitro fertilizations and abortions.",
      "Those cuts are especially surprising given that President Donald Trump said he wants to expand IVF access and that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook for his administration called for more abortion surveillance.",
      "The CDC eliminated its program on lead poisoning in children, which helped local health departments \u2014 through funding and expertise \u2014 investigate lead poisoning clusters and find where risk is greatest.",
      "Lead poisoning in kids typically stems from exposure to bits of old paint, contaminated dust or drinking water that passes through lead pipes. But the program's staff also played an important role in the investigation of lead-tainted applesauce that affected 500 kids.",
      "Last year, Milwaukee health officials became aware that peeling paint in aging local elementary schools was endangering kids. The city health department began working with CDC to test tens of thousands of students. That assistance stopped last month when the CDC\u2019s lead program staff was terminated.",
      "City officials are particularly concerned about losing expertise to help them track the long-term effects.",
      "\"We don't know what we don't know,\" said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Also gone is the staff for the 23-year-old Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which had information on concerns including possible cancer clusters and weather-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe loss of that program is going to greatly diminish the ability to make linkages between what might be in the environment and what health might be affected by that,\u201d Breysse said.",
      "In some cases, it\u2019s not a matter of staffers leaving, but rather the end of specific types of data collection.",
      "Transgender status is no longer being recorded in health-tracking systems, including ones focused on violent deaths and on risky behaviors by kids.",
      "Experts know transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence, but now \u201cit\u2019s going to be much more challenging to quantify the extent to which they are at higher risk,\u201d said Thomas Simon, the recently retired senior director for scientific programs at the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention.",
      "The staff and funding seems to have remained intact for a CDC data collection that provides insights into homicides, suicides and accidental deaths involving weapons.",
      "But CDC violence-prevention programs that acted on that information were halted. So, too, was work on a system that collects hospital data on nonfatal injuries from causes such as shootings, crashes and drownings.",
      "Also going away, apparently, is the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The system is designed to pick up information that's not found in law enforcement statistics. Health officials see that work as important, because not all sexual violence victims go to police.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which tracks job-related illnesses and deaths and makes recommendations on how to prevent them, was gutted by the cuts.",
      "Kennedy has said that 20% of the people laid off might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes.",
      "That appeared to happen last month, when the American Federation of Government Employees said that NIOSH workers involved in a black lung disease program for coal miners had been temporarily called back.",
      "But HHS officials did not answer questions about the reinstatement. The AFGE's Micah Niemeier-Walsh later said the workers continued to have June termination dates and \u201cwe are concerned this is to give the appearance that the programs are still functioning, when effectively they are not.\u201d",
      "There's been no talk of salvaging some other NIOSH programs, including one focused on workplace deaths in the oil and gas industries or a research project into how common hearing loss is in that industry.",
      "The HHS cuts eliminated the 17-member team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one of the main ways the government measures drug use.",
      "Also axed were the CDC staff working on the National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "There are other surveys that look at youth smoking and drug use, including the University of Michigan's federally funded \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d survey of schoolkids.",
      "But the federal studies looked at both adults and adolescents, and provided insights into drug use by high school dropouts. The CDC also delved into specific vaping and tobacco products in the ways that other surveys don't, and was a driver in the federal push to better regulate electronic cigarettes.",
      "\"There was overlap among the surveys, but each one had its own specific focus that the other ones didn\u2019t cover,\u201c said Richard Miech, who leads the Michigan study.",
      "Work to modernize data collection has been derailed. That includes an upgrade to a 22-year-old system that helps local public health departments track diseases and allows CDC to put together a national picture.",
      "Another casualty was the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which tries to predict disease trends.",
      "The center, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, was working on forecasting the current multi-state measles outbreak. That forecast hasn't been published partly because of the layoffs, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss it and fear retribution for speaking to the press.",
      "Trump hasn't always supported widespread testing of health problems.",
      "In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 diagnoses were exploding, the president groused that the nation\u2019s ability to do more testing was making the U.S. look like it had a worse problem than other countries. He called testing \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d",
      "Mooney, the Johns Hopkins historian, wonders how interested the new administration is in reporting on health problems.",
      "\u201cYou could think it\u2019s deliberate,\" he said. \u201cIf you keep people from knowing, they\u2019re less likely to be concerned.\u201d",

      "It was an unusual study about trust, vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "WASHINGTON -- Some Denver parents got texts during this winter\u2019s brutal flu season with videos sharing why people in their neighborhoods chose flu shots for their kids, an unusual study about trust and vaccines in a historically Black community.",
      "But no one will know how it worked out: The Trump administration canceled the project before the data could be analyzed -- and researchers aren\u2019t the only ones upset.",
      "\u201cFor someone like me, from the Black community who income-wise is on the lower end, we don\u2019t often have a voice,\u201d said Denver mom Chantyl Busby, one of the study\u2019s community advisers. \u201cHaving this funding taken away from this project sends a horrible, horrible message. It\u2019s almost like telling us all over again that our opinions don\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "How to talk about vaccines with parents \u2013 or anyone \u2013 is taking on new urgency: At least 216 U.S. children died of flu this season, the worst pediatric toll in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unvaccinated children are fueling one of the country's largest measles outbreaks in decades, and another vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 whooping cough \u2014 is soaring, too.",
      "At the same time Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. questions vaccines long proven to be safe and effective. Moves by the Trump administration are making it increasingly uncertain that COVID-19 vaccines will be available this fall. And the administration has slashed funding for public health and medical research, including abruptly stopping studies of vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand what it is that is creating this challenge to vaccines and why,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy and worries the country is entering \u201cscientific dark ages.\"",
      "At Denver Health, Dr. Joshua Williams is a pediatrician who every day has vaccine conversations with confused or worried parents. Some even ask if they\u2019ll get kicked out of his practice for refusing immunizations.",
      "Nope, Williams says: Building trust takes time.",
      "\u201cThe most satisfying vaccine-related encounters I have are the ones in families who had significant concerns for a long time, came to trust me over the years as I cared for broken arms and ear infections \u2013 and ultimately vaccinated their child,\u201d he said.",
      "But in the TikTok age, Williams wondered if digital storytelling \u2013 seeing and hearing what led other families to choose vaccination \u2013 might help those decisions. He chose flu shots as the test case \u2014 just under half of U.S. children got one this season. And Black children are among those most at risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.",
      "With a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Williams partnered with Denver\u2019s nonprofit Center for African American Health to host workshops bringing volunteers together to discuss how influenza and the flu vaccine had impacted their lives. Professionals helped those who wanted to go the extra step turn them into 2- to 3-minute polished videos.",
      "After two years of community engagement, five of those videos were part of the pilot study sending text messages to 200 families who get care at two Denver Health clinics.",
      "In one video, a mother described getting her first flu vaccination along with her young daughter, making her own health decisions after leaving a controlling relationship.",
      "In another, a grandmother explained how she\u2019ll never again miss a vaccine appointment after her grandson spent his 4th birthday hospitalized with the flu.",
      "Seeing \u201cpeople that they look like, that they sound like, who have experiences they\u2019ve been through that can go, \u2018Hey, I felt like you felt but this changed my life,\u2019\u201d is powerful, said Busby, who OK'd her kids' flu vaccinations after questioning Williams during multiple family checkups.",
      "The study's sudden cancellation means Williams can\u2019t assess if the texted videos influenced families' vaccine decisions \u2013 lost data from more than two years of work and already-spent NIH dollars. It also jeopardizes the researchers' careers. While considering next steps, Williams has asked permission of community members to use some of the videos in his own practice as he discusses vaccination.",
      "Williams gets personal, too, telling families that his kids are vaccinated and how his 95-year-old grandmother reminisces about the terror of polio during her own childhood before those vaccinations were developed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost the collective memory about what it\u2019s like to have these diseases in our community,\u201d Williams said, ruefully noting the ongoing measles outbreak. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take a collective voice from the community saying this is important, to remind those in power that we need to be allocating resources to infection prevention and vaccine hesitancy research.\u201d",

      "A swimming coach in Nigeria's economic hub of Lagos is teaching disabled children how to swim through his nonprofit aimed at empowering them in life",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- About 20 children in shorts and vests gather at a swimming pool on a sweltering afternoon in Nigeria's economic hub of Lagos. A coach holds the hand of a boy who is blind as he demonstrates swimming motions and guides him through the pool while others take note.",
      "It was one of the sessions with students of the Pacelli School for the Blind and Partially Sighted, where Emeka Chuks Nnadi, the swimming coach, uses his Swim in 1 Day, or SID, nonprofit to teach swimming to disabled children.",
      "In a country where hundreds drown every year, often because of boat mishaps but sometimes as a result of domestic accidents, the initiative has so far taught at least 400 disabled people how to swim. It has also aided their personal development.",
      "\u201cIt (has) helped me a lot, especially in class,\u201d said 14-year-old Fikayo Adodo, one of Nnadi's trainees who is blind. \u201cI am very confident now to speak with a crowd, with people. My brain is sharper, like very great.\"",
      "The World Health Organization considers drowning as one of the leading causes of death through unintentional injury globally, with at least 300,000 people dying from drowning every year. The most at risk are young children.",
      "Many of the deaths occur in African countries like Nigeria, with limited resources and training to avert such deaths.",
      "In Nigeria \u2014 a country of more than 200 million people, 35 million of whom the government says are disabled \u2014 the challenge is far worse for disabled people who have less access to limited opportunities and resources in addition to societal stigma.",
      "While the initiative is raising awareness among the children about drowning, it benefits wider society in different ways, Nnadi said, especially \u201cif you want to have disabled people that are contributing to the economy and not just dependent on us as a society to take care of them.\u201d",
      "Nnadi recalled setting up the nonprofit after moving back to Nigeria from Spain in 2022 and seeing how disabled people are treated compared to others. It was a wide gap, he said, and thought that teaching them how to swim at a young age would be a great way to improve their lives.",
      "\u201cThere is a thing in Africa where parents are ashamed of their (disabled) kids,\u201d he said. \u201cSo (I am) trying to make people understand that your child that is blind could actually become a swimming superstar or a lawyer or doctor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI find it rewarding (watching) them transform right under my eyes,\u201d Nnadi said of the results of such lessons.",
      "Watching them take their lessons, some struggle to stay calm in the water and stroke their way through it, but Nnadi and the two volunteers working with him patiently guide them through the water, often leaving them excited to quickly try again.",
      "Some of them said that it gives them pleasure, while it is a lifesaving skill for some and it's therapy for others. Experts have also said that swimming can improve mental well-being, in addition to the physical benefits from exercising.",
      "\u201cSwimming (has) taught me to face my fears, it has (given) me boldness, it has given me courage, it has made me overcome my fears,\u201d said 13-year-old Ikenna Goodluck, who is blind and among Nnadi\u2019s trainees.",
      "Ejiro Justina Obinwanne said that the initiative has helped her son Chinedu become more determined in life.",
      "\u201cHe is selfless and determined to make something out of the lives of children that the world has written off in a lot of ways,\u201d she said of Nnadi.",

      "GENEVA -- Switzerland's president lamented \u201cdisappointing\u201d talks Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump's treasury secretary that did not ease stiff U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods, but expressed hope for a solution to a more consequential U.S.-China face-off on tariffs in Geneva this weekend.",
      "Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, who also serves as finance minister, said she was nonetheless encouraged by the talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as Switzerland tries to wriggle out of hefty 31% U.S. tariffs of Swiss goods as part of Trump's sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on countries around the globe.",
      "Their meeting was only an appetizer for the potentially market-moving talks Saturday and Sunday between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva. Keller-Sutter also met with the Chinese envoy, but said it was merely a courtesy.",
      "As for the U.S.-China talks, the Swiss leader alluded to the election of the first U.S.-born pontiff, Pope Leo XIV, and quipped: \"I said to Secretary Bessent that apparently the Holy Spirit was in Rome yesterday, and I hope that he will come to Geneva over the weekend.\u201d",
      "The talks have been shrouded in secrecy and the Chinese and U.S. sides have declined to specify where they will take place other than somewhere in Geneva, which hosted U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2021 \u2014 before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "While the U.S. administration has temporarily suspended the most severe tariffs against every target country except China, the 31% rate \u2014 if restored \u2014 would put Switzerland in a worse position than its neighbors in the European Union, which are to face 20% U.S. tariffs on EU goods.",
      "The Swiss government said its talks Friday with Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were \u201cconvivial and constructive\u201d and were aimed to lay out the guidelines for a deal on the issue of customs duties to be discussed again in coming weeks.",
      "On April 9 \u2014 a week after Trump announced the U.S. \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 he spoke with Keller-Sutter by phone and later announced a pause in their implementation for 90 days and capped the additional U.S. tariffs at 10% for most countries, with the notable exception of China.",
      "\u201cOf course, it is disappointing,\" Keller-Sutter said when asked about the lack of a deal in talks with Bessent, before alluding to her earlier phone conversation with Trump. \u201cI also told President Trump that this was not fair. But on the other hand, you know, I mean, we\u2019re not looking back, we are looking forward.\u201d",
      "\"And we\u2019re really encouraged by the talks we had that we\u2019re going to find a solution, and the U.S. side really engaged with Switzerland also to find a swift solution,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "Keller-Sutter trumpeted Swiss investment in the United States, saying it has created 400,000 jobs and \u201caverage salary $130,000, which is a lot\u201d in the United States. She said she didn't know whether her call with Trump on April 9 convinced him to ease back on the tariffs, before adding with a laugh: \u201cHe should listen to women.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend talks between Bessent and He, the U.S. slapped 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, and Beijing has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Earlier Friday, Trump floated the prospect that those could be lowered sharply in a social media post.",

      "El Salvador has been living under a state of emergency for more than three years, which has suspended some fundamental rights and given the administration of President Nayib Bukele extraordinary powers. More than 85,000 Salvadorans have been arrested over the period for alleged ties to the country\u2019s once-powerful street gangs.",
      "The improvement in El Salvador\u2019s security has won Bukele widespread domestic support and some admirers in the region who seek to imitate his success. But the lack of due process and numerous arbitrary arrests have drawn international condemnation. Bukele has dismissed those critics as defenders of criminals.",
      "A spokesperson for Bukele's office declined to comment Friday.",
      "With the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump taking a hard line on immigration and portraying migrants broadly as criminals, neither government has been swayed by legal maneuvers in their own country to seek the men\u2019s release or return to the U.S.",
      "A judge in Washington this week said he would order the U.S. government to provide more information about its prison deal with El Salvador as he moved closer to requiring the government to return the men to the U.S.",
      "The human rights organizations hope that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights will accept this emergency petition. The commission is an arm of the regional Organization of American States. The groups presented the case on behalf of the families of 18 of the men sent to El Salvador, who provided sworn statements about their cases.",
      "Some of the men had pending asylum applications in the U.S., while others had been vetted and approved for refugee resettlement by the U.S. government, still others had temporary protected status allowing them to work in the U.S., according to the lawsuit.",
      "Bukele has said he has the room to hold the men and the payments from the U.S. will help cover the costs of his new prison.",

      "The groups are asking the human right commission to order precautionary measures, basically an emergency action to prevent irreparable harm. Among them are the ability to communicate with their families, access to legal counsel and return to the United States. The commission would seek a response from El Salvador\u2019s government before making a decision, but is expected to move quickly.",

    "story": [
      "Two men have been convicted of cutting down the beloved Sycamore Gap tree in northern England along ancient Hadrian\u2019s Wall",
      "LONDON -- In late September 2023, as the first big storm of the fall was kicking up in the U.K., a malicious plan was hatched to take down one of England\u2019s favorite trees.",
      "Daniel Graham sent a message to his buddy, Adam Carruthers, telling him to \u201cget the saws warmed up,\u201d suggesting they might get some work clearing fallen trees.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t high winds that brought down the famous Sycamore Gap tree that night, jurors determined Friday. It was Graham and Carruthers \u2014 not cleaning up damage from the storm, but creating a mess of their own.",
      "The pair were convicted of two counts each of criminal damage by a jury in Newcastle Crown Court after little more than five hours of deliberations over two days.",
      "Even without the smoking chainsaw, prosecutors were able to prove the case through a trove of digital evidence that either put the men near the tree at the time it was felled or showed them excitedly discussing it the next day as the story of the tree\u2019s demise went viral.",
      "The prime piece of evidence was a grainy video on Graham\u2019s phone of the crime being committed on the dark and stormy night.",
      "Footage of the tree's last stand showed a solitary figure silhouetted beneath the towering canopy in a struggle with the trunk as the unmistakable sound of the chainsaw whined above the wind. With a single crack, the buzz of the saw died down, the person stepped back and the tree that had stood about 150 years crashed to earth.",
      "Metadata pinpointed the location of the video at the tree\u2019s location in Northumberland National Park. Other data showed Graham\u2019s Range Rover had traveled there.",
      "The Sycamore Gap tree was not Britain\u2019s biggest or oldest sycamore, but it was prized for its picturesque setting, symmetrically planted between two hills along the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire, and had attracted generations of followers.",
      "The tree had long been known to locals but received international attention in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.\u201d It drew tourists, lovers, landscape photographers and even those who spread the ashes of loved ones.",
      "\u201cFor over a century, Sycamore Gap has been an iconic natural landmark in the northeast of England, bringing immeasurable joy to those visiting the area,\" Gale Gilchrist, chief prosecutor for the region, said in a statement after the verdict. \u201cIn just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction.\u201d",
      "Neither Graham, who had a small construction business, nor Carruthers, a mechanic who sometimes worked with him, showed any visible reaction as the verdicts were read.",
      "Justice Christina Lambert ordered both men held in custody until sentencing on July 15 and said they could face \u201ca lengthy period in custody.\u201d The maximum sentence for criminal damage is 10 years in prison.",
      "The defendants, once close friends, both testified that they were at their respective homes that night and had nothing to do with the crime.",
      "Graham pointed the finger at Carruthers, saying he was obsessed with the tree. Graham said his friend and another man had taken his Range Rover and phone to the site to frame him.",
      "Carruthers said he didn't understand why people were so upset about \u201cjust a tree,\u201d saying it was \u201calmost as if someone had been murdered.\u201d His lawyer suggested Graham told a desperate lie after being caught.",
      "Prosecutor Richard Wright said the two men were in on it together from the start, with evidence showing Carruthers had gone far out of his way earlier in the day to go near the tree on a reconnaissance mission.",
      "Wright said he couldn\u2019t say who cut the tree and who held the phone, but the two men were the only people in the world with the video on their devices.",
      "As Graham\u2019s vehicle was tracked on its way back toward his home in Carlisle \u2014 about 40 minutes away \u2014 Carruthers received a video from his partner of their infant and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got a better video than that,\u201d Wright said.",
      "\u201cAt the time of that text conversation, the only people in the world who knew the tree had been felled were the men who had had cut it down,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd the only people in the world who had access to the video were the men who had filmed themselves in the act of cutting down the tree: the defendants Graham and Carruthers.\u201d",
      "The next day, the two feverishly exchanged messages after the tree was discovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gone viral. It is worldwide,\u201d Graham said.",
      "Carruthers forwarded a Facebook comment by a man who criticized the \u201cdisgusting behavior\u201d of the \u201cweak\u201d vandals.",
      "Carruthers said he\u2019d like to see the man \u201claunch an operation like we did last night.\u201d",
      "Wright said police never located the chainsaw used to fell the tree, but each man had access to plenty of saws \u2014 a fact they both tried to downplay. Investigators also couldn't find a wedge of wood cut from the trunk to drop the tree in the right direction.",
      "But images on Graham\u2019s phone showed a slice of wood and a chainsaw in the back of his vehicle at his home. A forensic botanist said there was \u201cvery strong evidence\u201d it was the missing wedge that Wright suggested had been taken as a trophy.",
      "Prosecutors offered no evidence of a motive for the crime other than calling it senseless vandalism. But Wright suggested to jurors in his closing argument that the men cut the tree down for \u201ca bit of a laugh\u201d but had failed to realize the anger they would spark in the \u201carboreal equivalent of mindless thuggery.\u201d",
      "The tree was originally valued at more than 620,000 pounds (around $830,000) and damage to the wall was estimated at 1,100 pounds (nearly $1,500).",
      "But on Friday prosecutor Rebecca Brown said those figures are in dispute and are likely lower, but would still easily fit in the top category of harm for sentencing purposes.",

It was the first time in Ukraine's history that a Hungarian espionage operation had been discovered, the statement said.",
      "The activities of the suspected spies were focused on the western Ukraine region of Zakarpattia, which borders Hungary and is home to a sizeable Hungarian ethnic minority. Budapest and Kyiv have clashed over the rights of Hungarians in Zakarpattia, most of which was part of Hungary until the end of World War I.",
      "Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 did not directly deny the allegations of a Hungarian espionage cell operating in Ukraine, but suggested that the SBU\u2019s claims could be classified as \u201canti-Hungarian propaganda.\u201d",

      "Hungary, a member of NATO and the European Union, has taken an adversarial approach to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, refusing to supply Kyiv with weaponry or to allow its transfer across Hungarian territory.",
      "The Hungarian government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has also threatened to bloc EU financial assistance to Ukraine, argued against sanctions on Russia and opposed Ukraine's eventual membership in the EU.",
      "Orb\u00e1n is widely seen as having the warmest relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin among EU leaders, though he has acknowledged that the war was a result of Russian aggression.",
      "The SBU said both suspected spies were overseen by a career officer of Hungary\u2019s military intelligence, whose identity had also been established. That officer supplied the network with cash and a special device for covert communication to support the operation, and had attempted to recruit other individuals into the network, the SBU said.",

Their attendance underscored how Putin has tried to emphasize the failure of the West to turn Russia into a global pariah.",

      "For Putin, Victory Day celebrations have become \"a civic religion that boosts patriotism, nationalism, nostalgia, and justifies both his repressive regime at home and Russia\u2019s increasingly expansionist foreign policy abroad, particularly including towards its neighbors,\u201d Gabuev said.",
      "The parade featured over 11,500 troops and more than 180 military vehicles, including tanks, armored infantry vehicles and artillery used on the battlefield in Ukraine. As a reminder of Russia's nuclear might, huge Yars nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles launchers rolled across Red Square.",
      "Fighter jets of Russian air force's aerobatic teams flew by in close formation, followed by jets that trailed smoke in the colors of the national flag.",
      "Afterward, Putin shook hands with Russian generals who led the troops onto Red Square and spoke to medal-bedecked senior North Korean officers who watched the parade, hugging one of them.",
      "Last month, Putin thanked North Korea for fighting alongside Russian troops against Ukrainian forces and hailed their sacrifices as Pyongyang confirmed its deployment for the first time.",
      "The Russian and North Korean statements emphasized their expanding military partnership, especially after Russia said its troops have fully reclaimed the Kursk region that Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last year. Ukraine denied the claim.",
      "Victory Day festivities this year were overshadowed by Ukrainian drone attacks targeting Moscow and severe disruptions at the capital\u2019s airports. Aeroflot on Wednesday canceled more than 100 flights to and from Moscow, and delayed over 140 others as the military repelled Ukrainian drone attacks on the capital.",
      "Russian authorities tightened security ahead of the parade and cellphone internet outages were reported amid electronic countermeasures aimed at foiling more potential drone attacks.",
      "Putin had declared a unilateral 72-hour ceasefire starting May 7 to coincide with the Victory Day celebrations, but warned that Russian troops would retaliate to any attacks. Moscow has been reluctant to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day truce that Ukraine has accepted, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies to Ukraine and Kyiv\u2019s mobilization effort, conditions Ukraine and its Western allies have rejected.",
      "Ukrainian authorities reported scores of Russian strikes Friday that killed at least two people in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and damaged buildings. A Russian drone also struck a civilian vehicle in Zaporizhzhia, critically injuring a man and also wounding his wife.",
      "As the parade and other festivities unfolded in Moscow, dozens of European officials met in Lviv, in western Ukraine, to endorse the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian officials accused of war crimes.",
      "\u201cRussia needs to feel our common and, most importantly, growing strength,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, addressing the Lviv meeting. He emphasized the need for Russia to be held accountable, adding that \u201cthis is the moral duty of Europe and of everyone in the world who values human life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure that this tribunal will allow for the fight against impunity against all war crimes that have been committed during this war of aggression of Russia against Ukraine,\u201d said French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot.",
      "Russian authorities have fiercely denied allegations of war crimes.",
      "Barrot also said European allies have agreed on another package of sanctions against Russia.",
      "Standing alongside top Ukrainian government officials in Lviv, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the tribunal's launch will mean that \u201cnobody can be left unpunished for the crimes committed.\"",

      "BANGKOK -- Thailand\u2019s King Maha Vajiralongkorn presided Friday over an elaborate annual ceremony that marks the start of the rice-planting season and honors the nation's farmers.",
      "The Royal Ploughing Ceremony is held to read auguries that predict the farming conditions for the year ahead. As is usually the case, good times were predicted, even though Thailand's economy is sluggish.",
      "The King and Queen Suthida were sheltered from the bright sun by ornate umbrellas at the ceremony\u2019s traditional venue, Sanam Luang, or \u201cRoyal Ground,\u201d a large field near the Grand Palace in the capital Bangkok.",
      "According to Thai historians, the ritual goes back some 700 years. Then, as now, the cultivation of rice was central to the country\u2019s culture and economy, and the ceremony is meant to give encouragement to farmers as the new planting season begins.",
      "The ceremony was led by the highest-ranking civil servant in the Agriculture Ministry, serving as the Lord of the Ploughing Ceremony. In a colorful traditional costume, he chose from a selection of cloths, and the one he picked was interpreted to signify satisfactory rainfall and an abundant harvest.",
      "In the ceremony\u2019s second stage, he anointed the heads of two \u201csacred\u201d oxen, who then pulled a plough around a section of the field several times, as he scattered seeds at the front of a small procession with more traditionally garbed participants.",
      "The two oxen, called \u201cPor\u201d and \u201cPiang\u201d \u2014 which together mean \u201csufficiency\u201d \u2014 then chose from a selection of food offered by Brahmin priests. The foods chosen were water, grass and liquor, which symbolize adequate water supplies, abundance of food supplies and what was interpreted as good international trade, respectively.",
      "After the departure of the king and queen, onlookers sprinted onto the field to collect the scattered seeds as souvenirs or to add to their own rice stores at home for a meritorious mix.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "The massive power outage that hit the Iberian peninsula last month has reignited a debate in Spain over the country\u2019s plan to phase out its nuclear reactors and generate more power with renewable energy",
      "MADRID -- The massive power outage that hit the Iberian peninsula on April 28 has reignited a debate in Spain over the country's plan to phase out its nuclear reactors as it generates more power with renewable energy.",
      "As people wait for answers about what caused the historic power cut, which abruptly disrupted tens of millions of lives, some are questioning the wisdom of decommissioning nuclear reactors that provide a stable, if controversial, form of energy compared to renewables, whose output can be intermittent.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has rejected such criticism, asking for patience while the government investigates what caused the grid's disconnection. He said that his government would not \u201cdeviate a single millimeter\u201d from its energy transition plans.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the energy debate:",
      "Nuclear power is a zero-carbon energy source formed from nuclear fission, when the nuclei of atoms are split into two or several parts, releasing energy.",
      "It accounts for about 10% of electricity generation worldwide, according to the International Energy Association.",
      "Many countries consider nuclear power critical to reaching their net-zero goals. But while nuclear reactors do not emit planet-warming greenhouse gases like gas- or coal-fired power plants, they produce radioactive waste that even advanced economies have struggled to dispose.",
      "Spain generated nearly 57% of its electricity in 2024 from renewable energy sources like wind, hydropower and solar, according to Red El\u00e9ctrica, the country\u2019s grid operator. About 20% came from nuclear power plants.",
      "In 2019, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s government approved a plan to decommission the country\u2019s remaining nuclear reactors between 2027 and 2035 as it expands its share of renewable energy even further. The country aims to generate 81% of its electricity by 2030 from renewable sources.",
      "S\u00e1nchez on Wednesday said that the four nuclear facilities that were online the day of the blackout did not help re-power the grid.",
      "Batteries and other methods help regulate changes in electricity supply from wind and solar.",
      "While the cause of the sudden outage on April 28 is still unknown, the event has raised questions about the technical challenges facing electricity grids running on high levels of solar and wind.",
      "Solar and wind provided roughly 70% of the electricity on the grid moments before Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity \u2014 about 60% of its supply \u2014 in just five seconds.",
      "Electricity grids were designed for a different era, according to Gilles Thonet, deputy secretary general of the International Electrotechnical Commission, an industry group.",
      "\u201cTraditionally, power flowed in one direction: from large coal, gas or nuclear plants to homes and businesses,\" Thonet said. \u201cThese plants provided not only electricity, but also stability. Their spinning turbines acted like shock absorbers, smoothing out fluctuations in supply and demand.\u201d",
      "In the days following the blackout, Google searches in Spain for \u201cnuclear\u201d spiked, according to data from Google Trends.",
      "Spain\u2019s nuclear lobby group Foro Nuclear said this week that the government should rethink its plan to decommission its nuclear reactors after the outage. Ignacio Araluce, its president, said the nuclear plants online before the outage \u201cprovide firmness and stability.\u201d",
      "Others say it is too soon to draw conclusions about what role nuclear energy should play.",
      "\u201cWe do not know the cause of the oscillations,\u201d said Pedro Fresco, director general of Avaesen, an association of renewable energy and clean technology firms in Valencia. \u201cTherefore, we do not know what would have allowed them to be controlled.\u201d",
      "Spain\u2019s grid operator last week narrowed down the source of the outage to two separate incidents in which substations in southwestern Spain failed.",
      "Environment Minister Sara Aagesen said earlier this week that the grid had initially withstood another power generation outage in southern Spain 19 seconds before the blackout.",
      "S\u00e1nchez in his speech to Parliament said there was \"no empirical evidence\u201d to show that more nuclear power on the grid could have prevented a blackout or allowed the country to get back online faster. In fact, the four nuclear facilities online on April 28 before the blackout were taken offline after the outage as part of emergency protocol to avoid overheating.",
      "He said that nuclear energy \"has not been shown to be an effective solution in situations like what we experienced on April 28,\" and called the debate surrounding his government's nuclear phase-out plan \u201ca gigantic manipulation.\u201d",
      "Gas and hydropower, as well as electricity transfers from Morocco and France, were used to get the country's grid back online.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised tests of short-range ballistic missile systems that simulated nuclear counterstrikes against U.S. and South Korean forces, state media said Friday, as the North continued to blame its rivals for escalating tensions through their joint military exercises.",
      "The report came a day after South Korea\u2019s military detected multiple launches from North Korea\u2019s eastern coast and assessed that the tests could also be related to the country\u2019s weapons exports to Russia during its war in Ukraine.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday\u2019s tests involved a mobile ballistic missile system apparently modeled after Russia\u2019s Iskander, as well as 600-millimeter multiple rocket launchers that South Korean officials classify as ballistic due to their self-propulsion and guided flight. Both are part of a growing lineup of weapons systems that the North says could be armed with \u201ctactical\u201d nuclear weapons for battlefield use.",
      "KCNA said the tests were intended to train military units operating missile and rocket systems to more effectively execute attacks under the North\u2019s nuclear weapons control system and ensure a swift response to a nuclear crisis.",
      "The agency criticized the United States and its \u201cvassal states\u201d for expanding joint military exercises on and around the Korean Peninsula, which the North claims are preparations for nuclear war, and said Thursday\u2019s launches demonstrated the \u201crapid counteraction posture\u201d of its forces.",
      "Kim stressed the need to strengthen the role of his nuclear forces in both deterring and fighting war, and called for continued efforts to improve combat readiness and precision strike capabilities, KCNA said.",
      "Kim Inae, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, described the latest North Korean launches as a \u201cclear act of provocation\u201d that violates UN Security Council resolutions and poses a serious threat to peace and stability in the region.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said multiple missiles of various types were launched from the area around the eastern port city of Wonsan on Thursday from about 8:10 to 9:20 a.m., with the farthest traveling about 800 kilometers (497 miles).",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs, said in a briefing the North Korean launches were possibly intended to test the performance of weapons it plans to export, as the country continues to send military equipment and troops to fuel Russia\u2019s warfighting against Ukraine.",
      "Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters that none of the North Korean missiles reached Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone and there was no damage to vessels or aircraft in the area.",
      "It was the North\u2019s first known ballistic activity since March 10, when it fired several ballistic missiles hours after U.S. and South Korean troops began an annual combined military exercise, and the country\u2019s sixth launch event of the year.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have escalated in recent months as North Korean leader Kim continues to accelerate the development of his nuclear and missile program and supply weapons and troops to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "Thursday\u2019s launch came a day after North Korean state media said Kim urged munition workers to boost the production of artillery shells amid his deepening alignment with Moscow.",

      "Trabelsi, who is Jewish and served as Tunisia\u2019s tourism minister from 2018 to 2020, said little was known about the attacker, adding he did not assume it had to do with religion or the holiday, but would await findings from Tunisian authorities about potential motives.",

      "LIMA, Peru -- Peruvians were elated Thursday after a Catholic cardinal who spent years guiding the faithful in the South American country and they see as one of their own was elected pope.",
      "Pope Leo XIV is a dual citizen of the United States and Peru, where he first served as a missionary and then as an archbishop. That made him the first pope from each country.",
      "In Peru's capital, Lima, the bells of the cathedral rang after Cardinal Robert Prevost was announced as Pope Francis' successor. People outside the church quickly expressed their desire for a papal visit.",
      "\u201cFor us Peruvians, it is a source of pride that this is a pope who represents our country,\u201d said elementary school teacher Isabel Panez, who was near the cathedral when the news was announced. \u201cWe would like him to visit us here in Peru.\u201d",
      "Leo, standing on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for the first time as pope, addressed in Spanish the people of Chiclayo, which sits just 9 miles (14 kilometers) from Peru\u2019s northern Pacific coast and is among the country\u2019s most populous cities.",
      "\u201cGreetings... to all of you, and in particular, to my beloved diocese of Chiclayo in Peru, where a faithful people have accompanied their bishop, shared their faith,\u201d he said.",
      "Thomas Nicolini, a Peruvian who studies economics in Rome, said he went to St. Peter\u2019s Square as soon as he heard Prevost was the new pope.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful area, but one of the regions that needs lots of hope,\" he said referring to Chiclayo. \"So, now I\u2019m expecting that the new pope helps as many people as possible, and tries to reignite, let\u2019s say, the faith young people have lost.\u201d",
      "Diana Celis, who attended several Masses officiated by Prevost in Chiclayo, told The Associated Press that he would often repeat that he had \u201ccome from Chicago to Chiclayo, the only difference is a few letters.\u201d",
      "Born in Chicago in 1955, Prevost has held Peruvian nationality since 2015, Peru's national register agency confirmed Thursday. In 2014, he served as the administrator and later archbishop of Chiclayo and remained in that position until Francis summoned him to Rome in 2023 to serve as the powerful head of the office that vets bishop nominations from around the world, one of the most important jobs in the Catholic Church.",

      "Janinna Sesa, who met Prevost while she worked for the church\u2019s Caritas nonprofit, said he is the kind of person who will \u201cput on boots and wade through the mud\u201d to help those most in need. She said he did just that in 2022, when torrential rains affected Chiclayo and nearby villages.",
      "He also delivered food and blankets to the remote Andean villages, driving a white pickup truck and sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor. In those villages, Sesa said, Prevost ate whatever was offered to him, including the peasant diet consisting of potatoes, cheese and sweet corn. But, if the opportunity came up, he would enjoy carne asada \u2013 one of his favorite dishes \u2013 accompanied by a glass of Coca-Cola.",
      "\u201cHe has no problem fixing a broken-down truck until it runs,\u201d she said, highlighting his automotive interest.",

On Thursday, he ascended to become Pope Leo XIV \u2014 the first pontiff from the United States.",
      "Prevost, 69, had to overcome the taboo against an American pope, given the geopolitical power already wielded by the U.S. in the secular sphere.",
      "The Chicago native is also a Peruvian citizen and lived for years in Peru, first as a missionary and then as an archbishop.",
      "He evoked his broad experience in his first public remarks as pope, speaking in Italian, then switching to Spanish \u2014 and saying not a word in English as he addressed the crowd in Saint Peter's Square.",
      "He had prominence going into the conclave that few other cardinals have.",
      "Prevost was twice elected prior general, or top leader, of the Augustinians, the 13th century religious order founded by St. Augustine. Francis clearly had an eye on him for years, moving him from the Augustinian leadership back to Peru in 2014 to serve as the administrator and later archbishop of Chiclayo.",
      "He remained in that position, acquiring Peruvian citizenship in 2015, until Francis brought him to Rome in 2023 to assume the presidency of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. In that job he would have kept in regular contact with the Catholic hierarchy in the part of the world that counts the most Catholics.",
      "Ever since arriving in Rome, Prevost has kept a low public profile, but he was well known to the men who count.",
      "Significantly, he presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms Francis made, when he added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to forward to the pope. In early 2025, Francis again showed his esteem by appointing Prevost to the most senior rank of cardinals.",
      "The selection of a U.S.-born pope could have profound impact on the future of the U.S. Catholic Church, which has been sharply divided between conservatives and progressives. Francis, with Prevost\u2019s help at the help of the bishop vetting office, had embarked on a 12-year project to rein in the traditionalist tendencies in the United States.",
      "Prevost's election \u201cis a deep sign of commitment to social issues. I think it is going to be exciting to see a different kind of American Catholicism in Rome,\u2019\u2019 said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a professor of religious studies at Manhattan University in New York City.",
      "The bells of the cathedral in Peru\u2019s capital of Lima tolled after Prevost's election was announced. People outside the church expressed their desire for a papal visit at one point.",
      "\u201cFor us Peruvians, it is a source of pride that this is a pope who represents our country,\u201d said elementary school teacher Isabel Panez, who happened to be near the cathedral when the news was announced. \u201cWe would like him to visit us here in Peru.\u201d",

      "The talks in Ankara are expected to focus on a new peace effort between Turkey and a Kurdish militant group that has a foothold in Iraq, as well as water supplies to Iraq. Erdogan\u2019s office said that Turkish and Iraqi officials will ink a series of cooperation agreements during the visit.",
      "Relations between Turkey and Iraq were often strained over Turkish military incursions into northern Iraq for operations against the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, and the establishment of Turkish military bases there. Baghdad frequently condemned the incursions as a violation of its sovereignty.",
      "More recently, however, the two countries have deepened cooperation on security, including addressing the PKK presence in northern Iraq. Erdogan visited Baghdad last year for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "Also last year, Iraq announced that the Iraqi National Security Council had issued a ban on the PKK, although it stopped short of designating it as a terrorist organization.",
      "The visit comes after the PKK\u2019s jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, called on his group to dissolve and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey. The group declared a unilateral ceasefire in March and is now expected to hold a congress in northern Iraq, during which it would announce its dissolution, Turkish officials have said.",

      "Suzuki did not invite Israel to the 2024 anniversary, citing concern of \u201cunforeseeable situations\u201d such as violent protests over the war in Gaza disrupting the memorial.

      "In a message this week, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune framed commemoration as a matter of national pride and called the event a prelude to Algeria\u2019s fight for independence.",
      "\u201cThe commemoration of May 8 reflects the Algerians\u2019 commitment to freedom and dignity, for which they took to the streets with bare hands to confront an enemy,\u201d Tebboune said, calling French colonialism \u201cgenocidal\u201d and a crime against humanity.",
      "More than 500,000 tirailleurs from North Africa, West Africa and Madagascar fought for France during WWII. Some volunteered, others were forcibly conscripted. Many lost their lives. Across the board, they were generally paid less than European soldiers.",
      "Many Algerian veterans believed their service would lead to greater rights. But when the war ended, Algerians who dared to demand them were met with repression and violence, even as French leader Gen. Charles De Gaulle exalted how \u201cthe cause of liberty and justice\u201d had prevailed in a radio broadcast throughout France and its colonies, including Algeria.",
      "On May 8, 1945, Algerians filled city streets in Ain Temouchent, Guelma, Kherrata and Setif, waving flags and reviving pre-war calls for independence. After demonstrators faced police fire, anti-French riots broke out, killing more than 100. France subsequently launched an air and ground offensive that killed thousands of Algerians \u2014 45,000, according to Algerian authorities, and around 3,000, according to French statistics.",
      "The war's ending sparked similar disenchantment in Britain\u2019s colonies in East and West Africa, where more than 375,000 men enlisted. Soldiers who returned home expecting to be rewarded for their service instead faced racism and a continued lack of political representation. Both helped fuel the subsequent Mau Mau rebellion against British rule in Kenya, during which tens of thousands were killed.",
      "In recent years, memorials there as well as in South Africa have honored the service of African veterans. Elsewhere, including in Senegal, they\u2019ve commemorated injustice and violence that many endured post-war.",

      "The massacres have been debated in popular books and films in Algeria and France and are a recurring theme when tensions flare between the two countries.",
      "Tebboune and Macron announced a truth commission-style \u201cdossier de memoire\u201d in 2022, led by a committee of historians from both countries. However its activities have stalled as relations deteriorated over issues such as immigration and how France\u2019s juggles ties between Algeria and its regional rival Morocco.",
      "French leaders, including Macron, have called for truth and recognition but stopped short of fulfilling Algeria\u2019s demands for a formal state apology for the massacres.",

      "Lawmakers in Europe voted have voted to downgrade protections for wolves across the European Union in a victory for farmers over environmentalists",
      "BARCELONA -- Lawmakers in Europe voted Thursday to downgrade protections for wolves across the European Union's 27 states in a victory for farmers over environmentalists.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the European Parliament meeting in Strasbourg, France voted to change wolves' status from \u2018strictly protected\u2019 to \u2019protected' in a vote of 371 to 162, with 37 abstentions.",
      "Centrist and right-wing groups celebrated the vote.",
      "\u201cFarmers can now breathe a sigh of relief,\" said Herbert Dorfmann, a spokesperson for the European People\u2019s Party, a coalition of center-right groups in the EU. Right-wing Dutch politician Sander Smit said on Twitter: \u201cThis is fantastic news.\"",
      "Environmental groups criticized the decision as politically motivated rather than scientifically grounded.",
      "\u201cThis is a sad day for biodiversity and wild animals,\u201d said L\u00e9a Badoz at the Eurogroup for Animals. Joanna Swabe, a spokesperson for Humane World for Animals, called for individual governments to increase national protection for wolves.",
      "Politician Jutta Paulus from the parliament's Greens party said the campaign to reduce the wolves' protection \u201cborrows from the Donald Trump playbook\u201d and \u201cignores scientific evidence and attacks legislation which has been proven to work for decades for no clear gain other than the scoring of cheap populistic points.\"",
      "Tuesday's vote was the final real hurdle before the measure becomes EU law. The change to the central Habitats Directive law will now likely be passed swiftly by the European Council and enter into force across the 27 member states.",
      "Once deemed necessary to combat threats to the apex predator, restrictions on hunting wolves have over the past few years lost public support as many EU environmental rules and regulations have come under pressure in recent years. Populist and extreme-right parties have criticized the measures as being thought up by urban elites with little knowledge of rural life.",
      "Farmers in many member states have been increasingly angered by attacks on livestock by packs of wolves that have thrived in woods and fields close to agricultural land.",
      "The political movement to ease rules on killing wolves was given top-level support by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. An ardent fan of horses, von der Leyen had a pony Dolly that was killed by a wolf three years ago.",
      "Last year, more than 50 European nations from Turkey to Iceland voted to change the biodiversity treaty known as the Bern Convention to curtail protections for wolves.",
      "Experts and environmental groups estimate there could be up to 19,000 wolves across Europe, with large populations thought to roam in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania and Spain. After nearly being wiped out in the 20th century, their numbers are estimated to have grown by at least 25% over the last decade.",
      "Programs around the world to protect wolves have been shown to benefit local ecosystems. Yellowstone National Park in the United States said reintroducing wolves in 1995 had led to a better regulated food chain that helped drive a bump in forest cover and animal populations. Yet American states like Wyoming and Montana have passed similar bills allowing for more killing of wolves, driven as in Europe by politics mixing agitated farmers and safety concerns.",
      "\u201cWolves are vital to healthy ecosystems, but today\u2019s vote treats them as a political problem, not an ecological asset\u201d, said Ilaria Di Silvestre, Director of Policy and Advocacy for Europe at International Fund for Animal Welfare. \u201cThe EU was once proud to lead on nature protection. Now we are seeing vital species like the wolf sacrificed for short-term political interests that will benefit no one.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Commercial fishermen are eager to see if President Donald Trump's command to shed federal fishing regulations will boost one of the nation's oldest industries",
      "STONINGTON, Maine -- Virginia Olsen has pulled lobsters from Maine's chilly Atlantic waters for decades while watching threats to the state's lifeblood industry mount.",
      "Trade imbalances with Canada, tight regulations on fisheries and offshore wind farms towering like skyscrapers on open water pose three of those threats, said Olsen, part of the fifth generation in her family to make a living in the lobster trade.",
      "That's why she was encouraged last month when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that promises to restore American fisheries to their former glory. The order promises to shred fishing regulations, and Olsen said that will allow fishermen to do what they do best \u2014 fish.",
      "That will make a huge difference in communities like her home of Stonington, the busiest lobster fishing port in the country, Olsen said. It's a tiny island town of winding streets, swooping gulls and mansard roof houses with an economy almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing, some three hours up the coast from Portland, Maine's biggest city.",
      "Olsen knows firsthand how much has changed over the years. Hundreds of fish and shellfish populations globally have dwindled to dangerously low levels, alarming scientists and prompting the restrictions and catch limits that Trump's order could wash away with the stroke of a pen. But she's heartened that the livelihoods of people who work the traps and cast the nets have become a priority in faraway places where they often felt their voices weren't heard.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s time to have the conversation on what regulations that the industry does need. We\u2019re fishing different than we did 100 years ago,\" she said. \u201cIf everything is being looked at, we should be looking at the regulations within the fishing industry.\u201d",
      "But if fishing and lobstering interests finally have a seat at the table, the questions become how much seafood can be served there \u2014 and for how long. Trump's April 17 order, called \u201cRestoring American Seafood Competitiveness,\u201d promises an overhaul of the way America fishes, and cites a national seafood trade deficit of more than $20 billion as the reason to do it. The order calls on the federal government to reduce the regulatory burden on fishermen by later this month.",
      "It arrives at a time when conservation groups and many marine scientists say the ocean needs more regulation, not less. One oft-cited 2020 study led by a scientist at the University of British Columbia looked at more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations and found that 82% were below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields. The university said the study \u201cdiscovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species.\u201d",
      "Trump's order prioritizes commerce over conservation. It also calls for the development of a comprehensive seafood trade strategy and a review of existing marine monuments, which are underwater protected zones, to see if any should be opened for fishing. At least one, the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, has already been reopened.",
      "Many commercial fishermen and fishing trade groups lauded the order. Members of the industry, one of the oldest in the country, have long made the case that heavy regulations \u2014 many intended to protect the health of fish populations \u2014 leave the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to the fleets of countries that don't bear the same kind of burden. That disadvantage is a big piece of why America imports more than two-thirds of its seafood, they argue.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s executive order recognizes the challenges our fishing families and communities face, and we appreciate the commitment to reduce burdensome regulations and strengthen the competitiveness of American seafood,\u201d said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association.",
      "Some fishermen, including Maine lobsterman Don McHenan, said they're looking forward to members of the industry being able to fish in areas of the ocean that have been closed off to them for years. McHenan said he's also hopeful the pace of new regulations will slow.",
      "\u201cAs long as they don't put any more onto us,\u201d McHenan said. \u201cWe'll see \u2014 time will tell.\u201d",
      "But the support for deregulation is not unanimous among fishermen. Some say strong conservation laws are critical to protecting species that fishermen rely on to make a living.",
      "In Alaska, for example, Matt Wiebe said the executive order \u201cterrifies\u201d him. A commercial fisherman with more than 50 years of experience fishing for salmon, he said the order could potentially harm the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery, which has received praise from sustainability organizations for careful management of the fish supply.",
      "Absent that management, he said the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery could go the way of the New England cod fishing business, which collapsed due in large part to overfishing and has never recovered.",
      "\u201cSince New England fishers lost their cod fishery due to overfishing, many other fisheries came to respect and depend on conservation efforts,\u201d Wiebe said. \u201cWe fish because it's what we do, and conservation efforts mean we and our kids can fish into the future.\u201d",
      "The executive order arrived at a time when America's commercial fishermen are coping with environmental challenges and the decline of some once-marketable species. Maine's historic shrimp fishery shuttered more than a decade ago, California's salmon industry is struggling through closures and the number of fish stocks on the federal overfished list has grown in recent years.",
      "There is also the looming question of what Trump's trade war with major seafood producers such as Canada and China will mean for the U.S. industry \u2014 not to mention American consumers.",
      "To many in Maine's lobster and fishing business, the answer is clear: Cut regulations and let them do their thing.",
      "\u201cWe definitely feel the industry is over-regulated as a whole,\" said Dustin Delano, a fourth-generation Maine lobsterman who is also chief operating officer of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association. \u201cWe hope that this will help for sure. It does seek to initiate that America-first strategy in the fishery.\u201d",

      "But the world's two biggest economies are at odds over a raft of issues, including colliding strategic interests that will likely impede progress in the talks.",
      "Some of the punitive tariffs, including Beijing's retaliatory 125% tariffs on U.S. exports, could be rolled back, but a full reversal is unlikely, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",

      "China\u2019s politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States was nearly $20.5 billion in April, down from about $27.2 billion a year earlier. In the first four months of the year, China's exports to the United States fell 2.5% from a year earlier, while imports from the U.S. fell 4.7%.",

Shipments to India jumped nearly 16% by value, and exports to Africa surged 15%.",
      "Some of the fastest growth was in Asia, reflecting moves by Chinese and other manufacturers to diversify their supply chains outside of the Chinese mainland.",
      "Exports to Vietnam jumped 18% year-on-year, while exports to Thailand were up 20%.",
      "Measured on a monthly basis, China's total exports rose just 0.6% in April, while imports increased by nearly 4% from March.",

The town of about 3,000 people is near a mine that produced asbestos dust for decades, and the clinic has been at the forefront of efforts to help victims.",
      "Courts in Montana have said BNSF contributed to the pollution when it brought contaminated material from the mine through town, and the railway separately faces numerous lawsuits from asbestos victims in Libby and surrounding communities.",
      "But the Texas-based railway prevailed in a 2023 lawsuit alleging the clinic fraudulently made some patients eligible for government benefits when it knew they were not sick. The railway challenged the validity of over 2,000 diagnoses by the clinic and 337 were ruled false.",
      "The railway brought the lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, which provides specialized Medicare services to Libby\u2019s asbestos victims. BNSF was entitled to a share of the $6 million judgment against the clinic, and after adding in attorney fees, court costs and interest, the railway says it\u2019s now owed $3.1 million.",

Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. products. Meanwhile, Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.",

      "On his first day in office, Trump also says he expects to put 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting on Feb. 1, while declining to immediately flesh out plans for taxing Chinese imports.",
      "Trump threatens 25% tariffs on all Colombia imports and other retaliatory measures after President Gustavo Petro\u2019s rejects two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants to the country, accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation.",
      "In response, Petro also announces a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. But Colombia later reversed its decision and accepted the flights carrying migrants. The two countries soon signaled a halt in the trade dispute.",
      "Trump signs an executive order to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China \u2014 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 4. Trump invoked this power by declaring a national emergency \u2014 ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "The action prompts swift outrage from all three countries, with promises of retaliatory measures.",
      "Trump agrees to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada, as both trading partners take steps to appease Trump's concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "Trump's new 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports to the U.S. still go into effect. China retaliates the same day by announcing a flurry of countermeasures, including new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.",
      "China's 15% tariffs on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% levy on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S., take effect Feb. 10.",
      "Trump announces plans to hike steel and aluminum tariffs starting March 12. He removes the exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on steel, meaning that all steel imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, and also raises his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%.",
      "Trump announces a plan for \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 promising to increase U.S. tariffs to match the tax rates that countries worldwide charge on imports \u201cfor purposes of fairness.\u201d Economists warn that the reciprocal tariffs, set to overturn decades of trade policy, could create chaos for global businesses.",
      "Trump signs an executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether a tariff on imported copper is needed to protect national security. He cites the material's use in U.S. defense, infrastructure and emerging technologies.",
      "Trump signs an additional executive order instructing the Commerce Department to consider whether tariffs on lumber and timber are also needed to protect national security, arguing that the construction industry and military depend on a strong supply of wooden products in the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico go into effect, though he limits the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. He also doubles the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20%.",
      "All three countries promise retaliatory measures. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces tariffs on more than $100 billion of American goods over the course of 21 days. And Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her country would respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods without specifying the targeted products immediately, signaling hopes to de-escalate.",
      "China, meanwhile, imposes tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of key U.S. farm exports, set to take effect March 10. It also expands the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",
      "Trump grants a one-month exemption on his new tariffs impacting goods from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers. The pause arrives after the president spoke with leaders of the \u201cBig 3\u201d automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.",
      "In a wider extension, Trump postpones 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada for a month.",
      "Trump credited Sheinbaum with making progress on border security and drug smuggling as a reason for again pausing tariffs. His actions also thaw relations with Canada somewhat, although outrage and uncertainty remains. Still, after its initial retaliatory tariffs of $30 billion Canadian (US$21 billion) on U.S. goods, the government says it's suspended a second wave of retaliatory tariffs worth $125 billion Canadian (US$87 billion).",
      "China's retaliatory 15% tariffs on key American farm products \u2014 including chicken, pork, soybeans and beef \u2014 take effect. Goods already in transit are set to be exempt through April 12, per China\u2019s Commerce Ministry previous announcement.",
      "Trump's new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports go into effect. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board \u2014 with Trump\u2019s order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminum\u2019s levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes.",
      "The European Union takes retaliatory trade action promising new duties on U.S. industrial and farm products. The measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion), and not just steel and aluminum products, but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. Motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans will be hit, as they were during Trump\u2019s first term. The 27-member bloc later says it will delay this retaliatory action until mid-April.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, announces plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs worth Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) on U.S. imports, set to go into effect March 13.",
      "Trump threatens a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with its previously-announced plans for a 50% tariff on American whiskey.",
      "Trump says he will place a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, in addition to imposing new tariffs on the South American country itself, starting April 2.",
      "The tariffs would most likely add to the taxes facing China, which in 2023 bought 68% of the oil exported by Venezuela, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a number of countries also receive oil from Venezuela \u2014 including the United States itself.",
      "Trump says he is placing 25% tariffs on auto imports. These auto imports will start being collected April 3 \u2014 beginning with taxes on fully-imported cars. The tariffs are set to then expand to applicable auto parts in the following weeks, through May 3.",
      "Trump announces his long-promised \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports across the board starting April 5, as well as higher rates for dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S. to take effect April 9.",
      "Among those steeper levies, Trump says the U.S. will now charge a 34% tax on imports from China, a 20% tax on imports from the European Union, 25% on South Korea, 24% on Japan and 32% on Taiwan. The new tariffs come on top of previously-imposed levies, including the 20% tax Trump announced on all Chinese imports earlier this year.",
      "Meanwhile, for Canada and Mexico, the White House says USMCA-compliant imports can continue to enter the U.S. duty-free. Once the two countries have satisfied Trump\u2019s demands on immigration and drug trafficking, the White House adds, the tariff on the rest of their imports may drop from 25% to 12%.",
      "Trump's previously-announced auto tariffs begin. Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will match the 25% levies with a tariff on vehicles imported from the U.S.",
      "China announces plans to impose a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10, matching Trump's new \"reciprocal\u201d tariff on Chinese goods, as part of a flurry of retaliatory measures.",
      "The Commerce Ministry in Beijing says it will also impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries. And the government adds 27 firms to lists of companies subject to trade sanctions or export controls.",
      "Trump's 10% minimum tariff on nearly all countries and territories takes effect.",
      "Trump's higher \u201creciprocal\u201d rates go into effect, hiking taxes on imports from dozens of countries just after midnight. But hours later, his administration says it will suspend most of these higher rates for 90 days, while maintaining the recently-imposed 10% levy on nearly all global imports.",
      "China is the exception. After following through on a threat to raise levies against China to a total of 104%, Trump says he will now raise those import taxes to 125% \u201ceffective immediately\u201d \u2014 escalating tit-for-tat duties that have piled up between the two countries. The White House later clarifies that total tariffs against China are actually now 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs are accounted for.",
      "China upped its retaliation prior to this announcement \u2014 vowing to tax American goods at 84% starting April 10. Also earlier, EU member states vote to approve their own retaliatory levies on 20.9 billion euros ($23 billion) of U.S. goods in response to Trump\u2019s previously-imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. The EU\u2019s executive commission doesn\u2019t immediately specify which imports it will tax, but notes its counter tariffs will come in stages \u2014 with some set to arrive on April 15, and others May 15 and Dec. 1.",
      "Separately, Canada's counter tariffs on auto imports take effect. The country implements a 25% levy on auto imports from the U.S. that do not comply with the 2020 USMCA pact.",
      "The EU puts its steel and aluminum tariff retaliation on hold for 90 days, to match Trump's pause on steeper \u201creciprocal\u201d levies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the commission wants to give negotiations with the U.S. a chance \u2014 but warns countermeasures will kick in if talks \u201care not satisfactory.\u201d",
      "China says it will raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, in response to Trump's heightened levies. The new rate is set to begin April 12.",
      "Later, the Trump administration unveils that electronics, including smartphones and laptops, will be exempt from so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. But in the days following, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick signals that this is only a temporary reprieve, saying that sector-specific levies on semiconductors will arrive in \u201cprobably a month or two.\u201d And other, non-\"reciprocal\" tariffs that tax some electronics, notably from China, remain.",
      "Trump says he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.",
      "The Trump administration also launches investigations into imports of computer chips, chipmaking equipment and pharmaceuticals \u2014 signaling next steps toward imposing tariffs on these sectors. The U.S. Commerce Department posts notices about these probes, seeking public comment within the next three weeks.",
      "Separately, the Commerce Department says it's withdrawing from a 2019 agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation into fresh tomato imports from Mexico. That termination, set to take effect July 14, means most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff.",
      "Trump signs executive orders to relax some of his 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts \u2014 aimed at easing import taxes for vehicles that are made with foreign parts, but assembled in the U.S.",
      "For one year, the administration says it will provide a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales prices of a domestically-assembled car \u2014 a figure reached by putting the previously-imposed 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of that price. And for the second year, the rebate would equal 2.5% of the sales price, applying to a smaller share of the vehicle\u2019s parts.",
      "The latest round of Trump's auto tariffs takes effect. The previously-announced 25% levies now apply to a range of imported auto parts.",
      "Trump threatens a 100% tariff on foreign-made films, while claiming that the movie industry in the U.S. is dying. It isn't immediately clear how such a tariff on international productions could be implemented, but Trump says he's authorized the Commerce Department and the U.S. Trade Representative to \u201cimmediately begin the process.\u201d",
      "The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses tried to get ahead of Trump\u2019stariffs. Federal data showed an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit \u2014 which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys \u2014 has roughly doubled during the past year.",
      "Also, the U.S. government announced that top officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation over the weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Trump sparked a trade war. No country has been hit harder by Trump\u2019s trade war than China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter and second largest economy. U.S. tariffs against China are set at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%.",
      "The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged at 4.3%, saying that the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen due to uncertainty about how and when Trump\u2019s tariffs might impact the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell underscored that the tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and that there\u2019s currently too many unknowns to be able to predict how the Fed might adjust its monetary policy going forward.",
      "The United States and Britain announced a trade deal, potentially lowering the financial burden from tariffs while creating greater access abroad for American goods. The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., which would also streamline the processing of U.S. goods though customs. Trump said final details were being written up. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have it all very conclusive,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Britain said the deal will cut tariffs on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10%, with a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff. It also eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Separately, the European Union published a list of U.S. imports that it would target with retaliatory duties if no solution is found to end U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war. The EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, also said it would begin legal action at the World Trade Organization over the \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d that Trump imposed on countries around the world a month ago.",

      "The rate stood at 6.76% for the second week in a row, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 7.09%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, eased. The average rate dropped to 5.89% from 5.92% last week. It\u2019s down from 6.38% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors\u2019 expectations about the economy and inflation.",
      "After climbing to a just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6.62%, where it was just four weeks ago. It then spiked above 6.8% in the following two weeks and eased last week to 6.76%.",
      "The recent swings in mortgage rates reflect volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, surged last month to 4.5% amid a sell-off in government bonds triggered by investor anxiety over the Trump administration\u2019s trade war.",

      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices remain affordability hurdles for many would-be homebuyers. It\u2019s why the spring homebuying season is off to a lackluster start. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in March, posting the largest monthly drop since November 2022.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- In the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference, set to take place in Brazil\u2019s Amazon in November, the construction of a road is drawing attention, with critics arguing it will lead to environmental degradation.",
      "Before the talks, called COP30, the state government of Para is building a 13-kilometer (8-mile) avenue designed to ease traffic on a major highway that runs parallel.",
      "The road was planned long before Belem, a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people that sits on the edge of the Amazon, was chosen as conference host. That hasn't spared it sharp criticism, however, because the road is expected to cut across the last remnants of rainforest in Belem.",
      "Road building in the Amazon, which historically has often led to deforestation and development of surrounding areas, also stands in stark contrast to a central aim of climate conferences, and in particular this one: conservation of biodiversity.",
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has made the slowing of deforestation a central focus of his administration, has frequently boasted that this will be the first such conference in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "The Amazon is key to regulating the climate, because trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that heats the planet when released into the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cWe will hold the best COP in history because the topic of all the ones held in other countries was the Amazon,\" Lula said while visiting Belem worksites in February. \u201cThis one will be in the Amazon.\u201d",
      "An official project map shows a straight line dividing a green area through the city\u2019s outskirts. This protected area is slightly larger than Manhattan. It was designated in 1993 to protect two lakes, a river basin and to restore a degraded rainforest. However, its rules allow private properties, government-approved deforestation and public works. Two university campuses are located within its limits.",
      "\u201cEven with measures to reduce the damage, there are tough issues to address,\u201d said Roberta Rodrigues, a professor of architecture at the Federal University of Para. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a road being built along the banks of the Guama River without it leading to illegal development. It may lead to the end of this protected area.\"",
      "The project dates back to 2020. Construction began in mid-2024, despite criticism over its impact on one of the city\u2019s few remaining green areas. The project drew wider attention in March, when the BBC reported that the avenue was \"being built for COP30.\u201d As the story was picked up by news outlets around the world, Brazil\u2019s government issued a statement saying the avenue wasn't among the 33 infrastructure projects planned for COP30.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, the state government of Para said that the avenue, named Liberdade, or Freedom, will be an expressway and development around it won't be permitted.",
      "The chaotic growth of Brazilian cities, however, suggests it's a promise that will be hard to keep. Countless public areas have been occupied for the irregular construction of housing \u2014 from modest structures to luxury condos \u2014 with the expectation that they will eventually be legalized, which often ends up happening.",
      "Belem is the capital of Para, which is run by Gov. Helder Barbalho, a politician from a traditional family who is an ally of Lula. Both support oil drilling in the nearby mouth of the Amazon River, likely a point of contention during COP30.",

      "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) \u2014 India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since they gained independence from Britain in 1947. They\u2019ve also had dozens of skirmishes and conflicts, including one atop a glacier dubbed the coldest and highest-altitude battlefield in the world.",
      "The latest escalation follows a deadly gun attack on tourists that India blames Pakistan for \u2014 Islamabad denies any connection. But they don\u2019t fight wars like other countries.",
      "The dominant factor is their nuclear weapons arsenal, a distinct way of deterring major attacks and a guarantee that fighting doesn\u2019t get out of hand, even when the situation is spiraling.",
      "Here\u2019s how \u2014 and why \u2014 India and Pakistan fight the way they do:",
      "\u201cPakistan and India have enough nuclear weapons to wipe the other side out several times over,\u201d says security analyst Syed Mohammed Ali, who is based in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. \u201cTheir nuclear weapons create a scenario for mutually assured destruction.\u201d",
      "Both countries have \u201cdeliberately developed\u201d the size and range of their stockpile to remind the other about the guarantee of mutually assured destruction, he adds.",
      "Neither country discloses their nuclear capabilities but each is thought to have between 170 and 180 warheads that are short-, long- and medium-range. Both countries have different delivery systems \u2014 ways of launching and propelling these weapons to their targets.",
      "The arsenals are a defensive move to prevent and deter further fighting, because \u201cneither side can afford to initiate such a war or hope to achieve anything from it,\u201d Ali says.",
      "It might not look this way to the outsider, but nuclear weapons are a reminder to the other side that they can't take things too far.",
      "But the secrecy around their arsenals means that it's unclear if Pakistan or India can survive a first nuclear strike and retaliate, something called \u201csecond-strike capability.\u201d",
      "This capacity stops an opponent from attempting to win a nuclear war through a first strike by preventing aggression that could lead to nuclear escalation.",
      "Without this capability, there is, in theory, nothing to stop one side from launching a warhead at the other.",
      "India and Pakistan have each laid claim to Kashmir since 1947, when both gained independence, and border skirmishes have created instability in the region for decades. Each country controls a part of Kashmir, which is divided by a heavily militarized border.",
      "The two archrivals have also fought two of their three wars over Kashmir \u2014 a disputed Himalayan region divided between the them where armed insurgents resist Indian rule. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "Border flare-ups and militant attacks in India-controlled Kashmir have prompted New Delhi to take an increasingly tough position on Islamabad, accusing it of \u201cterrorism.\u201d",
      "In the latest conflict, India punished Pakistan by hitting what it said were sites used by Pakistan-backed militants linked to a gun massacre last month.",
      "India is one of the biggest defense spenders in the world, with $74.4 billion in 2025, according to the Military Balance report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. It\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s largest arms importers.",
      "Pakistan is no slouch, spending $10 billion last year, but it can never match India\u2019s deep pockets. India also has more than double the number of active armed forces personnel than Pakistan does.",
      "While India\u2019s armed forces are traditionally focused on Pakistan, it has another nuclear neighbor to contend with, China, and it is increasingly concerned with maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Those are two factors that Pakistan doesn\u2019t have to consider in its security paradigm.",
      "Pakistan's long and narrow shape, together with the outsized role of the military in foreign policy, makes it easier to move the armed forces around and prioritize defense.",
      "Neither Pakistan or India are in a hurry to announce their military moves against the other and, as seen in the current flare-up of hostilities, it can take a while for confirmation of strikes and retaliation to surface.",
      "But both launch operations into territories and airspace controlled by the other. Sometimes these are intended to damage checkpoints, installations, or sites allegedly used by militants.",
      "They are also aimed at embarrassing or provoking \u2014 forcing leaders to bow to public pressure and respond, with the potential for miscalculation.",
      "Many of these activities originate along the Line of Control, which divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. It's largely inaccessible to the media and public, making it hard to independently verify claims of an attack or retaliation.",
      "Such incidents raise international alarm, because both countries have nuclear capabilities, forcing attention back to India and Pakistan and, eventually, their competing claims over Kashmir.",
      "The fear of nuclear war has put the two countries at the top of the agenda, competing with the papal conclave, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, and the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs trial in the news cycle.",
      "Pakistan and India\u2019s battles and skirmishes are away from the public eye.",
      "Strikes and retaliation are late at night or early in the morning and, with the exception of the drone attacks on Thursday, they mostly take place away from densely populated urban centers. It shows that neither country has the desire to significantly harm the other\u2019s population. Attacks are either described as surgical or limited.",
      "Neither country is motivated by competition for resources. Pakistan has huge mineral wealth, but India isn't interested in these and, while there are stark ideological differences between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, they don\u2019t seek control or influence over the other.",

      "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies.",
      "Jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 to 228,000 for the week ending May 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s in line with the 229,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 decimated the economy and wiped out millions of jobs.",
      "Even though Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.",
      "A contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trump\u2019s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "It was the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.",
      "Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trump\u2019s promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce has occupied much of the early weeks of his presidency and is still in motion.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by Elon Musk \u2014 will surface in the weekly layoffs data. However, the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Last week the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%, however, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",
      "Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week gyrations, inched up by 1,000 to 227,000.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of April 26 fell to 1.88 million, a decrease of 29,000.",

      "Melinda French Gates says she and her ex-husband, Bill Gates, always intended for the foundation they started together to spend down all of its resources rather than to exist in perpetuity",
      "Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates.",
      "She petitioned heads of state and convened other billionaires. Along with Gates, she won the trust of one of America's most admired investors, Warren Buffett, who has given more than $43 billion to the former couple's foundation.",
      "French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure.",
      "At an ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, which also launched her new memoir, French Gates said she left, in part, to respond to the U.S. rollback of women\u2019s rights.",
      "\u201cI thought, I want to be much more nimble than this, and I want to be able to set the agenda by myself without having to ask anybody else, and do it with my partners,\u201d she said.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation\u2019s 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 2045. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\u201cUltimately, though,\" she wrote, \u201cthe timeline was Bill\u2019s decision to make with the board of trustees.\u201d",
      "The following responses have been edited for length.",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation\u2019s work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the Giving Pledge because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it\u2019s important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn\u2019t collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don\u2019t have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "A: When you\u2019re doing this kind of work, it doesn\u2019t take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn\u2019t use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn\u2019t fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn\u2019t buy it, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "A: It\u2019s easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn\u2019t ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

      "INDIAN WELLS, Ca. -- Bill Gates is pledging 99% of his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will spend it all within 20 years. The funds will be delivered over time and will allow the foundation to spend another $200 billion by the time it closes in 2045.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a little bit more that goes to the kids and some portion that, you know, I won\u2019t be wanting for anything for my consumption,\u201d Gates said. Even his climate-related investments, \u201call of the profits that come from that work go into the Gates Foundation.\u201d",
      "In interviews with The Associated Press, Gates spoke about the foundation\u2019s past work and future goals. His responses have been edited for length.",
      "\u201cI hope other people wallop me. Even today, there\u2019s probably a dozen people richer than I am, because I don\u2019t count the money that I\u2019ve already got in the foundation. I have just a bit over $100 billion outside of the foundation. I\u2019d love to be beat in all of this work. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than I\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone. It will be spent. Hopefully, many of these diseases are eradicated, so nobody even knows, \u2018What was malaria? What was polio?\u2019 in the years ahead. You know, some foundations, if they\u2019ve been around 50 or 60 years, who knows how their work relates to the intent of the person who started that foundation? And I do think there\u2019ll be more rich people in the future than there are today. So yes, it will create a vacuum in 20 years, and we\u2019re letting people know way in advance that\u2019s what this will look like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s by some measures the most generous gift ever given and a real vote of confidence from Warren, who\u2019s a great friend and has always given me phenomenal advice and is very driven by these inequity issues. And that was in 2006, and so it\u2019s two years later that I give up my full-time work at Microsoft, and I move over. And I\u2019ve been full time at the foundation since 2008 for the rest of my life. It\u2019s my final, second career. You know, Warren, it\u2019s hard to overstate the impact he\u2019s had on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was a big hope, that the societal expectation for anybody who has a lot of money would be that they give the majority of it away, and that basically everyone would join into that. Now, we\u2019re not at that level, but I think year by year, people are saying, \u2018Hey, the fairness of this system, the legitimacy of this system really benefits if those who both through skill and luck, the system has rewarded them, that they put a lot of their resources and even, some of their time and energy into improving society.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cMany things now are making it less clear how much progress we\u2019ll make in these 20 years we have remaining. The donors are being somewhat less generous as they feel squeezed by an aging population and demands for Ukraine, both refugee costs, defense costs, a lot of things. And so telling the story of the success and the moral and geopolitical value of taking 1% of rich country budgets and saying, \u2018No, this is to save lives for very, very, very little money.\u2019 We\u2019re going to have to renew people\u2019s understanding and prioritization of these things in order to keep that piece. We have a lot of things we\u2019re optimistic about because we have new tools, new ways of protecting women from getting HIV, new ways of killing mosquitoes... And so it\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them. So, it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",
      "\u201cMelinda has made a phenomenal contribution to the foundation, helping us pick the right people and being in partnerships, traveling the world, bringing her perspective to things. I can\u2019t say enough good things about how she got us off on the right track. When we divorced, we hoped \u2014 I hoped \u2014 that she would choose to stay. She stayed for a period of time, continued to do great work, and then chose to do the philanthropy on her own.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur work is for saving children\u2019s lives. So it\u2019s true, if they have other priorities, it\u2019s hard to influence my commitment to not having mothers bleed to death or kids not dying from malaria. To be honest, the number of civil society actors that are in here trying to influence the work we do is so tiny. It\u2019s unbelievable. I mean, I could almost list their names on one piece of paper. Where are these people? We want more people second-guessing our work, criticizing our work. I mean, what\u2019s their idea about malnutrition? What\u2019s their idea on how to deal with these funding cuts? What do they want us to do?\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health \u2014 an accomplishment that carried both accolades and controversy.",
      "Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates had grand ambitions for their foundation, but little experience in global health or philanthropy. They were moved by stories like those written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about children dying from diseases caused by a lack of sanitation. In characteristic Gates style, they tackled these problems with rigor, data and close oversight.",
      "As a result, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 formed in 2000 by the merger of two family foundations and funded by Gates\u2019 Microsoft wealth and later, by tens of billions from investor Warren Buffett \u2014 inserted itself into the architecture of global health.",
      "Along the way, the foundation\u2019s leaders redefined what it means to be philanthropists.",
      "\u201cAs I was learning about what children die of, you know, HIV and diarrhea and pneumonia, were all things that I was stunned how little was going into helping the poor countries,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He responded in a way few others could, by pouring billions into the foundation, which spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with about half going toward global health.",
      "Thanks to its largesse, as well as the expertise of its employees, its connections to governments and companies, and the profile of its founders, the Gates Foundation now garners at least the same influence, if not more, in almost any global health forum as many countries.",
      "That era now has an end date. Gates announced Thursday that the foundation will close in 2045, pledging that he plans to donate 99% of his remaining fortune, which would be $107 billion today, to the nonprofit by then. Gates said the foundation can maintain its culture and workforce over that time.",
      "\"We\u2019ll be showing that we\u2019re doing the most we can and give a lot of predictability to the field by (saying,) \u2018We\u2019ll be here all of those 20 years, but not thereafter,\u2019\" he said.",
      "The foundation's influence over global health policy and its partnerships with companies and other private sector actors have long drawn questions.",
      "Researcher Linsey McGoey, a professor of sociology at the University of Essex, who wrote the book \u201cNo Such Thing as a Free Gift \u201d about the foundation, asks how charitable it is to \u201cgive away\u201d money to a foundation the donor controls.",
      "Others like Anuj Kapilashrami, global health professor at the University of Essex, argue the foundation's preference for low-cost treatments and interventions does not inherently help build the capacity of health systems.",
      "\u201cWe do not tackle the causes, the underlying drivers of what is producing ill-health, but we choose areas and health issues where we can just push these magic bullets: commodities, drugs (and) bed nets,\u201d she said.",
      "Mark Suzman, who has been with the foundation for 18 years and CEO since 2020, said close supervision of grantees and the foundation\u2019s data-driven processes are key to its success.",
      "\u201cWe are not a 'write the check, call us in three years and let us know what it looks like,\u2019\u201d kind of funder, Suzman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be calling you up probably every week, and we\u2019ll have some opinions. But we want your opinions back.\u201d",
      "The foundation is proud of the many vaccines, medical devices and treatment protocols it has helped develop. It is optimistic about a pipeline of innovations, including potential vaccines for malaria and HIV, as possible accomplishments in its remaining 20 years.",
      "David McCoy, a physician who was then at the University College London, argued back in 2009 that only a small portion of the foundation\u2019s spending went directly to organizations located in the countries where they work, with most going to international organizations like the World Health Organization or to groups located in the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Suzman said he has been an internal champion of shifting more of the foundation's work from Seattle to in-country offices.",
      "The foundation\u2019s flagship issue, and the main way it measures its success, is in reducing preventable childhood deaths.",
      "The Gates Foundation helped establish two major public-private partnerships: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that funds and distributes vaccines for children, and the Global Fund, which, along with governments, funds the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.",
      "The foundation says the two organizations have saved tens of millions of lives and are some of the most important examples of its impact.",
      "However, Amy Patterson, politics professor at The University of the South, Sewanee, says public-private partnerships like Gavi and the Global Fund diminish the power of civil society groups and citizens compared to public health systems.",

      "\u201cThat is not to discount the millions of lives saved, or children immunized, or women who have access to reproductive health, or the innovations that have brought efficiency,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut if you think about the social contract between states taking care of their people, how do we have that same kind of accountability in this type of a system?\u201d",
      "A huge moment in the early history of the foundation came in 2006 when Buffett pledged to donate a percentage of his Berkshire Hathaway shares annually, almost doubling the foundation\u2019s resources.",
      "Buffett teamed with Gates and French Gates again in 2010 to launch a new commitment for billionaires: to give away more than half their money in their lifetimes or at the time of their death.",
      "The Giving Pledge now has more than 240 people agreeing to those terms, far exceeding Gates\u2019 expectations. However, certainly not every billionaire has.",
      "Gates hopes others will surpass his giving.",

      "He acknowledged that cuts to foreign aid and health funding under President Donald Trump's current administration, wars, and economic turmoil significantly challenge the foundation's hopes of eradicating polio, controlling malaria, and reducing the number of child and maternal deaths in the next 20 years.",
      "\u201cThe metric that we should be measured against is the success of the whole global health field. Did we draw people in? Did we keep governments engaged, and therefore, do we get childhood death rates down from the 5 million to cut it in half again?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you we will, because without the partners, that\u2019s not doable.

      "Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation",
      "SEATTLE -- SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. Today, that would be worth an estimated $107 billion.",
      "The pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever \u2013 outpacing the historic contributions of industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie when adjusted for inflation. Only Berkshire Hathaway investor Warren Buffett's pledge to donate his fortune \u2014 currently estimated by Forbes at $160 billion \u2014 may be larger depending on stock market fluctuations.",
      "Gates' donation will be delivered over time and allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. The foundation already has an endowment of $77 billion built from donations from Gates, Melinda French Gates and Buffett.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of thrilling to have that much to be able to put into these causes,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "His announcement Thursday signals both a promise of sustained support to those causes, particularly global health and education in the U.S., and an eventual end to the foundation\u2019s immense worldwide influence. Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundation's closure. It also makes it more likely that his intentions are honored.",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone,\u201d Gates said.",
      "In a league of its own",
      "The pledge is \u201ca welcome bit of boldness,\u201d at a time when optimism is in short supply said, Rhodri Davies, a philanthropy expert and author of the publication, \u201cPublic Good by Private Means.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis announcement seems like yet more evidence that norms in foundation philanthropy might be shifting\u201d away from a default of operating in perpetuity, he said.",
      "The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations \u2014 attracting supporters and detractors but also numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.",
      "In addition to the $100 billion it has spent since its founding 25 years ago, it has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies.",
      "About 41% of the foundation\u2019s money so far has come from Warren Buffett and the rest from the fortune Gates made at Microsoft.",
      "Started by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000, the foundation plays a significant role in shaping global health policy and has carved out a special niche by partnering with companies to drive down the cost of medical treatments so low- and middle-income countries could afford them.",
      "\u201cThe foundation work has been way more impactful than I expected,\u201d Gates said, calling it his second and final career.",
      "The foundation\u2019s influence on global health \u2014 from the World Health Organization to research agendas \u2014 is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism. For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves people\u2019s health and responds to crises.",
      "Gates said, like any private citizen, he can choose how to spend the money he earns and has decided to do everything he can to reduce childhood deaths.",
      "\u201cIs that a bad thing? It\u2019s not an important cause? People can criticize it,\u201d he said, but the foundation will stick to its global health work.",
      "The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and statehouses from Melinda French Gates\u2019 organization, Pivotal Ventures.",
      "Major ambitions for the remaining 20 years",
      "The foundation\u2019s most prized metric is the drop in childhood deaths from preventable causes by almost half between 2000 and 2020, according to United Nations figures. The foundation\u2019s CEO Mark Suzman is careful to say they do not take credit for this accomplishment. But he believes they had a \u201ccatalytic role\u201d \u2014 for example, in helping deliver vaccines to children through Gavi, the vaccine alliance they helped create.",
      "The foundation still has numerous goals \u2014 eradicating polio, controlling other deadly diseases, like malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which makes children more vulnerable to other illnesses.",
      "Gates hopes that by spending to address these issues now, wealthy donors will be free to tackle other problems later.",
      "The Gates Foundation had planned to wind down two decades after Gates' death, meaning today\u2019s announcement significantly moves up that timetable. Gates plans to stay engaged, though at 69, he acknowledged he may not have a say.",
      "In its remaining two decades, the foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year, which represents a leveling off from its almost annual growth since 2006, when Buffett first started donating.",
      "Suzman expects the foundation will narrow its focus to top priorities.",
      "\u201cHaving that time horizon and the resources just puts an even greater burden on us to say, \u2018Are you actually putting your resources, your thumb down, on what are going to be the biggest, most successful bets rather than scattering it too thinly?\u2019\" Suzman said, which he acknowledged was creating uncertainty even within the foundation about what programs would continue.",
      "Gates is the only remaining founder",
      "Major changes preceded the foundation's 25th year.",
      "In 2021, Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates divorced, and Buffett resigned as the foundation\u2019s trustee. They recruited a new board of trustees to help govern the foundation, and in 2024, French Gates left to continue work at her own organization.",
      "French Gates said she decided to step down partly to focus on countering the rollback of women\u2019s rights in the U.S. At the ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, she said she wanted to leave the foundation at a high point.",
      "\u201cI so trusted Mark Suzman, the current CEO,\" she said. \u201cWe had a board in place that I helped put in place, and I knew their values.\u201d",
      "Even as the foundation\u2019s governance stabilizes, the road ahead looks difficult. Enduring conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, global economic turmoil and cuts to foreign aid forecast fewer resources coming to global health and development.",
      "\u201cThe greatest uncertainty for us is the generosity that will go into global health,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWill it continue to go down like it has the last few years or can we get it back to where it should be?\u201d",
      "Even facing these obstacles, Gates and the foundation speak, as they often do, with optimism, pointing to innovations they\u2019ve funded or ways they\u2019ve helped reduce the cost of care.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them,\u201d Gates said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- When it comes to Medicaid, Rep. Juan Ciscomani is telling fellow Republicans he won't support steep cuts that could hit thousands of residents in his Arizona district \u2014 \u201cmy neighbors, people my kids go to school with\u201d \u2014 who depend on it.",

      "While it\u2019s often the most conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus driving the legislative agenda \u2014 and they are demanding as much as $2 trillion in cuts \u2014 it\u2019s the more centrist-leaning conservatives who could sink the bill. They have been hauled into meetings with Trump at the White House, some have journeyed to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and many are huddling almost daily with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "And they are not satisfied, yet.",
      "\u201cTo get everybody politically and policy-wise on the same page is going to require more conversations,\u201d said LaLota, who is among five Republicans pledging to withhold their support unless changes to the SALT deduction are included.",
      "Diving into the gritty details of the massive package, the GOP leaders are running into the stubborn reality that not all the ideas from their menu of potential tax breaks and spending cuts are popular with voters back home.",
      "Moreover, their work of compiling the big package is not happening in a vacuum. It comes amid growing economic unease rippling across the country as Trump has fired thousands of federal workers, including some of their own constituents, and as his trade war sparks concerns of empty store shelves and higher prices.",
      "Brendan Buck, a former adviser to an earlier House speaker, Paul Ryan, warned in an op-ed Wednesday that all the party's energy is being poured into one bill, with questionable returns.",
      "\"Many Republicans are hoping that the tax bill can blunt the economic damage caused by the Trump tariffs,\" Buck wrote in The New York Times, \u201cbut that is highly unlikely.\u201d",

      "The speaker's office has become a waystation with a revolving door of Republicans privately laboring to piece together the massive package.",
      "So far, GOP leaders have signaled they are walking away from some, but not all, of the steep Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the proposals could result in millions of people losing their coverage.",
      "Instead, what appears to still be on the table are tougher work requirements for those receiving Medicaid and food stamp assistance and more frequent eligibility tests for beneficiaries.",
      "That's not enough for the conservatives, who also number in the dozens and are insisting on deeper reductions.",

I think it\u2019s very important they know that.\u201d",

      "The road to the U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement was paved with challenges",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Last fall, weeks before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy floated a pitch that proposed, among other things,\u202fan economic deal that would allow Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s largely untapped minerals and deepen strategic ties.",
      "Under pressure from Western allies and amid global war fatigue, Zelenskyy saw that the days of Biden administration-era robust military aid might be numbered, and so the pitch was part of the Ukrainian leader\u2019s so-called victory plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It was an offer that would appeal to Trump\u2019s penchant for transactions-based diplomacy in hopes of ensuring a steady flow of future American support in return.",
      "Seven months later, a landmark deal between Ukraine and the Trump administration on Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources was inked. But the road in between was paved with mutual recriminations, a historic Oval Office blowout, \u201chundreds\u201d of revisions, and finally, a chance meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral.",
      "Last minute snags threatened to undermine the signing of the agreement, but in the end Ukraine secured a deal that, once set in motion, brings closer ties with the U.S. and a provides a vehicle for future military assistance.\u202f Ukraine\u2019s parliament is expected to pass the agreement on Thursday, and other documents pertaining to the deal are being finalized.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that this is the first time in history that the United States considers Ukraine as a long-term strategic partner, economically,\u201d Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said at a media briefing in Kyiv on Thursday, hours before the parliament vote.",
      "Here\u2019s a timeline of the deal\u2019s conception and signing:",
      "In response to rising pressure from Western allies and clear battlefield disadvantages, Zelenskyy outlines a so-called victory plan to end the war. The plan sought to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s negotiating hand and proposed measures to boost its military potential, but also economic partnerships with Western allies.",
      "Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals such as uranium, titanium, lithium, and graphite.",
      "Zelenskyy pitches the plan to the White House during a visit to Washington in late September, and later in a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower in New York.",
      "Giving American companies preferential access to Ukraine would serve as leverage against Russia as most mineral deposits are located very close to front-line areas. Having U.S. companies on the ground, the thinking goes, would cement Washington's interests in Ukraine and serve as a de facto security guarantee. Critical minerals used to manufacture weapons, aviation and batteries would also give the U.S. access to reserves in a global market dominated by China.",
      "Trump appears captivated by the idea and very soon after his inauguration in January starts touting the idea of getting Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elemnts.",
      "By February, the White House and Ukraine appear to have made significant progress toward reaching an agreement that would provide the U.S. with access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals.",
      "On Feb. 12, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arrives in Kyiv, becoming the first senior Trump administration official to visit and expecting Zelenskyy to sign the deal that day amid a push by Washington quickly end the war. But the Ukrainian president declines, saying elements of the draft didn't align with his country\u2019s constitution. The deal would have given the U.S. 50% rights to Ukraine\u2019s minerals and mentioned nothing of security guarantees.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign \u2026 because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press at the Munich Security Conference in February.",
      "Bessent later said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that Zelenskyy \u201cblew up\u201d the deal.",
      "Zelenskyy shot back, saying Bessent\u2019s approach had been disrespectful.",
      "\u201cMy colleagues know that if someone taps their finger on an agreement and says, \u2018You must sign now\u2019 \u2014 I could only say to him, \u2018Stop tapping your finger and let\u2019s have a proper conversation,'\u201d Zelenskyy later said in recounting the meeting in April to reporters in Kyiv.",
      "The two sides agreed to a new draft later in February.",
      "And on Feb. 28, Zelenskyy arrived in Washington with the intention of signing the revised version of the deal. But Zelenskyy insists on adding explicit U.S. security guarantees to the deal, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn\u2019t be trusted to comply with a ceasefire deal. A shouting match breaks out in the Oval Office, and Trump berates the Ukrainian president for not demonstrating gratitude for American support.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not in a good position. You don\u2019t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,\u201d Trump shouted.",
      "Zelenskyy leaves the White House with no deal and a deeply uncertain future with Washington. Shortly after, the U.S. pauses military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.",
      "According to multiple Ukrainian and Western officials, results from ceasefire talks between Ukrainian and U.S. delegates in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 marked a turning point after the disastrous Oval Office meeting.",
      "Ukraine agrees to a U.S. proposal for a full and immediate 30-day ceasefire, pending approval by the Kremlin, which had so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions. By piling conditions on both proposals for both full and partial ceasefires, Putin began testing Trump\u2019s patience.",
      "Meanwhile, technical discussions over the minerals deal resume. But the Trump administration introduces a new clause demanding that Ukraine reimburse the full amount of U.S. aid provided since the start of the full-scale invasion. Trump mentions a $500 billion figure as compensation, an amount many times more than the sum of aid provided.",
      "Ukrainian officials continue lobbying for a more equitable structure that respects Ukraine\u2019s strategic interests and state sovereignty. Zelenskyy spells out three core principles: The creation of a joint investment fund, 50-50 governance and the exclusion of debt repayment.",
      "Intensive negotiations continue, requiring Ukrainian and U.S. officials to work across time zones. Each day ushers in proposals and counterproposals.",
      "\u201cThere were likely hundreds of revisions and dozens of draft revisions,\u201d a senior European official close to the talks said. \u201cEvery morning meant a new batch of edits for each side.\u201d",
      "Svyrydenko said on April 18 that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent before a possible fuller agreement later. A draft, dated April 17 and obtained by The Associated Press, called for creating a joint U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, incorporated as a partnership in Delaware.",
      "The draft document was a version marked up by the United States and showed that the Trump administration could be willing to cede on some demands that Ukraine opposed.",
      "The draft was notable because it called for the U.S. to make a significant initial cash investment in the fund, in addition to receiving credit in the form of equity that is equivalent to the billions in U.S. military assistance already spent. Earlier versions had the U.S. investing no additional capital in Ukraine while having exclusive rights to the country\u2019s natural resources.",
      "Then, a breakthrough moment came on April 26 in the form of a tete-a-tete between Trump and Zelenskyy in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral. Zelenskyy described it as a turning point and \u201cthe best conversation\u201d the two leaders have had to date.",
      "The exchange paved the way for the signing of the minerals deal in Washington four days later, he said.",
      "In the end, Zelenskyy didn't get explicit security guarantees as part of the deal. Still, the final agreement was considered a victory for Ukraine after months of diplomatic work.",
      "The signed deal crucially doesn't call for Kyiv to reimburse the U.S. for the aid it has already received \u2014 a concession from Trump. That concession was",
      "That concession was extracted after Ukrainians argued that recognizing past aid as debt retrospectively would go against agreements that Ukraine has made to obtain that aid with the U.S., European Union, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka said. Instead, Ukrainians argued for future military assistance to count as part of investment into the fund.",
      "Bessent acknowledged that the agreement was a \u201ctacit security guarantee because of the economic partnership.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has agreed to cut tariffs on British autos, steel and aluminum in a planned trade deal",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump agreed Thursday to cut tariffs on U.K. autos, steel and aluminum in a planned trade deal but played down the possibility of other nations getting similarly favorable terms on his import taxes, which are roiling the global economy.",
      "Under the framework agreement, the United Kingdom is to buy more American beef and ethanol and streamline its customs process for goods from the United States. But Trump's baseline 10% tariffs against British goods are to stay in place, and the Republican president suggested that even higher import taxes would be charged on other countries trying to reach deals with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat's a low number,\u201d Trump said of the U.K.'s 10% tariff rate, adding that other countries would face higher tariff rates in their deals because the U.S. runs trade deficits with them and \u201cin many cases they didn't treat us right.\u201d",
      "The announcement provided a political victory for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and offered a degree of validation for Trump's claims that his turbulent approach on trade may be able to rebalance the global economy on his preferred terms. While the deal should improve Britain's situation relative to when Trump began imposing new tariffs, the world economy is still mired in the confusion and uncertainty unleashed by the president's import taxes. The deal with the U.K. would be a resonant but small step toward greater clarity given that Britain represents a fraction of U.S. imports.",
      "The U.S. president talked up the framework to reporters in the Oval Office, although the fine print remains in flux.",
      "\u201cIn the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have it all very conclusive,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., and streamline the processing of U.S. goods through customs. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the baseline 10% tariffs would stay in place and said an unspecified British company would be announcing the purchase of $10 billion in aircraft from Boeing.",
      "U.K. officials said Trump's auto tariffs would go from 27.5% to 10% on a quota of 100,000 vehicles and the import taxes on steel and aluminum would go from 25% to zero. Starmer said Britain would preserve its health and safety standards on food products.",
      "The U.K. government also said it would also reduce tariffs on 2,500 U.S. products such as olive oil, wine and sports equipment, bringing down the average tariff rate 1.8%.",
      "Starmer, speaking over the phone to Trump while reporters listened in, stressed the importance of the relationship between the two countries as the anniversary of the Allies' World War II victory in Europe was being commemorated.",
      "\u201cTo be able to announce this great deal, on the same day 80 years forward, almost at the same hour,\u201d Starmer said, \u201cI think is incredibly important and makes this truly historic.\u201d",
      "Starmer later spoke to workers at a Jaguar Land Rover plant and promoted the deal, which he said would protect thousands of auto jobs. He told the workers that \u201cthis is just the start,\u201d saying \u201cwe are hammering out further details to reduce barriers to trade with the United States and across the world.\u201d",
      "While celebrating the planned deal, Trump talked up the U.S. economy's future despite worrisome signs of a possible slowdown and increase in inflation that could hurt most Americans' financial well-being and lead to layoffs.",
      "The president said the public should buy into the stock market because the U.S. was about to go up like a \u201crocket ship,\" even as he dismissed reports of fewer container ships docking in the U.S. and companies warning of price increases if the tariffs remain.",
      "Trump said that fewer container ships arriving from China meant \u201cwe lose less money\u201d from the trade deficit, even though the goods in those ships are used by U.S. manufacturers and sold by retailers in ways that can support jobs while holding down prices.",
      "Asked about companies saying they would need to raise prices because of the tariffs, Trump said, \u201cI think they\u2019re saying that just to try and negotiate deals with me.\u201d Trump suggested that he might put 100% tariffs on Mattel toys if they don't relocate their factories to the United States.",
      "Trump has maintained that there is \u201cvirtually\u201d no inflation. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure has increased at 2.3% annually, slightly higher than the central bank's 2% target.",
      "The U.S. president on Thursday said that Fed Chair Jerome Powell should cut the Fed's benchmark interest rates that are designed to manage inflation, saying that Powell was holding the Fed's rates at current levels instead of slashing them because \u201che's not in love with me.\u201d Powell warned at a Wednesday news conference that the tariffs were creating uncertainty and the Fed could afford to wait until more data shows the impacts on the economy.",
      "The U.S. already runs a trade surplus with the U.K., making it a bit easier to find common ground at a time when Trump has staked his tariffs on eliminating the annual trade deficits with multiple nations he says have taken advantage of the U.S.",
      "A British government official, insisting on anonymity to discuss the talks, said the U.K. planned to seek greater trade liberalization as negotiations continue, such that the effective tariff rate charged by the U.S. could be lower than the 10% baseline.",
      "The official said the talks have been built on the longstanding closeness between the two nations and, when in discussions with the Trump administration, the key was to be charming and know how to say \u201cno\u201d nicely.",
      "The official said Trump had invited the British government to agree to a trade deal before April 2, but the president changed his mind so that he could impose his sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. That statement indicates that Trump could have announced some form of Thursday's agreement weeks earlier.",
      "No new deals have been reached with the United States' largest trading partners, including Canada, Mexico and China. Trump has left the highest tariffs in place on China, sparking a confrontation between the world's two biggest economies. Washington and Beijing are sending officials to Switzerland this weekend for an initial round of trade talks.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he \"could\" lower the 145% rate charged on Chinese goods if the weekend talks go well.",
      "\u201cRight now, you can\u2019t get any higher,\" Trump said. \"It's at 145, so we know it\u2019s coming down.\u201d",
      "The U.S. and the U.K. have been aiming to strike a bilateral trade agreement since the British people voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, allowing the country to negotiate independently of the rest of the continent. Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted a future deal with the U.S. as an incentive for Brexit.",
      "Negotiations started in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. But the talks made little progress under President Joe Biden, a Democrat and a critic of Brexit. Negotiations resumed after Trump returned to office in January and intensified in recent weeks.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is far more important for the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain\u2019s exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s top automaker Toyota reported record sales for the fiscal year through March on Thursday, but its profit for the latest quarter faltered partly because of a certification scandal.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s January-March net profit totaled 664.6 billion yen ($4.6 billion), down from 997.6 billion yen the same period a year ago. Quarterly sales totaled 12.36 trillion yen ($85.9 billion), up from 11 trillion yen.",
      "Toyota has been strengthening the testing system of its vehicles after acknowledging wide-ranging fraudulent testing, including the use of inadequate or outdated data in crash tests, incorrect testing of airbag inflation and engine power checks.",
      "Akio Toyoda, Toyota\u2019s chairman and the grandson of the automaker\u2019s founder, has apologized. The wrongdoing did not affect the safety of vehicles already on roads, which include the popular Corolla subcompact and Lexus luxury vehicles.",
      "But the scandal has been a major embarrassment for a manufacturer whose brand has been synonymous for decades with quality and attention to detail.",
      "For the fiscal year through March, Toyota reported a 4.77 trillion yen ($33 billion) profit, down from 4.94 trillion yen the previous fiscal year.",
      "Annual sales reached a record 48 trillion yen ($333.6 billion), up from 45 trillion yen. Toyota is forecasting sales of 48.5 trillion yen ($337 billion) for the fiscal year through March 2026.",
      "Its profit forecast was less bullish, citing costs to meet carbon neutrality demands, as well as the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s U.S. tariffs on operating income, which was factored in tentatively at 180 billion yen ($1.3 billion), according to Toyota. That estimate covers April and May, meaning it could grow in coming months.",
      "Consolidated vehicle sales for the fiscal year through March totaled 9.36 million vehicles, down slightly from 9.44 million vehicles the previous fiscal year.",
      "Cost reduction and marketing efforts worked as pluses countering the negatives, including the production shutdown spanning several months in the U.S. due to quality issues, Toyota officials said.",
      "Toyota also said the portion of electric vehicles it was selling was steadily growing. Sometimes Toyota has been criticized as falling behind in the global move toward EVs, partly because it has an extensive lineup of other kinds of green cars, including hybrids.",

      "The Bank of England is cutting its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration",
      "LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% amid concerns over the potential shock to global growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.",
      "The decision Thursday was widely expected, though there was an array of opinion on the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, with two voting for a bigger half-point cut to 4%, and two voting to hold rates.",
      "Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey said inflationary pressures have continued to ease, paving the way for the fourth quarter-point rate cut since August.",
      "\u201cThe past few weeks have shown how unpredictable the global economy can be,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s why we need to stick to a gradual and careful approach to further rate cuts. Ensuring low and stable inflation is our top priority.\u201d",
      "The decision is the first since President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April. Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to U.K. goods entering the U.S., the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.",
      "Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, could be lifted later Thursday when details of a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. are announced. At the very least, they are expected to lower the tariff burden.",
      "Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that a deal due to be announced at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) will be a \u201cfull and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.\u201d",
      "Though the tariff burden may be eased, the biggest uncertainty facing the global economy is the potential for a U.S.-China trade war, which would dampen economic growth everywhere.",
      "The rate cut comes despite expectations that inflation will rise further above the bank's 2% target over coming months, from the current 2.6% as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, and firms passing on tax rises to consumers.",
      "\u201cWhile headline inflation is expected to rise in the near-term, we do not expect that to persist,\u201d said Bailey, adding that it will be back around target in two years time.",
      "Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the U.S. Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump\u2019s tariffs affect the U.S. economy before making any moves.",
      "Most economists think the Bank of England will continue to lower borrowing rates over the coming months, though admitted that the three-way split in the voting may complicate its messaging.",
      "\u201cWe still think the Bank will cut rates at least twice more later this year, but much like the Fed\u2019s message yesterday, U.K. policy makers will want to see more data on how tariffs and domestic tax increases are being digested by the economy before moving decisively\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China is crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks",
      "SUQUAMISH, Wash. -- For over two decades, Suquamish tribal member Joshua George has dived into the emerald waters of the Salish Sea looking for an unusually phallic clam that\u2019s coveted thousands of miles away.",
      "George is a geoduck diver. Pronounced \u201cgooey-duck,\u201d the world\u2019s largest burrowing clam has been harvested in tidelands by George\u2019s Indigenous ancestors in the Pacific Northwest since before Europeans arrived.",
      "In recent years it has also become a delicacy in China, with Washington state sending 90% of its geoducks there, creating a niche yet lucrative American seafood export.",
      "But the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is now crippling an entire industry that hand-harvests geoducks, leaving Washington state divers without work, Seattle exporters without business and Chinese aficionados with fewer of these prized clams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in 24 years where I don\u2019t know when or if we\u2019ll be going back to work or if I have to find another job or what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d George said.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-driven economic feud with China, which dates back to his first term in office, swiftly resumed in February within weeks of taking back the White House. By April, Trump had placed tariffs of at least 145% on China, which led China to retaliate with tariffs of 125% on the U.S.",
      "Top U.S. officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since the latest tariffs were imposed, but it is unclear where those talks will lead.",
      "Enter the geoduck, weighing about 2 pounds and so entrenched in local culture that it is the mascot for Evergreen State College in Olympia. The meaty mollusk is best described as sweet and briny, and it's often sliced raw for crisp sashimi out west while China consumers prefer it chewy in stir-fries or hot pot soups. Pre-tariff costs were as high as $100 per pound in restaurants, so it\u2019s a dish generally reserved for special occasions like Chinese New Year, or to celebrate a business gathering.",
      "Unlike other products with long-lasting shelf life and standing inventory, the trade war has had an immediate, direct effect on the delicate geoducks, which are shipped alive the same day of harvest.",
      "\u201cThe whole market, everybody just had to stop,\u201d said Jim Boure, general manager of Suquamish Seafoods, an enterprise of the Suquamish Tribe. \u201cWe started getting phone calls from buyers saying orders are canceled.\u201d",
      "The millions of pounds of geoducks shipped annually to China come from two main sources: wild harvests on tracts of seafloor that are split between the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and Puget Sound Treaty Indian Tribes, and tideland farms. The state\u2019s share is auctioned to private exporters that often hire contract divers to harvest them.",
      "As of late April, Washington state divers had only pulled about half of the expected harvest from the state tracts, said Blain Reeves, an aquatic resources division manager for the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. Last year, the state and tribes collectively harvested about 3.4 million pounds of wild Washington geoduck for sale. The state generated $22.4 million in revenue for their half of the clams, which went toward paying for aquatic restoration projects locally. The state doesn't track how much is harvested by private farmers.",
      "\u201cIf only half the pounds that were contracted are harvested, then our revenue is halved,\u201d Reeves said.",
      "The Suquamish operation has no orders to harvest for at the moment, but it still must keep up with the maintenance to stay ready for business if and when China comes calling.",
      "On a recent April day, George\u2019s team made a quick trip to collect a handful of the clams for state lab testing.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re doing the job, and it\u2019s not all this other political stuff behind the scenes and everything else, we love this,\u201d said George, adding that diving, which takes place early in the day so that the geoducks are on an airplane by evening, has allowed him to watch his kids grow up.",
      "Fellow diver Kyle Purser said he cherishes his underwater job, but now fears it's being taken away.",
      "\"When you\u2019re watching your money disappear and you\u2019ve got families to feed and not knowing when you're going to get your next paycheck, (it's) very stressful,\u201d he said.",
      "The geoduck import market was already facing weaker demand in recent years due to the Chinese economy\u2019s struggle to regain post-pandemic momentum. While the tariffs have only exacerbated troubles for geoduck sellers in Washington, there's also been an unintended consequence: The American trade war has inadvertently boosted the Canadian geoduck business, which is facing a mere 25% tariff from China in comparison to the 125% for the U.S.",
      "Washington state in the U.S. and Canada's British Columbia province are the two primary places where the wild geoducks grow naturally for commercial harvest. The two countries did healthy business primarily serving Chinese appetites for decades, in part because quantities are limited. It\u2019s a labor-intensive and heavily-regulated harvest, as divers must go several feet below the surface to dig for them.",
      "\u201cThey love the fact that it tastes like the sea,\u201d said James Austin, president of Canada\u2019s Underwater Harvesters Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a product that\u2019s really a hit with the Chinese. It\u2019s all about the wild coastline. It\u2019s really prestigious.\u201d",
      "Austin said he expects there will be 2.75 million pounds of Canadian geoducks harvested in 2025, worth approximately $60 million Canadian dollars ($43.4 million USD) in revenue.",
      "While demand has been relatively low but still steady for Canadian's geoducks, Austin said they're now the leading exporters for China, which has helped them negotiate higher prices as a result. For example, after Canada got hit with a 25% tariff in March, export sale prices dropped to $12 per pound, and after the U.S. got hit with a 125% tariff in April, Canadian geoducks are now being sold for $17 a pound.",
      "\u201cWe have no competitors right now,\u201d Austin said.",
      "Yang Bin at Beihai Huaxiashougang Health Industry Company in Beihai city of Guangxi province in China said their seafood wholesale important business no longer gets geoduck from the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t care about U.S. tariffs because we can get geoduck from other countries with stable prices,\u201d Yang said.",
      "On their first week back to work since the tariff fight brought business to a standstill in Washington state, Derrick McRae and his brother pulled up about 800 pounds of wild geoducks in just one April day.",
      "He donned a full-body diving outfit with an oxygen line tethered to his boat to dive under the cold waters of an inland sea channel west of Seattle. Kneeled on the seafloor, McRae used a water spray gun to move the sand covering the geoducks. In the cloud of sediment, he felt for the neck with his hand, pulling the clam and stuffing it in a net attached to him.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of waiting on the edge of our seats to see what happens next,\u201d McRae said.",
      "At one of the southernmost inlets, farmer Ian Child said the tariff disruption is not just hurting his bottom line but the entire farming process. He usually places young geoducks in the sand in the summer, but he can\u2019t mix new crops with any existing unharvested clams.",
      "\u201cI think that the demand is still over there for the product,\u201d he said of China. \u201cI think they still want it. It\u2019s just a matter of where the tariffs will land.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- Angel Reese's rookie year surpassed nearly all expectations.",
      "The Chicago Sky All-Star set records before her season got cut short by an injury and helped the league soar to new heights in popularity after she and the Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark took their rivalry from the college ranks to the pros.",
      "One thing Reese didn't do was win. Not the way she is accustomed to winning. That's something she wants to change, starting with a marquee opener at Indiana on May 17.",
      "\u201cI wasn't used to that,\" Reese said. \"It just takes an adjustment. It's something that you don't want to get used to because you don't want to get in a mindset, like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just going to be losing every night.' We were right there every night.\u201d",
      "The Sky finished 10th in the WNBA with a 13-27 record last season and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2018. The disappointing results were despite getting significant contributions from Reese and fellow rookie Kamilla Cardoso. The two young stars are back, and the team made major roster changes to give them some help.",
      "Chicago fired former coach Teresa Weatherspoon after one year and hired Las Vegas assistant Tyler Marsh to replace the Naismith Hall of Famer.",
      "The Sky also brought in veteran leadership, including franchise career assist leader Courtney Vandersloot and acquiring two-time All-Star Ariel Atkins from Washington. Chicago hopes the additions will help Reese and Cardoso take their games to another level.",
      "\u201cShe wants to compete, she wants to win, she\u2019s somebody that puts that above everything else,\" general manager Jeff Pagliocca said of Reese. \"With all the time that she puts into building her brand and flying all over the world, she still has proven to us time and time again she puts basketball first.",
      "\"Only a competitive player is going to have all these things in her life that are so special but still want to be the greatest player she can be.\u201d",
      "Reese and Clark helped change the landscape of the WNBA, drawing sellout crowds and record ratings while spurring debates about the sport and society. The rivals from LSU and Iowa showcased a style and swagger that captivated the nation when they were going at it in college.",
      "Reese, who finished second to Clark in the Rookie of the Year voting, averaged 13.6 points and a league-record 13.1 rebounds. She set a WNBA record with double-doubles in 15 straight games and finished with 26 on the season \u2014 the most ever by a rookie.",
      "Reese briefly held the mark for total rebounds with 446, only to miss the final six games with a wrist injury. While she was out, league MVP A\u2019ja Wilson finished with 451.",
      "But while the records piled up, so did the losses.",
      "In two seasons at Maryland and two more at LSU, Reese's teams lost a total of 20 games and never dropped more than two in a row. She won an NCAA championship with the Tigers in 2023, beating Clark and Iowa in the final.",
      "The Sky, meanwhile, lost 12 of their final 14 games last season. They dropped seven in a row before beating the Los Angeles Sparks on Sept. 6, only to have Reese suffer a hairline fracture in her left wrist that required surgery. With their star sidelined, they won their next game and lost the final five.",
      "\u201cObviously, that left a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d she said.",
      "Reese had a busy offseason, playing in the Unrivaled 3-on-3 league and trying to increase her range and develop into the sort of stretch power forward the Sky envision her becoming. She shot 39% last season and made just 3 of 16 3-pointers.",
      "\u201cWe want her to be dynamic,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWe want her to be able to score inside. We want to be able to create space for her to have more one-on-one finishes inside and to not have to have to feel like she's got to play in a crowd. We want to put the ball in her hands on the perimeter and allow her to facilitate and create off the dribble as well.\u201d",
      "Reese said the issue was more her hesitancy to take the shots than her ability to hit shots from the perimeter.",
      "\u201cI always just tell myself if I work out and make the shots I might as well take them in the game,\u201d she said.",
      "Reese got a taste of the championship atmosphere when she sat courtside during the WNBA finals between New York and Minnesota. She showed up for Game 5 wearing what looked like a custom outfit split down the middle with a Liberty jersey on her left side and Lynx jersey on the right.",
      "Reese also excelled in Unrivaled. Her team Rose BC won the championship, though she missed the playoffs after hurting her surgically repaired wrist. She likes the makeup of the Sky and believes Chicago will be difficult to beat.",
      "\u201cI think we have the right pieces this year,\u201d Reese said. \u201cWe have the great veteran leadership. We have coaches that just built a culture from the beginning and built the standards, so I\u2019m excited.\u201d",

      "The 10-team competition still has 12 games to be played in the group stage before the knockout rounds. The final had been scheduled for May 25 in Kolkata.",
      "The BCCI said the decision to suspend the tournament was made \"in the collective interest of all stakeholders.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the Nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country,\u201d the BCCI statement said.",
      "The suspension comes after the match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala in northern India was abandoned on Thursday evening when the power went out during a government mandated blackout. Punjab's next game against Mumbai Indians had already been moved from Dharamsala to Mumbai because of the closure of several airports in the Indian northwestern corridor.",
      "Pakistan earlier said it was moving its own domestic T20 tournament to the United Arab Emirates because of the tensions. The PCB confirmed the relocation of the Pakistan Super League to Dubai in a statement released early Friday, citing growing concerns among overseas players and the need to prioritize their safety.",
      "On Thursday, authorities said an Indian drone fell inside the complex of the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium hours before the start of PSL game in which several foreign cricketers from New Zealand, Australia, West Indies, South Africa and England were due to compete.",

      "While no current NFL player tops 400 pounds \u2014 Baltimore Ravens guard Daniel Faalele is the heaviest at 380 \u2014 there have been a few who have played at or near four bills. Here\u2019s a look at some of the beefiest guys in league history:",
      "A first-round draft pick by Detroit in 1999, Gibson started 15 games for the Lions before getting waived in the middle of his third season. Shoulder issues landed the offensive tackle on injured reserve in each of his first two years. He also played with Dallas and Chicago before getting one final shot in the NFL with Buffalo in 2006; the Bills cut him near the end of training camp. He bounced around the Arena Football League from there. He battled depression after his playing days ended and weighed as much as 480 pounds.",
      "The 6-foot-10 Brown signed with the St. Louis Rams as an undrafted rookie from Mississippi in 2013. He showed up 15 pounds heavier than then-Rams coach Jeff Fisher expected. He shed some weight during training camp \u2014 the Rams had him playing right tackle after working him on both sides of the ball \u2014 but he didn\u2019t make the team.",
      "Cut by Washington before spending two years (1984-85) in the USFL, Newton\u2019s career changed dramatically when he signed with the Dallas Cowboys. Nicknamed \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d because of his size, Newton lost a footrace with then-Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson that pushed him to get into better shape. He ended up becoming one of the league\u2019s most dominant guards in the 1990s. He made six Pro Bowls while blocking for Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman and helped the Cowboys win three Super Bowls. Newton was back over 400 pounds in retirement, but he eventually lost nearly half his body weight thanks to stomach surgery in 2010.",
      "Despite weighing as much as 450 pounds as a two-way player at Bethel University of the NAIA, Buffalo drafted Jasper in the seventh round in 2011. He dropped to 375 pounds during training camp but was released in final cuts. He landed on Buffalo\u2019s practice squad but never played in a regular-season game. He\u2019s now the head coach at Stetson.",
      "McKinnie played in 179 games, with 162 starts, over a 12-year NFL career. A college standout at Miami and the seventh overall pick by Minnesota in 2002, McKinnie\u2019s 6-foot-8 frame handled the weight well. He made the Pro Bowl in 2009 and won the Super Bowl with Baltimore following the 2012 season.",
      "A first-round draft pick by Chicago in 1985, Perry quickly earned the nickname \u201cThe Refrigerator\u201d and became a fan favorite as a rookie. The run-stuffing nose tackle also carried five times for 7 yards and two touchdowns in the regular season and had a TD catch. His bone-jarring TD run \u2014 and subsequent spike \u2014 against New England in the 1986 Super Bowl remains an iconic moment in NFL lore. He finished his pro career with 524 tackles, including 29 1/2 sacks, over 138 games. The Fridge may have gained popularity in retirement: He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame and participated as a celebrity contestant in the 2003 Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest.",

      "Vasily Podkolzin, Jake Walman, Darnell Nurse and Evander Kane also scored for the Oilers, and Arvidsson and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins each had two assists. Calvin Pickard, who appeared to be shaken up when Vegas\u2019 Tomas Hertl fell on his left leg in the third period, made 28 saves.",
      "Victor Olofsson scored two power-play goals and had an assist for the Golden Knights, Alex Pietrangelo had a goal and an assist, and William Karlsson also scored. Jack Eichel had three assists, and Mark Stone two assists to extend their points streaks to five games apiece. Adin Hill stopped 33 shots.",
      "Game 3 is Saturday night in Edmonton.",
      "Kane\u2019s goal 1:52 into the third period made it 4-2 before Olofsson answered less than three minutes later off a cross-ice pass from Eichel. Pietrangelo, who missed Game 1 because of an illness, tied it with 8:02 left with a shot from the right point.",
      "The Golden Knights scored the only goal in the first period on Olofsson's power-play shot from the right circle. Eichel set up the play by passing to Stone, who from below the goal found an open Olofsson for his first career playoff goal.",
      "Edmonton rolled off three goals in a row in the second period \u2014 all from distance. The Golden Knights quickly responded with Karlsson's redirect of Eichel's shot with 1:50 left in the period cut it to to 3-2.",
      "The Oilers, who trailed 1-0 after one period, have a record six consecutive comeback victories in a single postseason.",
      "Vegas has never been swept in its eight-year history and even rallied from 2-0 down in 2021 to beat Colorado in six games, though that series began on the road. The Golden Knights also have been eliminated in five games just twice, including the 2018 Stanley Cup Final against Washington.",
      "The Golden Knights\u2019 42-game playoff winning streak when scoring at least three goals ended. It was the second longest in NHL history to Montreal\u2019s 52-game streak in 1945-57, according to Sportradar.",

      "Stephen Curry sat down after the Golden State Warriors went through their gameday shootaround practice in Minneapolis and quickly announced that he\u2019s feeling great",
      "Stephen Curry sat down after the Golden State Warriors went through their shootaround practice in Minneapolis on Thursday, quickly announcing that he's feeling great.",
      "He was not telling the truth.",
      "\u201cSarcasm,\u201d the four-time NBA champion with the Warriors quickly clarified, just in case anyone missed the joke.",
      "Curry is going to be a postseason spectator for at least a few games, his Grade 1 hamstring strain bad enough that it forced him out in the second quarter of Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinal series at Minnesota on Tuesday night. He missed the lopsided Game 2 loss to the Timberwolves on Thursday night that evened the series and will likely be sidelined for at least Games 3 and 4 in San Francisco, too.",
      "Curry \u2014 who is with the team but isn't allowed to do anything basketball-related yet, even stationary shooting \u2014 isn't exactly sure how or why the injury happened. He's never had any hamstring issue of significance before.",
      "\u201cIt's hard to really predict this stuff is what I'm learning,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThere were no, like, warning signs or any weird feelings. I felt great the whole game up until that point. And then I made a little pivot move on defense and felt something.\u201d",
      "Curry thought he would be able to return to Game 1, then quickly realized that wasn't the case. Playing with the strain could have made the issue far worse, Curry said. Hamstrings, he's quickly learning, need time no matter what sort of rehabilitation program he partakes in.",
      "\u201cObviously, a tough break,\u201d Curry said. \u201cHopefully, I'll be back soon.\u201d",
      "Curry scored 13 points in 13 minutes of Game 1 before his exit, and Golden State went on to a 99-88 win. Buddy Hield, Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green combined for 62 points for the Warriors, who held Minnesota to a 5-for-29 clunker on 3-point tries and limited the Timberwolves to 60 points through three quarters.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of confidence that we can still win the series and guys will step up no matter how it looks,\" Curry said. \"And it\u2019s obviously a situation where you want to think positively and optimistically that we can win games and buy me some time to get back and hopefully have another series after this and be able to be in a position where I can get back out there safely, where I\u2019m not putting too much risk on the body if it\u2019s not ready.\u201d",
      "Curry, who is averaging a team-best 22 points in these playoffs, can still contribute in small ways even if he's not playing.",
      "\u201cThe guys obviously revere Steph, and they love his presence and that'll matter to us tonight during the game,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said in his pregame interview. \u201cI'm sure he'll be talking to the guys on the sidelines and giving some thoughts. He may come into our huddle and make a suggestion, which I always welcome, so it's good to have him here for sure.\u201d",
      "At one point, when Green picked up his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, two short of an automatic one-game suspension, Curry was concerned enough about his pal getting ejected for a second technical that he went over to the scorer's table to try to talk Green down and walk him back to the bench.",
      "But not having Curry on the court clearly hurt.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s difficult to recreate or even get close to doing what he does, but we\u2019re going to have to find a way,\u201d Butler said. \"So we\u2019ll go to the tapes, talk about it and execute it to the best of our abilities.\u201d",

      "The Toronto Maple Leafs will seek a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers on Friday night, while Rantanen \u2014 on a scoring roll the likes of which hockey hasn't seen in generations \u2014 will lead the Dallas Stars into Game 2 of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Winnipeg Jets.",
      "Florida lost a pair of one-goal games at Toronto to open their series, which resumes on the Panthers' home ice for Game 3 on Friday.",
      "History says the Panthers are in big trouble: Toronto has won all 11 of its previous best-of-seven series when taking a 2-0 lead at home, Florida is 0-5 all-time in series where it dropped both Games 1 and 2, and leaguewide, teams facing 0-2 deficits come back to win those series only about 14% of the time.",
      "There are no magic words to say now, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Thursday.",
      "\u201cIf there was, you would have said it two games ago, right? We\u2019re not holding back any gems,\" Maurice said. \"That's probably the most important thing that you realize. We went on the road and lost two one-goal games. Our game\u2019s not perfect. Neither is theirs. So, you\u2019re looking for an adjustment to foundation more than an adjustment to something unusual.\u201d",
      "Over in the West, where Dallas stuck first in Winnipeg with a 3-2 win, Rantanen is indeed doing something unusual \u2014 lots of things that are unusual, actually.",
      "He's the third player in NHL playoff history to have a hat trick in back-to-back games: Jari Kurri for Edmonton in 1985 and Doug Bentley for Chicago in 1944 are the others. He's had a hand in each of Dallas' last 12 goals, a streak unmatched by any player on any team in playoff history. He's the first player in playoff history with at least eight goals and six assists in a four-game span. The first player with two three-goal periods in the same postseason. And on, and on, and on.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see how long he can run this for,\" Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. \"He\u2019s rolling. He's feeling it. Pretty impressive, what he\u2019s doing. I mean, considering the opponent and the time of year and how he\u2019s dominating games, really impressive.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 3, Friday, 7 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max)",
      "Series: Maple Leafs lead 2-0",
      "If losing a pair of one-goal playoff games wasn't bad enough \u2014 5-4 in Game 1, 4-3 in Game 2 \u2014 the Panthers can look at two goals given up in those games and really lament how those scores factored into creating their current situation.",
      "In Game 1, Seth Jones scored to get Florida within 2-1 \u2014 and the Panthers gave up a goal to Morgan Rielly 19 seconds later. In Game 2, Anton Lundell scored early in the third to pull Florida into a 3-3 tie \u2014 only to have Mitch Marner score what became the game-winner 17 seconds later.",
      "The Leafs held serve at home, which is what they were supposed to do. Toronto became the first team to get to six wins in these playoffs and will be feeling very good about its game going into Game 3.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how we go about our day today,\" Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said Thursday before Florida hopped aboard its charter flight back home. \"It\u2019s about recovering and putting the best foot forward to play our best game tomorrow night and get back in this thing.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Friday, 9:30 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max)",
      "Series: Stars lead 1-0",
      "Playoff hockey is different. Every opponent at this time of year is obviously proven. But the Winnipeg Jets \u2014 who needed seven games and a Game 7 miracle to escape St. Louis in Round 1 \u2014 are right back into some hot water, in large part because they're giving up a lot of goals.",
      "The Jets have given up 26 goals in the last six games, after not giving up more than 20 in any six-game span of the regular season.",
      "Rantanen's hot streak is one thing, but Winnipeg's defense wasn't exactly airtight going back to Round 1 either. And while the Jets survived a Game 7 at home to get here, the last thing they need is to go back to Dallas in a 2-0 hole.",
      "That starts with doing more against Rantanen.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just somebody that you always have to know when he\u2019s on the ice,\" Jets coach Scott Arniel said of facing Rantanen. \u201cWhenever you face elite players, you\u2019ve got to know where they are.

      "For Mike Sullivan, the latest coach of the New York Rangers, there will be many priorities in taking over a team that missed the playoffs a season after winning the Presidents\u2019 Trophy.",
      "Foremost will be communication.",
      "\u201cI have spoken to every player on the roster over the last three days,\u2019\u2019 Sullivan said Thursday at his introductory press conference. \u201cI think there is a fair amount of leadership in that room. There\u2019s a lot of character in that room.\u201d",
      "Sullivan, the 38th coach in franchise history and fifth since 2018, agreed to lead the Rangers on May 2 after parting ways with Pittsburgh, where he won the Stanley Cup twice.",
      "He replaces Peter Laviolette, who was fired April 19 after the Rangers slid 29 points to miss the postseason despite their raft of talent. It will be up to Sullivan to resuscitate a power play that fell from the league\u2019s top echelon to 28th overall in 2024-25 and help the defense improve in front of elite goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who is coming off his worst NHL season.",
      "Sullivan spent four seasons as a Rangers assistant under then-coach John Tortorella from 2009-13. He also coached current Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury during that time. They also worked together through USA Hockey at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February and will be part of the U.S. contingent for the 2026 Milan Olympics.",
      "Sullivan will have top scorers Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad and Adam Fox on his side after years guiding Penguins stars Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang in Pittsburgh, where he won the Cup in 2016 and 2017.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve grown so much respect over the years for the talent that the Rangers have,\u2019\u2019 said Sullivan, who lost a seven-game first-round playoff series to the Rangers in 2022. \"I look forward to the opportunity to get to know these guys on a more personal level. I look forward to the opportunity to work with them, both on the ice and off the ice, to try to become the most competitive team that we can become.\u201d",
      "Also pressing for the 57-year-old Sullivan \u2014 who was drafted by the Rangers in 1987 and later played 709 NHL games for four other franchises \u2014 is how he will handle younger Rangers such as 22-year-old Brennan Othmann and 20-year-old Gabe Perreault, a first-round pick in 2023 who joined the team briefly at the end of last season.",
      "\u201cPart of coaching or the art of coaching, I guess, is trying to figure out what that daily recipe is that\u2019s best for the player,\u2019\u2019 Sullivan said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s time in the American League as a young player, sometimes it\u2019s time in the National League depending on the types of minutes that that player can play. What I will tell you is that I think it\u2019s important that every player earns their opportunities, that no one\u2019s entitled to an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Sullivan was joined Thursday by Drury, who was awarded a contract extension last month.",
      "Drury\u2019s previous two coaching hires \u2014 Laviolette and Gerard Gallant \u2014 each lasted two seasons. The 48-year-old executive expressed enthusiasm for the addition of Sullivan, the only U.S.-born coach with multiple Stanley Cup wins.",
      "\u201cThe second Mike was available, we quickly and aggressively pursued him,\u2019\u2019 Drury said. \u201cWe are certainly thrilled that pursuit led us to this moment today. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the women's national team.",
      "The five-time Olympic champion was named to the newly created position Thursday and it marks a major change in the way the organization creates its roster and coaching staff.",
      "\u201cI played for USA Basketball for so long and always really enjoyed my time with them,\" Bird said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI love representing my country. I love being competitive on that stage. To have that opportunity to do it in a different role is exciting.\u201d",
      "Before the change, a committee made those decisions, but now in a move similar to what the USA men's national team does, Bird will be the one responsible for putting things together. Grant Hill has the same role on the men's side.",
      "\u201cWe are really, really excited about Sue for so many reasons,\u201d USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said in a phone interview. \u201cHer pedigree and standing in the sport is so strong. Not just in women\u2019s basketball, but all of sport. She\u2019s a tremendous leader and we're very excited that she took this on for us.\u201d",
      "The men's team has had a managing director for two decades with Jerry Colangelo serving in that spot from 2005-21 before Hill took over.",
      "\u201cShe's had five Olympic gold medals herself and understands what's involved,\u201d Tooley said. \u201cHaving the managing director position makes it easier to work with the staff for long term vision of the program. It's hard to do that with a committee that comes and goes and gets together a handful of times.\u201d",
      "Tooley said Bird's term will be for four years \u2014 the same as the Olympic cycle \u2014 and the change to this structure has been in the works for a few years, well before the decision to not select Caitlin Clark for the 2024 Paris Games team that left some people upset.",
      "\u201cDiscussions happened after the \u201821 Olympics and Sue served on the board last quad,\u201d Tooley said. \u201cWe got in discussions about the managing director role and we sat with her awhile and she gave it a lot of consideration and thought. It\u2019s an enormous responsibility.\u201d",
      "Bird said she's used to the pressure of USA Basketball where it's basically win a gold medal or bust. The Americans have won eight straight, including one at last year's Paris Olympics.",
      "\u201cThis is a different type of pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm hoping to bring all that I learned as a player, all my experience, all my understanding. The whole goal is to win a gold medal and it feels at times that's the only option. ... I know what it's like to be a player, know what it's like as a player to build teams and have teams come together and see what clicks.\u201d",
      "Before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Americans will play in the FIBA World Cup in Germany next year. The first qualifying event will take place in November. Besides figuring out what players will be on that team, Bird will have to decide who will be coaching the squad. There is no clear-cut choice right now.",
      "\u201cOf course I\u2019ve started to think about it, jotting some names down here and there,\u201d Bird said. \u201cIt's the first priority without a doubt. There are so many qualified coaches in college and the WNBA.\u201d",

      "\u201cI would be able to do it on my own,\" Vagnozzi said. \"But with players of this level it\u2019s important to have another viewpoint. And it\u2019s important to sometimes split up the weeks you spend with the player. Otherwise it\u2019s a 365-day/year job and that\u2019s a bit much.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019m hoping that Darren stays on for another five years, because we have such a great relationship. He might be the best coach ever in terms of results and other factors.\u201d",
      "Vagnozzi referred to how Sinner is the fourth player the Australian has coached to No. 1 after Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt and Simona Halep. \u201cBut most of all, he\u2019s a special person.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s a Champions League final few could have predicted.",
      "No Real Madrid. No team from the mega-rich Premier League. No rejuvenated Barcelona. And no Harry Kane-inspired Bayern Munich.",
      "Instead, it will be Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan facing off to be a somewhat unlikely winner of the biggest prize in club soccer.",
      "Neither club was among the favorites when the new-look, 36-team league phase of the competition rolled out in September.",
      "Indeed, PSG \u2014 without Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and at the start of the post-galacticos era \u2014 guaranteed its place in the knockout stage only by winning its final game of the league phase.",
      "Months later, however, PSG has been widely admired as perhaps the most stylish team in the competition after ending the title hopes of a succession of English opponents in its latest bid for its first European title.",
      "Meanwhile, three-time champion Inter, another team lacking superstars but well-coached and with a never-say-die spirit, has gone under the radar once again like it did when reaching the final in 2023 and losing to Manchester City.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at the details of the final, the teams and their route to the title match:",
      "Munich's Allianz Arena will host the final on May 31. It's the fifth time the German city has staged the European Cup's title match.",
      "The first three \u2014 1979, 1993, 1997 \u2014 were at Munich's previous home, Olympiastadion. The Allianz Arena was the host for Chelsea beating Bayern in a penalty shootout in 2012.",
      "American rock band Linkin Park will play the pre-match show.",
      "Real Madrid earned almost 139 million euros ($154 million) from its title-winning campaign in the Champions League last season and this season's winner should get more.",
      "Last year's prize fund of more than 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) rose by 25% this season in the expanded format featuring more teams (36, up from 32) and more games (eight instead of six in the first stage).",
      "So expect PSG or Inter earn at least 150 million euros ($170 million) if the team winds up as champion.",
      "These coffers can be further boosted across June and July, when both teams will be in the United States for the expanded 32-team Club World Cup. Winning that competition could net PSG or Inter more than $100 million from the $1 billion prize money fund.",
      "The finalists have never met in the Champions League.",
      "That's a refreshing rarity for two big clubs who regularly compete in Europe.",
      "PSG became the third French team to reach the European Cup final on two occasions, after Reims (1956 and \u201859) and Marseille (1991 and \u201993). PSG's other time was in 2020, when losing to Bayern Munich 1-0 in Lisbon.",
      "PSG's road to Munich has gone mostly through England. After seeing off fellow French club Brest in the playoffs, PSG has beaten Liverpool, Aston Villa and lastly Arsenal in successive rounds in the knockout stage \u2014 having also defeated then-Premier League champion Manchester City in a key victory in the next-to-last round of the league stage. Qualification was in the balance at that stage, with PSG having won just one of its first five league games only to win its last three.",
      "Inter was a two-time European champion before PSG was even founded in 1970, after titles in 1964 and 1965, while the Italian team added a third European crown in 2010.",
      "Unlike PSG, Inter qualified directly to the last 16 after finishing in fourth place, conceding just one goal in its eight league games. In the knockout stage, Simone Inzaghi's team overcame Feyenoord in the round of 16, Bayern in the quarterfinals and Lamine Yamal and Barcelona in a pair of epic legs in the semifinals.",
      "PSG's relatively brief history was underwhelming until the club was bought in 2011 by Qatar Sports Investments.",
      "Then came the soccer boom in the capital and the arrival of trophy after trophy \u2014 well, at domestic level anyway. PSG has won 11 of the last 13 Ligue 1 titles but now the hardware the Qatari owners want is the Champions League.",
      "There will be extra satisfaction if it happens after a change in approach that has seen the club shed the superstars \u2014 Lionel Messi, Neymar and Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 and rely on mostly young and hungry replacements, such as midfielder Jo\u00e3o Neves and forward D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9.",
      "It has been a more financially turbulent story at Inter, which has been owned by U.S. investment fund Oaktree since May last year after the eight-year tenure of Chinese retail giant Suning came to an end amid mounting debts.",
      "For three years before that, Inter was owned by a consortium led by Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir, which bought out Massimo Moratti.",
      "PSG has already clinched another French league this season, while Inter is still in a fight with Napoli to retain the Serie A title.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Golden State Warriors are planning to play without Stephen Curry for at least the next three games of their second-round series against Minnesota, after an MRI exam on Wednesday confirmed a mild strain of the star guard\u2019s left hamstring.",
      "The Warriors said Curry would be sidelined at least a week after the injury Tuesday night forced him out early in second quarter of Game 1, which they went on to win 99-88. He had 13 points in 13 minutes to help Golden State build a comfortable lead and take home-court advantage away from the Timberwolves.",
      "Game 2 is in Minneapolis on Thursday, before the series moves west to San Francisco for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday. The earliest return for Curry appears to be Game 5 on May 14, which is conveniently followed by three straight off days before Game 6 on May 18.",
      "Curry missed multiple games because of injuries during the 2016 and 2018 playoffs, absences the Warriors endured on their way to the NBA Finals. They lost to Cleveland in seven games for the 2016 championship, and they swept the Cavaliers in 2018 for a third title in four years.",
      "This Golden State roster hardly stacks up to those predecessors, however, when Curry and Draymond Green were much younger and other standouts like Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala were integral to their success. In 2018, they had Kevin Durant, too.",
      "For now, the Warriors were feeling good about the all-hands-on-deck effort led by Jimmy Butler, Buddy Hield and Green in Game 1, in which coach Steve Kerr played 12 different players.",

      "Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps \u201cclearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms,\u201d said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",
      "The new work showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms, with western chimps preferring a more even beat while eastern chimps used varied short and long intervals between beats. The research was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "It's well-known that chimps use tools such as rocks to crack open nuts and sticks to \u201cfish\u201d termites from their mounds. Tree roots can also be tools, the researchers say.",

While space debris trackers around the world converged in their forecasts, it was still too soon to know exactly when and where the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 would come down. That uncertainty was due to potential solar activity and the spacecraft\u2019s old condition. Its parachutes were expected to be useless by now and its batteries long dead.",

Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.",
      "\u201cI believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,\u201d Altman said in his opening remarks about AI\u2019s potential to transform society. \u201cFor that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.\u201d Altman urged senators to help usher in the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d of artificial intelligence and energy production that \u201cwill change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.\u201d",

Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?\u201d",
      "Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.",
      "Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.",
      "And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as \u201ca self sabotaging attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?\u201d asked Duckworth.",
      "But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.",
      "\u201cLook, there is a race, but we need to understand what we\u2019re racing for,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We\u2019re trying to win a race so that American values prevail.\u201d",

But she added, if not able to \u201chave our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.\u201d Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.",
      "Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.",
      "\u201cThe leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it\u2019s no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.\u201d",
      "Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.",
      "The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.",
      "Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China\u2019s \u201csophisticated smuggling operations\u201d to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.",
      "The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden\u2019s \u201coverly complex, overly bureaucratic\u201d rule with a simpler one but didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.",
      "Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been \u201cunbelievable\" in incentivizing major AI projects. \u201cI think that would be a good thing for other states to study,\u201d Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the \u201clargest AI training facility in the world.\u201d",
      "But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations,\u201d said Altman. \u201cOne federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine.\u201d",
      "While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate.",
      "A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation\u2019s electricity.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs.",
      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",
      "It's a bit counterintuitive that the oblong side of an egg could hold up better against a tumble, said study co-author Tal Cohen with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company\u2019s digital ad network",
      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company's digital ad network. The proposed remedy joins a separate federal effort to separate the Chrome browser from its dominant search engine.",
      "The government's latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that parts of its lucrative digital ad network have been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers.",
      "In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue.",
      "Not surprisingly, it's an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case \u2014known as remedy hearings \u2014 begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkema's ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but can't do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year.",
      "Google said in its own filing Monday that divestiture of AdX and DFP wouldn\u2019t be technically feasible because neither piece of technology is capable of working outside of Google's proprietary infrastructure. The company proposed its own remedies to restore competition, and reiterated its intent to appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cDivestiture is not as simple as selling either the AdX or DFP source code to a willing buyer,\u201d Google wrote.",
      "The attempt to tear down Google's ad network comes on top of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August.",
      "The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day.",
      "If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago.",
      "Google's Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the world's smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judge's order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue.",
      "But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.",
      "Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online \u2014 a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion.",

      "On Monday, the government launched a state-operated mobile app, marking one of Europe\u2019s most assertive steps toward digital age verification.",

      "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
      "A teenager who admitted being \u201caddicted to speed\u201d behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op.",
      "After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit.",
      "Virginia this year became the first state to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors' signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths.",
      "\u201cIt's a horror no one should have to experience,\u201d said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims' advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago.",
      "Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.",
      "Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudson's home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd \u201cBuster\u201d Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudson's two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital.",
      "\u201cYou always hear of these horrific accidents, and it\u2019s always far away, you don\u2019t know anybody. But all of a sudden, that\u2019s my daughter,\" Smith said. \u201cThis guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile.\u201d",
      "Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses.",
      "Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway.",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission.",
      "\u201cI guess I don\u2019t understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they can\u2019t. It's going to stop them in their tracks.\u201d",
      "The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda.",
      "Because Jones, 19, didn't receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldn't have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judge's requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said.",
      "Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance.",
      "Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nation's capital have been trying it out for years.",
      "But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly.",
      "\u201cWe've got a lot more satellites in the sky now,\u201d said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies.",
      "When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed.",
      "A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion.",
      "Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nannini's car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit.",
      "\u201cThat was my first question: Is it safe?\u201d Hope said.",
      "Not only did he come away convinced it was safe, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers.",

A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.",
      "By then, the road's speed limit had been lowered.",
      "\u201cThat boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not,\u201d she said. \"When you are going a few miles slower, there's more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, it's much less likely to be deadly.\u201d",

      "Fans of the game reacted to the delay with disappointment but also a shrug -- since it has been suggested the game would be released in 2024 and then this year.",
      "On a Reddit discussion forum dedicated to the game, several fans noted they had seen this before and wouldn't be surprised if the release was delayed again. Others took a more optimistic tone, saying an exact release date means it will actually happen this time around.",
      "One of the last times the game garnered this much buzz was in 2023, when a trailer for the game was leaked online. At the time, Rockstar released the first look of the sixth game 15 hours earlier than planned, citing the leak.",
      "That 90-second trailer gave fans a taste of what comes next for the game. The trailer suggested the next installment would be set in the Miami-inspired Vice City and star a female protagonist, a first for the franchise, named Lucia.",
      "It is unclear whether the delay means any, or all, of these details will remain part of Grand Theft Auto VI.",

      "Air traffic controllers could be heard telling a FedEx plane that their screens went dark and then asking the aircraft to tell their company to put pressure on to get the problem fixed.",

    "story": [
      "Two men have been convicted of cutting down the beloved Sycamore Gap tree in northern England along ancient Hadrian\u2019s Wall",
      "LONDON -- In late September 2023, as the first big storm of the fall was kicking up in the U.K., a malicious plan was hatched to take down one of England\u2019s favorite trees.",
      "Daniel Graham sent a message to his buddy, Adam Carruthers, telling him to \u201cget the saws warmed up,\u201d suggesting they might get some work clearing fallen trees.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t high winds that brought down the famous Sycamore Gap tree that night, jurors determined Friday. It was Graham and Carruthers \u2014 not cleaning up damage from the storm, but creating a mess of their own.",
      "The pair were convicted of two counts each of criminal damage by a jury in Newcastle Crown Court after little more than five hours of deliberations over two days.",
      "Even without the smoking chainsaw, prosecutors were able to prove the case through a trove of digital evidence that either put the men near the tree at the time it was felled or showed them excitedly discussing it the next day as the story of the tree\u2019s demise went viral.",
      "The prime piece of evidence was a grainy video on Graham\u2019s phone of the crime being committed on the dark and stormy night.",
      "Footage of the tree's last stand showed a solitary figure silhouetted beneath the towering canopy in a struggle with the trunk as the unmistakable sound of the chainsaw whined above the wind. With a single crack, the buzz of the saw died down, the person stepped back and the tree that had stood about 150 years crashed to earth.",
      "Metadata pinpointed the location of the video at the tree\u2019s location in Northumberland National Park. Other data showed Graham\u2019s Range Rover had traveled there.",
      "The Sycamore Gap tree was not Britain\u2019s biggest or oldest sycamore, but it was prized for its picturesque setting, symmetrically planted between two hills along the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire, and had attracted generations of followers.",
      "The tree had long been known to locals but received international attention in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.\u201d It drew tourists, lovers, landscape photographers and even those who spread the ashes of loved ones.",
      "\u201cFor over a century, Sycamore Gap has been an iconic natural landmark in the northeast of England, bringing immeasurable joy to those visiting the area,\" Gale Gilchrist, chief prosecutor for the region, said in a statement after the verdict. \u201cIn just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction.\u201d",
      "Neither Graham, who had a small construction business, nor Carruthers, a mechanic who sometimes worked with him, showed any visible reaction as the verdicts were read.",
      "Justice Christina Lambert ordered both men held in custody until sentencing on July 15 and said they could face \u201ca lengthy period in custody.\u201d The maximum sentence for criminal damage is 10 years in prison.",
      "The defendants, once close friends, both testified that they were at their respective homes that night and had nothing to do with the crime.",
      "Graham pointed the finger at Carruthers, saying he was obsessed with the tree. Graham said his friend and another man had taken his Range Rover and phone to the site to frame him.",
      "Carruthers said he didn't understand why people were so upset about \u201cjust a tree,\u201d saying it was \u201calmost as if someone had been murdered.\u201d His lawyer suggested Graham told a desperate lie after being caught.",
      "Prosecutor Richard Wright said the two men were in on it together from the start, with evidence showing Carruthers had gone far out of his way earlier in the day to go near the tree on a reconnaissance mission.",
      "Wright said he couldn\u2019t say who cut the tree and who held the phone, but the two men were the only people in the world with the video on their devices.",
      "As Graham\u2019s vehicle was tracked on its way back toward his home in Carlisle \u2014 about 40 minutes away \u2014 Carruthers received a video from his partner of their infant and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got a better video than that,\u201d Wright said.",
      "\u201cAt the time of that text conversation, the only people in the world who knew the tree had been felled were the men who had had cut it down,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd the only people in the world who had access to the video were the men who had filmed themselves in the act of cutting down the tree: the defendants Graham and Carruthers.\u201d",
      "The next day, the two feverishly exchanged messages after the tree was discovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gone viral. It is worldwide,\u201d Graham said.",
      "Carruthers forwarded a Facebook comment by a man who criticized the \u201cdisgusting behavior\u201d of the \u201cweak\u201d vandals.",
      "Carruthers said he\u2019d like to see the man \u201claunch an operation like we did last night.\u201d",
      "Wright said police never located the chainsaw used to fell the tree, but each man had access to plenty of saws \u2014 a fact they both tried to downplay. Investigators also couldn't find a wedge of wood cut from the trunk to drop the tree in the right direction.",
      "But images on Graham\u2019s phone showed a slice of wood and a chainsaw in the back of his vehicle at his home. A forensic botanist said there was \u201cvery strong evidence\u201d it was the missing wedge that Wright suggested had been taken as a trophy.",
      "Prosecutors offered no evidence of a motive for the crime other than calling it senseless vandalism. But Wright suggested to jurors in his closing argument that the men cut the tree down for \u201ca bit of a laugh\u201d but had failed to realize the anger they would spark in the \u201carboreal equivalent of mindless thuggery.\u201d",
      "The tree was originally valued at more than 620,000 pounds (around $830,000) and damage to the wall was estimated at 1,100 pounds (nearly $1,500).",
      "But on Friday prosecutor Rebecca Brown said those figures are in dispute and are likely lower, but would still easily fit in the top category of harm for sentencing purposes.",

      "Trump touted the framework but acknowledged details are being \"written up.\"",
      "President Donald Trump unveiled the framework for a trade agreement with the United Kingdom on Thursday, marking the first such accord with any nation since the White House suspended some of its far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs last month.",
      "The Trump administration will adjust 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, and will lower auto tariffs from 25% to 10% on the first 100,000 British vehicles sent to the U.S., Trump said.",
      "The agreement left in place 10% tariffs that the U.S. slapped last month on imported goods from nearly all foreign countries.",
      "In exchange, the U.K. will ease trade barriers targeting a set of products, including ethanol, beef and machinery, among other products, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said. That additional market access amounts to $5 billion worth of trade, the White House said.",
      "The U.S. also secured a $10 billion purchase of Boeing airplane parts and a \"secure supply chain\" for pharmaceuticals, according to information shared by Trump on social media on Thursday.",
      "The U.K. will fast-track U.S. imports through customs inspection, Trump said.",
      "The U.S.-U.K. agreement left some details to be worked out later, setting the two countries on a path toward a wider deal, Trump said.",
      "Addressing reports at the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump touted the agreement.",
      "\"This deal is working out for both countries,\" Trump said, noting the \"final details are being written up.\"",
      "In remarks made over a speaker phone on Trump's desk, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said negotiations between the two sides moved toward an agreement in recent weeks.",
      "\"This is a really important deal,\" Starmer said. \"There are no two countries that are closer than our two countries.\"",
      "Starmer acknowledged some details still need to be \"ironed out.\"",
      "The roughly $68 billion in imported goods from the U.K. last year accounted for about 2% of U.S. imported goods, U.S. data showed. The U.S. exported nearly $80 billion worth of products to the U.K. last year, which accounted for almost 4% of U.S. goods exports.",
      "Dozens of nations face potential so-called \"reciprocal tariffs,\" but the U.K. is not among them, since the U.K. buys more than it sells to the U.S. The White House paused the reciprocal tariffs until July, as it seeks to strike trade agreements with dozens of countries.",
      "Testifying before a House subcommittee on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Trump administration had commenced negotiations with 17 of the top 18 U.S. trade partners, excluding China. Those countries account for the vast majority of U.S. foreign trade, Bessent said.",
      "Bessent is set to travel to Geneva, Switzerland, for initial trade negotiations with China on Saturday. The U.S. last month imposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products.",
      "On Thursday, Trump said the negotiations between the U.S. and China would be \"very substantive,\" voicing a willingness to lower the tariffs on Chinese goods.",
      "\"It couldn't go higher,\" Trump said. \"You know it's coming down.\"",
      "Trump's tariff escalation last month roiled markets and triggered recession warnings on Wall Street.",
      "Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned Trump's tariff policy could cause higher inflation and an economic slowdown.",
      "\"If the large increase in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they're likely to generate a rise in inflation and a slowdown of economic growth,\" Powell said Wednesday.",
      "Still, key indicators suggest the economy remains in \"solid shape\", Powell said.",

      "Former President Joe Biden, in a wide-ranging interview on ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday, said he was not surprised by Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in the 2024 presidential election, but not because of her qualifications as a candidate -- instead, pointing to sexism and racism he said had been leveled against her.",
      "\"I wasn't surprised, not because I didn't think the vice president was the most qualified person to be president \u2026 I wasn't surprised because they went the route of -- the sexist route, the whole route,\" Biden said.",
      "He continued: \"I've never seen quite as successful and consistent campaign, undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country -- and a woman of mixed race.\"",
      "But Biden, separately, said he still thinks he would have beaten Trump if he had stayed in the race.",
      "\"Yeah, he still got seven million fewer votes,\" Biden said of Trump, noting by how much he beat Trump in the 2020 election popular vote.",
      "His comments come after several months out of the spotlight for the former president as he and Democrats look to sort out his role post-presidency. Last month, Biden emerged from private life to deliver a speech on Trump's potential impact on Social Security and made an appearance at Harvard University.",
      "Questions persist on the party's priorities and who may be the best to message and communicate on the Democrats' behalf -- questions that extend to both Biden and Harris.",
      "Biden, for his part, told \"The View\" that he's in the midst of self-reflection -- and, to that end, writing a book.",
      "\"Things are moving along and we're getting squared away trying to figure out what the most significant and consequential role I can play, consistent with what I've done in the past,\" he said.",
      "The former president also addressed his relationship with his former running-made-turned-candidate, saying that he and Harris had spoken as recently as Wednesday. Yet, he quickly stopped himself from addressing specifics of their \"frequent\" conversations, including side-stepping any chatter about Harris' possible gubernatorial or potential presidential ambitions.",
      "Sources have told ABC News previously that Harris may be mulling a run for governor of California, her home state; others have speculated she could mount a run for president in 2028 -- a controversial notion within the Democratic Party.",
      "Many of Harris' longtime national supporters told ABC News in March that they are lukewarm on her potentially running for president in 2028; others have called for a full break from the Biden-Harris administration and for the party to consider new standard bearers.",
      "But on Harris' broader political future, Biden said he was hopeful that she stayed involved in some significant way, but stopped short of sharing which route he hopes she takes.",
      "\"She's got a difficult decision to make about what she's going to do. I hope she stays fully engaged. I think she's first-rate, but we have a lot of really good candidates as well. So, I'm optimistic. I'm not pessimistic,\" Biden said.",
      "Biden's remarks don't seem to have mollified progressives who felt he hamstrung Democrats' chances in 2024. Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam Green said in a statement after the interview that the former president is in \"denial\" over both his and Harris' viability as strong candidates on the 2024 ticket, suggesting that anti-establishment Democrats would fare better to lead the party.",
      "\"Joe Biden is in denial about the fact that neither he nor Kamala Harris should have been the 2024 Democratic nominee if we wanted to defeat Donald Trump. In this moment, voters demand authentic anti-establishment figures who will shake up a broken political system and economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people, and that's not Biden or Harris.\"",
      "Asked on \"The View\" to respond to claims that he should have dropped out of the race and endorse Harris sooner, Biden said that Harris still had a long period to campaign and that they worked together \"in every decision I made.\"",
      "Biden also denied reporting that claimed he had advised Harris to suggest that there was no daylight between the two of them -- saying that they were partners and worked together.",
      "\"The View\" co-anchor Sunny Hostin brought up Harris' comments on \"The View\" in October, toward the end of her presidential campaign, when asked if she would have done \"something differently\" from what Biden had done over the last four years. She responded, \"there is not a thing that comes to mind,\" a moment widely seen as one that hurt her among voters who felt she needed to make a cleaner break from the Biden White House.",
      "\"I did not advise her to say that,\" Biden said, adding that he thought Harris meant she would not change any of the successes that the Biden-Harris White House had achieved.",
      "\"She was part of every success we had. We'd argue like hell, by the way,\" Biden added, stressing that the disagreements were all signs of a positive working relationship.",
      "Even though he indicated no tension between himself and Harris, Biden did not answer directly when asked about tension between him and other longtime supporters, including former President Barack Obama, whose administration he served in as vice president.",
      "Asked about what his relationship with Obama is like now, and how he addresses concerns Obama and others reportedly raised over his ability to serve a second term as president, Biden pivoted to why he got out of the race -- and did not mention Obama.",
      "\"The only reason I got out of the race was because I didn't want to have a divided Democratic Party ... I thought it was better to put the country ahead of my interest, my personal interest,\" Biden said.",
      "Biden did say, in his response, that concerns over his age -- 81 during the campaign -- were valid, but pointed to what he still accomplished at the end of his presidency as evidence against claims he had cognitively declined.",

From there, he attended a security conference in Munich, where the vice president left his audience stunned with his lecturing remarks about democracy and scant focus on Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "In March, Vance delivered pointed remarks while in Greenland, scolding Denmark for not investing more in the security of its territory and demanding a new approach. Trump has upset many Greenlanders with his aggressive claims that the U.S. needs to take control of the island away from Denmark.",
      "There's been dealmaking, too.",
      "In India last month, Vance announced after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that they had agreed on a negotiating framework for a U.S.-India trade deal. In Italy, he held talks with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in addition to his separate audiences with the pope and a top Vatican official.",
      "Vance has been accompanied on his overseas trips by his wife, Usha, and their 7- and 5-year-old sons and 3-year-old daughter. The kids are usually in pajamas as they board Air Force Two for the overnight flights.",
      "The Vances have gazed aloft at the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City and been photographed, with the children in traditional Indian dress, in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra. Without their children, the Vances also visited Dachau in Germany.",
      "Brad Blakeman, a former senior official in George W. Bush's administration who has provided planning advice to Vance\u2019s office for some of his foreign travel, said that, while some personal time is woven in, these are not vacations.",
      "\u201cYou try and balance the policy with the culture aspect of the trip so that you\u2019re honoring the customs and culture of the places that you are visiting,\u201d he said. Visiting iconic cultural sites while abroad shows respect and builds rapport with host nations that can enhance diplomacy.",
      "It\u2019s also important to be mindful that the president and vice president travel at the public\u2019s expense, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the balancing act that always has to be done because of the stewardship of the taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who specializes in the U.S. vice presidency, said the journeys also could be intended to build Vance's foreign policy chops.",
      "\u201cPart of foreign travel for a vice president is establishing a national security and diplomatic credential,\u201d he said, noting that it's particularly important for Vance.",
      "At age 40, Vance served just two years in the Senate before ascending to the office.",
      "Vance is also the second-youngest person and the first of the millennial generation to hold the job.",
      "\u201cGenerations\u201d author Jean Twenge, a San Diego State University psychology professor who studies generational differences, said the ease with which Vance moves between work and leisure is emblematic of his generation.",
      "\u201cThe research suggests that, just with internet use and social media use, the lines between work time and family time blur, that you switch tasks much more quickly than, say, Gen Xers or boomers,\u201d she said.",
      "Vance frequently switches gears on the road. Last week, he wedged in a quick beer with service members in Germany \u2014 and autographed the \u201ckegerator\u201d built by one airman \u2014 after days of wall-to-wall official and cultural activities throughout Italy and India.",
      "Usha Vance was originally slated for a solo trip to Greenland with one of their sons to attend a dogsled race. But that plan was scrapped amid growing discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark over the visit and Trump\u2019s tough talk of the U.S. taking the territory away from a NATO ally. Instead, the vice president joined the trip, and their visit was limited to a U.S. military base there.",
      "On his Italy trip, Vance took heat on X for being photographed inside the Sistine Chapel. Photography there is usually forbidden, but the session turned out to have been sanctioned by the Vatican, as has happened on past visits by U.S. dignitaries.",
      "A decision during the same trip to close the Roman Colosseum to the public so Usha Vance and the children could take a tour drew some grumbling from tourists stranded outside. A consumer group has since filed a legal complaint.",
      "In India, the Taj Mahal, normally swarming with tourists, was also closed to visitors to accommodate the Vances, according to local media reports.",
      "American officials are often formally invited to make such cultural diversions, and it\u2019s not unusual for the U.S. Secret Service, which provides protection for top U.S. officials, to ask for the sites to be closed to the public for security reasons during presidential and vice presidential tours.",
      "The Vances appear to have tried on occasion to avoid such disruptions. In France, the family visited the Louvre on a Tuesday, a day when the museum is closed to the public.",
      "Other recent vice presidents also have taken family members along on trips. Presidents do, as well.",
      "As vice president, Democrat Joe Biden often took one of his older granddaughters on trips, a practice he continued as president. Presidents' children, including Malia and Sasha Obama and Chelsea Clinton, went along on some trips with their parents, too.",
      "Practices differ, but the idea is the same: Time in office is short, so make the most of it and expose your children to the world.",
      "Usha Vance said as much during the family visit to India, where her parents were born. She hadn't visited in decades, and her husband and children had never been there.",
      "In an interview with India's NDTV, she said she'd been anxious to make the \u201ctrip of a lifetime\u201d with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been something that I\u2019ve wanted to share with my new nuclear family,\u201d the U.S. second lady said, adding that they knew Vance would have a chance to visit India as vice president. \"We always knew that, when that opportunity arose, we would all come with him.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe think of it as sort of a gateway, the first of many trips to come, I hope,\" she said.",
      "One aim of vice presidential travel abroad is often soft diplomacy, or the building of favorable attitudes toward the U.S. through imagery and symbolism.",
      "When Vance, with his wife of Indian descent and their children, is photographed at the Taj Mahal, it sends a message of solidarity with that nation. When he visits the Vatican and worships there, it emphasizes common ground with Catholics around the world.",
      "Likewise, when Vance appears in public with his children, it could help drive home his quest to encourage large families and build goodwill among American voters, said University of Dayton political scientist Christopher Devine, co-author of \u201cDo Running Mates Matter?\u201d",
      "\u201cI wonder, with JD Vance, if it's an effort to soften his image,\" Devine said. \u201cHe's someone who has not been particularly popular ever since he entered the national scene, and appearing with family tends to make people a little more likable, harder to hate.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge William Sessions ordered Ozturk's transfer to Vermont, where she was last confined before she was taken to Louisiana.

      "Sessions decided not to wait for the transfer, going ahead with the bail hearing.",

      "Ozturk\u2019s lawyers first filed a petition on her behalf in Massachusetts, but they did not know where she was and were unable to speak to her until more than 24 hours after she was detained. A Massachusetts judge later transferred the case to Vermont.",
      "Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university\u2019s response to student activists demanding that Tufts \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\u201d disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.",

      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in March, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite an honor; it\u2019s quite a once in a lifetime,\" he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s quite a responsibility and I think it\u2019s going to lead to bigger and better things, but I think people are going to watch him very closely to see what he\u2019s doing.\u201d",

      "Attorneys for Erik and Lyle Menendez will make their case to a judge that Los Angeles prosecutors should be removed from the resentencing case for the brothers",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, will make their case to a judge Friday that Los Angeles prosecutors should be removed from the brothers' resentencing case.",
      "The brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for fatally shooting their entertainment executive father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home. The brothers were 18 and 21 at the time of the killings. Defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, while prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.",
      "Former LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n had opened the door to possible freedom for the brothers in October by requesting their sentences be reduced to 50 years with the possibility of parole. His office said the case would've been handled differently today due to modern understandings of sexual abuse and trauma, and that the brothers had rehabilitated during their 30 years in prison.",
      "But current district attorney Nathan Hochman has reversed course and opposes the brothers' resentencing. Hochman has said the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes because they have not admitted to lies told during their trials. The Menendez family and lawyers have been heavily critical of the way Hochman has handled the case.",
      "Hochman\u2019s office filed a motion to oppose his removal from the case, dismissing the defense\u2019s concerns as simply \u201cnot being happy\u201d with prosecutors\u2019 opinion on resentencing.",
      "\u201cDisagreeing with the opposing side\u2019s position is not a conflict of interest, it is simply a disagreement,\u201d it said.",
      "While Hochman's conduct is the focus of defense attorneys' petition, they want the case entirely removed from the Los Angeles district attorney's office, in which case the state attorney general's office would usually step in.",
      "However, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a motion this week siding with Hochman, saying the defense had not adequately demonstrated a conflict of interest.",
      "Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said these types of recusal requests are \u201calmost never\u201d granted.",
      "\u201cDefendants don\u2019t usually get to pick their prosecutors,\u201d she said. \u201cOccasionally an individual prosecutor will be recused, but to recuse an entire office is very rare.\u201d",
      "Generally, this only happens if a prosecutor's personal family member is involved or if the district attorney's office received outside payment in a case, Levenson said.",
      "During long-awaited resentencing hearings last month, attorneys engaged in a heated debate over whether material from risk assessments completed by the state parole board at the governor\u2019s order should be admissible in court. The hearings were delayed, and the brothers' lead attorney Mark Geragos said he would move to recuse Hochman from the case.",
      "In a motion filed April 25, Geragos argued that Hochman's bias against the brothers and mistreatment of the Menendez family posed a \u201cgenuine risk\u201d the brothers would not receive a fair hearing.",
      "He pointed to Hochman's demotion of Nancy Theberge and Brock Lunsford, the two deputy district attorneys who filed the original resentencing motion. Theberge and Lunsford have since filed lawsuits against Hochman alleging they were punished for their work on the Menendez case.",
      "Hochman also hired Kathleen Cady, who represented Milton Andersen, the only Menendez family member who opposed the brothers' resentencing at the time, to head his Office of Victim Services. Andersen died in March.",
      "Geragos said no one from the victim services office had ever reached out to the Menendez family to offer support. In mid-April, both Cady and Hochman were present at an organization's rally to condemn the Menendez brothers' resentencing, he said.",
      "Finally, Geragos said the district attorney's office had violated Marsy's Law, which ensures victims in California are treated with fairness and respect.",
      "Menendez cousin Tamara Goodell filed a complaint with the U.S. Attorney's Office in which she wrote Hochman used a \u201chostile, dismissive, and patronizing tone\u201d that left the family \u201cdistressed and feeling humiliated.\u201d",
      "Hochman's motion said the defense had not presented any proof that hiring Cady, a seasoned prosecutor and attorney, prevented his office from treating the Menendez brothers fairly, and that the reassignments of Theberge and Lunsford were \u201cinternal staffing decisions.\"",
      "Marsy's Law also does not give victims the right to seek the removal of a prosecutor, the motion said.",
      "The Menendez brothers are still waiting for the full results of a state parole board risk assessment ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office. The final hearing, scheduled for June 13, will influence whether Newsom grants the brothers clemency.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- An Iranian mechanical engineering student at the University of Alabama has decided to self-deport after six weeks in a Louisiana detention center despite the government dropping a charge behind his initial arrest, his lawyer and fiancee said.",
      "Alireza Doroudi was detained by immigration officials in March as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s widespread immigration crackdown and has been held at a facility in Jena, Louisiana, over 300 miles (480 kilometers) from where he lived with his fiancee in Alabama.",
      "At the time the State Department said Doroudi posed \u201csignificant national security concerns.\u201d",
      "Doroudi\u2019s lawyer, David Rozas, said the government has not offered any evidence to support that claim, however.",
      "Doroudi\u2019s visa was revoked in June 2023. Officials did not give a reason and ignored numerous inquiries from him that year, according to his fiancee, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani.",
      "Back then the University of Alabama advised Doroudi that he was legally allowed to stay but would not be allowed to re-enter if he left, Bajgani added.",
      "This spring the government filed two charges against Doroudi to justify deporting him, saying his visa was revoked and he was not \u201cin status\u201d as a student, Rozas said.",
      "On Thursday a U.S. government attorney withdrew the first of those and said the visa revocation was \u201cprudential,\u201d meaning it would not go into effect until after he leaves the country \u2014 in line with what the university told Doroudi earlier.",
      "Rozas said he has submitted evidence disputing the remaining accusation, that he is not an active student.",
      "A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the case, including Rozas\u2019 characterization of the initial arrest as an error.",
      "The judge in the case, Maithe Gonzalez, gave both sides until the end of May to refile motions and denied Doroudi\u2019s request to redetermine eligibility for bond. Doroudi decided to give up rather than continue to fight deportation.",
      "\u201cHe told me that if they let him to go out, there was a good chance that he would have fought his case for the sake of other students and for the sake of himself,\u201d Bajgani said afterward by phone. \u201cThey just want to make him tired so he can deport himself.\u201d",
      "Bajgani, who drove 11 hours round-trip to attend the hourlong hearing, echoed Rozas\u2019 confusion about why Doroudi was targeted for deportation, saying he has no criminal record, entered the country legally and was not politically outspoken like other students who have been targeted.",
      "She affectionately described her fiance as a \u201cnerd\u201d and \u201ca really big thinker\u201d who spent long days in the lab and enjoys anime. He does not deserve what happened to him, she said, and now the life they built in Alabama is over.",
      "\u201cI am not happy about the whole thing that happened to us, and I need time to grieve for what I am going to put behind and leave,\u201d Bajgani said. \u201cAll the dreams, friendships and dreams we had with each other.\u201d",
      "In a letter to Bajgani from behind bars in April, Doroudi called his detention a \u201cpure injustice.\u201d",

      "Rozas said he has not seen such a case in his 21 years as an immigration attorney. He accused authorities of denying his client due process and forcing him to choose between indefinite detention and self-deporting.",

      "Alabama plans to carry out its latest execution using nitrogen gas next month",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama plans to carry out another execution by nitrogen gas and has set a June execution date for a man convicted of the 1988 killing of a woman.",
      "Gregory Hunt is scheduled to be put to death June 10 for the 1988 beating death of Karen Lane. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday announced the execution date following authorization by the Alabama Supreme Court.",
      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen has now been used in five executions \u2014 four in Alabama and one in Louisiana.  The method involves using a gas mask to force a person to breathe pure nitrogen gas, depriving them of the oxygen needed to stay alive.",
      "If the execution goes forward, Hunt would be the sixth person put to death by the new execution method.",
      "Lane was found dead on Aug. 2, 1988, in the Cordova apartment she shared with another woman. Hunt had been dating the victim, Lane, for about one month before her death, according to court records.",
      "Prosecutors said Hunt broke into her apartment and killed her. A physician who performed an autopsy testified that Lane had sustained some 60 injuries, including 20 to the head.",
      "A jury in 1990 convicted Hunt of capital murder and recommended by a vote of 11-1 that he receive a death sentence.",
      "The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office, in a motion seeking the execution date, wrote there was no doubt about his guilt and said that Hunt had admitted to his cellmate that he killed Lane. Lawyers for Hunt had asked the court to wait on an execution date. They argued that a February U.S. Supreme Court decision could be applicable to his longstanding claim that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained by false or misleading evidence.",
      "Hunt had named nitrogen as his preferred method. The selection was made before Alabama had developed procedures for using gas. Alabama also allows to choose lethal injection or the electric chair.",
      "If the execution goes forward, it would be the third execution in Alabama this year.",

      "Catholic Chicagoans gathered in churches, cheered from classrooms and celebrated from their homes as the historic decision was announced that a native son, Cardinal Robert Prevost, had been elected pope",
      "CHICAGO -- After white smoke billowed Thursday from the Sistine Chapel, signaling that a pope had been chosen, students in every classroom at The Frances Xavier Warde School in Chicago had their eyes glued to TV screens.",
      "As the image of the new pope, Chicago native Cardinal Robert Prevost, appeared onscreen, cheers erupted through the hallways. Children jumped out of their seats, pumping their hands in the air.",
      "\u201cOur students are just beside themselves,\" said Mary Perrotti, director of advancement at the school. \u201cThey\u2019re beyond excited and can\u2019t believe a Chicagoan is their new pope. They were in awe.\u201d",
      "Prevost, 69, took the name Leo XIV and replaced Pope Francis, who died last month. The first American elected pontiff, Pope Leo XIV was born and raised in Chicago before undertaking his ministry in Peru. Catholic Chicagoans gathered in churches and celebrated from their homes as the historic decision was announced.",
      "\u201cOur young people have a model now of a leader with justice and compassion at the heart of his ministries \u2014 and who is from their home,\u201d Perrotti said. \"It\u2019s such a deep feeling of connection for them.\u201d",
      "Prevost was born in 1955 in the south side Chicago neighborhood of Bronzeville and grew up in suburban Dolton, where he attended Mass and elementary school at St. Mary of the Assumption.",
      "He later studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago in Hyde Park and taught in local Catholic schools, including at St. Rita High School, according to the school.",
      "\u201cWe are overjoyed that someone who is beloved and known to us is now the beloved leader of the whole entire church,\u201d said Barbara Reid, a Dominican sister and president of the Catholic Theological Union.",
      "John Doughney, a fellow St. Mary\u2019s grade school graduate from 1969, remembers Prevost as a \u201cfriend to everyone\u201d and a \u201ckind, caring, compassionate young man.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven when he was 12 and 13, it was apparent to all of us that he knew what his calling was,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve shocked all of us if he didn\u2019t go into the priesthood. We\u2019re so proud of him.\u201d",
      "Linda Eickmann, 62, was also born and raised in Dalton and attended St. Mary's. When she saw the news of the new pope on TV, she screamed with joy.",
      "\u201cHow cool is that?\" she said. \"A pope from my elementary school, from my town. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d",
      "Eickmann remembered Prevost's family as being so deeply involved in the St. Mary's community that everyone knew their names. They ran sloppy joe sales to raise money for the school, and all their sons were altar boys, including Prevost.",
      "Raul Raymundo, co-founder of a local community advocacy group called the Resurrection Project, said Thursday was a proud day for Chicagoans and he hoped Pope Leo XIV will \"continue Pope Francis\u2019 legacy and Chicago\u2019s legacy of social justice and compassion, especially in welcoming immigrants.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tears of joy, of hope, of motivation to rise to this moment and leave this world better than we found it,\" said Raymundo, an immigrant from Mexico who grew up in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood.",
      "At Holy Name Cathedral, about two dozen people gathered to pray as light filtered in through the stained glass windows.",
      "Kneeling in a pew, Laurel Legle said she isn't Catholic or even Christian but felt she had to be there after the new American pope's election was announced. She called it a \u201cprofound moment.\u201d",
      "Zo\u00eb Poehlman, a nurse who moved from Kansas City to Chicago a few months ago, described the mood as exciting and hopes there will be citywide celebrations. \u201cIt was just so crazy,\u201d she said.",
      "Father Gregory Sakowicz, the cathedral's rector, said that when the new pope was announced, the sun came out \u2014 a coincidence he described as \u201cGod\u2019s way of remaining anonymous.\u201d He said he was \u201chappily shocked,\u201d and that he had a burning question: Whether the new Pope was a White Sox fan?",
      "When a journalist in the crowd said she\u2019d heard Pope Leo XIV is a Cubs fan, Sakowicz chuckled. \u201cGod bless him,\u201d he said. It turns out he's a Sox fan.",
      "On social media, people swapped memes about Chicago staples \u2014 deep-dish and tavern-style pizza, the Chicago liqueur Mal\u00f6rt and baseball, reflecting the civic pride of Chicago residents as they claimed the pope as one of their own.",
      "Google search traffic for \u201cDa Pope\u201d skyrocketed, and a local T-shirt company announced it would sell \u201cDa Pope\u201d shirts with a blue-and-orange Bears-themed design. Chicagoans overlayed Chicago Bulls intro music to video of the pope exiting the Vatican.",
      "Some joked about replacing communion wafers and wine with tavern-style pizza and Mal\u00f6rt. And the Chicago fast food chain Portillo's jested about shipping its Italian beef to Vatican City.",
      "Many users also proclaimed hope the new pope would represent Chicago's history of social justice.",
      "\u201cFor Catholic Chicagoans, to have a native son who has been born and raised in a city where support and care of all has always been central to who we are as a city, it really speaks volumes,\" Perrotti said.",

      "Two advocacy groups have filed a federal lawsuit asking the courts to halt new Trump Administration vetting procedures for reuniting children who crossed into the U.S. without their parents",
      "McALLEN, Texas -- McALLEN, Texas (AP) \u2014",
      "Two advocacy groups filed a federal lawsuit Thursday asking the courts to halt new Trump Administration vetting procedures for reuniting children who crossed into the U.S. without their parents, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by the National Center for Youth Law and Democracy Forward in federal court in the District of Columbia. It names the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its Office of Refugee Resettlement and seeks a return to prior reunification procedures.",
      "Critics note the government data shows the average time that the children are held in custody before release by the Office of Refugee Resettlement to their sponsors grew from 37 days in January to over 112 days by March.",
      "In February, the Trump administration changed the way it reviews sponsors who want to care for migrant children in government custody, whether parents or relatives of the minors -- or others. More changes followed in March and April when the government started to require identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire. Advocates for the families affected are asking a judge to declare the changes unlawful and return the agency to the policies in place before that.",
      "\u201cThe government has dramatically increased the burden on families in a way that deeply undermines children\u2019s safety. These policy changes are part of a broader unraveling of a bi-partisan, decades-long commitment to support the best interests of unaccompanied children,\u201d said Neha Desai, a managing director at National Center for Youth Law.",
      "Attorneys said they had heard from families who were moments away from receiving their children back when the rules were abruptly changed. Now, many say they are left waiting indefinitely.",
      "\u201cThe administration has reversed years of established children\u2019s welfare protections and replaced them with fear, prolonged detention, and bureaucratic cruelty,\u201d said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward in a statement.",
      "One Mexican woman who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of fears of deportation said she and her 8-year-old son were led to believe repeatedly that they would be reunited, only to find out the new policy changes would derail their plans.",
      "The mother, who arrived first across the border from Mexico, has noticed her son lose hope over the last 11 months, even refusing to unpack after the last time he thought his release from a government-run shelter was imminent.",
      "\u201cHe's seen so many children who have come, leave, and he's stayed behind,\" said the mother, who wasn't part of the lawsuit.",
      "The Trump administration says it is increasing scrutiny of parents and other sponsors before giving them custody of their children who have crossed the border as unaccompanied minors.",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to emails from AP seeking comment in response to the lawsuit filed Thursday afternoon.",
      "Similar restrictions were imposed in 2018 under Trump's first presidency during the rollout of a zero-tolerance policy that separated families and required fingerprinting for all members of a household receiving a child. The administration scaled back the requirements after custody times increased.",

      "Gun access, parental rights and responses to illegal immigration proved recurring topics in legislation approved by at least one North Carolina General Assembly chamber before a key deadline during the two-year session",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Gun access, parental rights and the response to illegal immigration were front and center this week in North Carolina as Republican lawmakers worked to keep their high-priority bills alive, while many other pieces of legislation are likely dead for two years.",
      "Unlike other years with chaotic late-night sessions full of political bargaining, the lead-up to Thursday's biennial \u201ccrossover deadline\u201d looked more orderly and even wrapped up a day early.",
      "GOP legislative veterans chalked it up to a disciplined House work schedule from new Speaker Destin Hall, and perhaps because fewer \u201ccontroversial\u201d bills were considered. It doesn\u2019t hurt that parliamentary maneuvers can be used to bypass the deadline and move bills later \u2014 if top leaders allow. There are also exceptions for bills involving spending or taxes, constitutional amendments and other topics.",
      "\u201cThere are so many ways to skin a cat,\u201d Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters.",
      "Among other things, legislators advanced measures making it easier to retain a concealed handgun permit, as well as ensure immigrants unlawfully in the country can't get certain state benefits, and make it so minors need a parent's consent for more kinds of medical treatments. Since bills on these topics passed one General Assembly chamber, they met the deadline.",
      "Here's a look at some of the recent activity:",
      "After a brief debate, the GOP-led House passed a bill that creates lifetime concealed handgun permits and eases training requirements for some people renewing expired permits with fixed durations.",
      "Democratic Rep. Marcia Morey warned that having renewals safeguards the public, because a lifetime permit wouldn\u2019t account for changing circumstances like addiction or mental illnesses.",
      "But Republican proponents emphasized that permits \u2014 with or without renewals \u2014 don't prevent bad behavior. Earlier this year, Senate Republicans approved legislation that would allow concealed carry without a permit.",
      "In the past week, the House and Senate approved competing bills that would allow certain people with concealed handgun permits \u2014 like teachers \u2014 to carry such guns at their private K-12 schools, if granted permission by school leaders, to promote campus safety.",
      "Amid President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, the House passed a bill Wednesday that would bar several state agencies from supplying benefits to immigrants unlawfully in the country. State public universities are also instructed to verify applicants as legal U.S. residents to be considered for instate tuition and financial aid, according to the bill.",
      "Republicans in both chambers have already signaled support for Trump's immigration policies through bills previously advanced this session.",
      "Minors would be limited in their ability to consent to most medical treatments on their own, except for pregnancy, according to a bill passed Tuesday in the House. A handful of House Democrats joined Republicans in approving it.",
      "Under current law, minors can provide sole consent for treating sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, substance abuse and mental health conditions. Minors could still consult with doctors about those issues, but the bill maintains parents' \u201cessential role\u201d in determining the best medical course of action for their children, Republican Rep. Jennifer Balkcom said.",
      "Some Democrats spoke against the bill, saying it would endanger teenagers who feel less inclined to seek treatment for sensitive issues.",
      "The Senate approved legislation Wednesday that would prevent parents from being cited for neglect because they raised their child consistent with the child's sex assigned at birth.",
      "One House bill with momentum that fell short would have expanded the state\u2019s capital punishment methods from lethal injection to include death by electrocution and a firing squad.",
      "The legislation, which had cleared two committees, would make electrocution the default execution method but allow death-row offenders to choose another option if correction officials have it available.",
      "The firing squad method garnered national attention this year after South Carolina executed the first U.S. prisoner by firing squad in over a decade.",
      "North Carolina hasn't carried out a state execution since 2006 in part due to a legal impasse involving lethal injections and litigation over racial bias in capital trials.",
      "House and Senate leaders will decide the fate of measures from the other chambers.",
      "The state budget process also revs up as House Republicans hope to pass their two-year spending plan before Memorial Day weekend. Negotiations with Senate Republicans, who approved their budget last month, will follow.",
      "In the background is new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, who has his own ideas on a budget and other legislation. Veto threats could wield Stein more influence since Republicans are now one seat short of a veto-proof majority. Republicans have been able to sway some Democrats on key measures.",

      "The founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network has been sentenced to 12 years in prison",
      "NEW YORK -- The founder and former CEO of the cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network was sentenced Thursday to 12 years in prison after a prosecutor labeled him a predator who \u201cpreyed on hope\u201d by enticing vulnerable customers to risk their life savings for a supposedly safe investment.",
      "Alexander Mashinsky, 59, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl, who said a substantial term in prison was necessary for someone who engaged in \u201cextremely serious\u201d crimes that enabled him to pocket over $45 million while some of his customers lost everything and suffered severe psychological harm.",
      "Celsius declared bankruptcy in 2022, exposing risky financial bets Mashinsky had made with some of the $20 billion that thousands of customers poured into the company. He had promised that their money would be safe and secure at Celsius, which pitched itself as a modern-day bank where crypto assets could earn interest.",
      "The defense blamed the collapse of Celsius on a \u201ccataclysmic downturn\u201d of cryptocurrency markets in May and June of 2022 and said in court papers that Mashinsky's \u201cactions were never predatory, exploitative or venal. He never acted with the intent to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "But Assistant U.S. Attorney Allison Nichols cast him as a financial predator, telling the judge Thursday that Mashinsky had deceived customers from the start by exaggerating Celsius' ability to build momentum.",
      "\u201cHe preyed on hope,\u201d she said. \u201cMashinsky knew exactly what he was doing \u2014 selling these people hope.\u201d",
      "She said the customers were not going to be made financially whole regardless of money that can be recovered through bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "Before he was sentenced, Mashinsky sobbed several times as he apologized to customers and referenced his difficult past as his family was able to leave a small Ukrainian town in the former Soviet Union with help from the United States when he was 7.",
      "The family moved to Israel, where Mashinsky served three years in the Israeli Defense Forces as a fighter pilot before coming to America.",
      "Mashinsky said he \u201cnever meant to hurt anybody here after all this country has done for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm truly sorry,\u201d he said, describing himself as someone \u201cwho came from nothing.\u201d",
      "When he pleaded guilty in December, Mashinsky admitted to misleading customers between 2018 and 2022 by promising their investments were safe even as he fabricated Celsius' profitability and put customers' funds at the mercy of uncollateralized loans and undisclosed risky market bets.",
      "His attorney, Marc Mukasey, said victim impact statements submitted to the court were \u201crather brutal\u201d toward his client.",
      "\u201cWe hear the intensity of their pain,\u201d he said. \u201cOur sympathies are with everyone.\u201d",
      "Several victims spoke at the sentencing hearing.",
      "Cameron Crewes, who serves on a victims' committee, called for a \u201charsh sentence,\u201d saying nearly 250 victims died before they could see justice served or get adequately compensated for losses.",
      "\u201cMany people have been wiped out,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Mashinsky \u201cmade tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cAmerica's investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong, but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply.\u201d",

      "State lawmakers approved the measure on Wednesday and Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, is expected to sign it into law.",
      "The bill establishes some rules for the younger guards, including policies that they cannot obtain or use firearms or transport inmates outside of prisons. They also must be supervised when performing \u201ccontact roles\u201d with inmates during the first year-and-a-half on the job.",
      "The push to lower the age for correction officers came after guards walked off the job in February while striking to protest poor working conditions. Hochul was forced to deploy the state National Guard to prisons to maintain operations during the strike.",
      "The governor ended up firing more than 2,000 guards who refused to return to work after the state and guards' union reached a deal to end the walkout, which lasted around three weeks. Hochul has barred the guards who were fired from holding other state jobs in the future.",
      "The state corrections commissioner has since directed the department to begin the process of releasing some inmates early because of a shortage of guards. But the early discharges have been limited to inmates who were convicted of minor crimes and were already set for release in the near future. Inmates convicted of sex crimes, violent felonies or serious felonies such as murder, terrorism and arson would not be eligible for early release, the agency said.",
      "The strike came after the high-profile fatal beating of Robert Brooks at an upstate New York prison in December, which was recorded on guards' body cameras and led to charges against more than a dozen people.",
      "Another incarcerated person, Messiah Nantwi, died on March 1 after being injured in a series of beatings by guards, according to an indictment. Ten guards were charged over Nantwi's death, including two who were charged with murder.",
      "Some other states, including Florida, Maine and New Jersey, allow 18-year-olds to become correction officers.",

      "Senate Democrats have blocked legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency after arguing that the bill needed stronger protections",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats have blocked legislation to regulate stablecoins, a form of cryptocurrency, after arguing that the bill needed stronger protections and airing concerns that it could help President Donald Trump enrich himself.",
      "The bill, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had previously won some Democratic support. But it failed 49-48 on a procedural vote Thursday after Democrats said that they needed to see more changes to the legislation before they could back it.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans would work with Democrats if they allowed the bill to move forward, but they refused. All Democrats voted not to bring it up.",
      "The vote is a blow to one of Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities and a setback for the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has been emboldened to cement its influence in politics and the mainstream financial system. The legislation would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset to make commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "While some Democrats agree that regulation is needed, and several voted to move the bill out of committee, Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry has complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And earlier this week, Trump promoted a dinner he\u2019s set to attend on May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "Among other proposed changes, Democrats said that elected officials and their families should be barred from owning, controlling or promoting stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\u201cThe Senate should not pass a bill that facilitates Trump\u2019s breathtaking corruption and lines his pockets and welcomes other elected officials to do the same,\u201d said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promotor, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previously enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "The legislation could still move forward if the two parties can come to a deal. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who has been helping negotiate the legislation, said in a statement after the vote that he would continue to work on it.",
      "\u201cI remain fully committed to getting this right,\u201d Warner said.",
      "A group of nine Democrats, including Warner, said in a release over the weekend that they could not support the legislation until it included stronger provisions on money laundering, foreign issuers and accountability for those who violate it, among other concerns. They did not mention Trump.",
      "\u201cWe recognize that the absence of regulation leaves consumers unprotected and vulnerable to predatory practices,\u201d the Democrats said.",
      "Thune, the Republican leader, questioned Democrats' motives, speculating that they just wanted to deny Trump a bipartisan win.",
      "\u201cIt makes you wonder if this is about the bill at all,\u201d he said of their opposition.",

      "A flurry of rumors and unconfirmed media reports has fueled fears that agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be descending on schools in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Word spread \u2014 and fast \u2014 as it does in so many moments of rumor and fear.",
      "Early Tuesday morning, dozens of concerned parents and staff members gathered outside of Mundo Verde, one of Washington's most prominent bilingual schools, bracing for a crackdown.",
      "A flurry of rumors and unconfirmed media reports had fueled fears that agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be descending on area schools that were known to have large Hispanic immigrant populations.",
      "The group tensed up as a black SUV slowly cruised past the school twice, then parked up the block. \u201cI think it\u2019s happening,\u201d one parent said.",
      "The man who emerged turned out to be a television news cameraman. People laughed in relief \u2014 for the moment.",
      "It was a rare moment of levity in the middle of several days of tension and fear as Washington's Hispanic community waits for President Donald Trump's pledge of an immigration crackdown to take shape in the nation's capital. It mirrors, in some ways, similar fears around the country.",
      "The reports of a crackdown on bilingual schools in the District turned out to be a false alarm that day \u2014 but only partially false. While the schools were on high alert, ICE agents reportedly raided several local restaurants, including Millie's in northwest Washington. On Wednesday, staffers at Millie's were reluctant to discuss the incident, with one manager \u2014 who did not give a name \u2014 saying the restaurant had been descended upon by \u201cfascists.\u201d",
      "Staff at Millie's referred all questions to owner Bo Blair, who did not respond to an emailed request for comment. ICE also did not immediately respond to a request for details on what establishments had been raided and whether anyone had been detained.",
      "The ambient fear among Washington's robust Hispanic community, though, remains. It is exacerbated by concerns that the city government will not help them. Washington, D.C., declared itself a sanctuary city in 2020 via the Sanctuary Values Act. Among the most prominent aspects of that declaration is a \u201cprohibition on cooperation with federal immigration agencies\u201d by city officials and agencies.",
      "But Mayor Muriel Bowser has publicly distanced herself from that status ever since Trump was elected to a second term. Bowser has worked hard to maintain a positive relationship with Trump and with congressional Republicans, who hold significant power over the District of Columbia.",
      "In February, she publicly characterized the sanctuary city designation as \u201can expression of our values,\u201d but not a binding legal concept. The city and its agencies, she said, would not hinder or defy any federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s misleading to suggest to anyone that \u2026 this is a place where you can violate immigration laws,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cThe city is not an immigration enforcement agency. No city is. The federal government is.\u201d",
      "Washington's Hispanic community, and the schools and charities that serve it, have spent months quietly preparing for the worst-case scenario.",
      "\u201cMy community is really scared,\u201d said one senior official at a local bilingual school, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect her students, parents and staff. \u201cWe have a whole crisis management plan if ICE was to come to the door.\u201d",
      "That plan includes posting \u201cprivate property\u201d signs all around the school perimeter and running special trainings for staff members on how to handle the arrival of ICE agents. Parents have been advised to sign \u201ccustody agreements\u201d stipulating who would be authorized to take care of their children if they were suddenly detained. The administrator estimated that as much as 35% of the school's student body \u201ccould be undocumented.\u201d",
      "In February, a collection of bilingual charter schools hosted a \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d training session for parents conducted by an immigration attorney. Dozens of families attended, although many were afraid to attend in person and participated via Zoom.",
      "The attorney, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect her clients, said requests for \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d training sessions have surged in the past six months, \u201cAnybody who was anything less than a full citizen is going, \u2018Oh my God, what does this mean for me?\u2019\u201d",
      "The attorney said that \u201cmanaging this culture of fear\u201d has become a steadily increasing part of her job. And for clients who are undocumented, \u201cI don't really have advice for them other than to just stay off the radar.\u201d",
      "At Mundo Verde this week, parents set up tables on the sidewalk so they could work on their laptops and stay all day, just in case. Another school, Oyster-Adams Bilingual School, established a volunteer escort network to help bring students safely to and from the school building.",
      "Rio Sigala, a Mundo Verde parent, praised the immediate rallying of physical support from the school's non-Hispanic parents and community.",
      "\u201cAs a Latina, seeing how many parents are out here in solidarity makes you feel less alone,\u201d Sigala said. \u201cYou walk around kind of scared and to see everyone come out, it feels hopeful.\u201d",

The bellwether cases set the legal tone for another 7,500 military family members, civilians and service members whose lawsuits are still awaiting resolution.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leslie Kobayashi handed down the ruling Wednesday, awarding from $5,000 to more than $104,000 to each plaintiff. In her order, Kobayashi wrote that it was clear that even though the contaminated water could have caused many of the kinds of medical problems the military families experienced, there wasn't enough evidence to prove a direct link.",
      "The amount awarded to each of plaintiff was significantly smaller than the roughly $225,000 to $1.25 million that their attorney, Kristina Baehr, requested during the two-week trial in federal court in Honolulu.",
      "As bellwether plaintiffs, the 17 were chosen because they were seen as representative of the thousands of other people whose cases are still pending.",
      "Baehr called the damage awards disappointing but said the families \u201cprevailed against all odds against the U.S. Government.\u201d",

      "Baehr said the legal team was reviewing options for resolving the thousands of remaining cases.",
      "The government admitted liability for the spill before the trial began, but its attorneys disputed whether the plaintiffs were exposed to enough jet fuel to cause the vomiting, rashes and other alleged negative health effects.",

      "Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature have voted to kill most of the top spending priorities of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature voted Thursday to kill most of the top spending priorities of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, including legalizing marijuana, even as both sides negotiate a tax cut.",
      "The Legislature's Republican-controlled budget committee voted along party lines to kill more than 600 budget proposals put forward by Evers, including spending more state money on child care providers, expanding Medicaid and raising taxes on joint tax filers those who earn more than $1 million.",
      "Republicans did the same thing in each of Evers' previous three budgets and had said they were going to do it again. Some of the killed ideas, like allowing absentee ballots to be processed before polls open on Election Day, have had bipartisan support in the past and could return in another form.",
      "The cuts come amid uncertainty about how much federal money the state will get as President Donald Trump's administration moves to drastically reduce government spending. Evers' budget as introduced would have spent about $119 billion money over two years, a 20% increase in spending.",
      "Evers and Republicans have been talking about a tax cut plan they both could support but have not released details. Republicans argue that most of the state's roughly $4 billion surplus should be returned as tax cuts rather than used to support spending on K-12 schools, the University of Wisconsin and other state programs.",
      "Evers proposals stripped from the budget on Thursday include: eliminating the tax on tips; increasing funding to combat what some people call forever chemicals or PFAS; targeted property tax cuts for veterans, seniors and people with disabilities; spending $128 million on new financial aid targeting low-income college students and adding gender-neutral language such as \u201cperson inseminated\u201d to state law.",
      "\u201cRepublicans talk a lot about what they\u2019re against, but not what they\u2019re for,\" Evers said in a statement. \u201cThere are pressing challenges facing our state. Wisconsinites are sick and tired of having a do-nothing Legislature. Republicans must get serious about getting things done.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Howard Marklein, co-chair of the budget committee, said \u201cpopular items\u201d could return as separate bills. Co-chair Rep. Mark Born said just because the committee was rejecting Evers' approach to various issues facing the state doesn't mean they won't be addressed in other ways.",
      "The vote gutting the governor's spending plan marks the first step in what will be a weekslong process of slowly rebuilding the two-year budget to include more Republican priorities. Evers can make more changes with his broad veto power once the Legislature passes a budget, which typically happens in late June or early July.",
      "However, Republicans have talked about taking longer to pass a budget this year, or passing only certain top priority spending bills, in reaction to a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling upholding a line-item budget veto Evers made in 2023 that extended a K-12 spending increase for 400 years.",
      "That ruling affirmed the governor's power to veto digits from a budget bill, allowing him to create new amounts and years not envisioned by lawmakers.",
      "The court noted in its ruling, however, that the Legislature could rein in the governor's veto powers in several ways. That includes passing a constitutional amendment that\u2019s under consideration curbing a governor\u2019s veto power and drafting budget bills in a way to prevent a governor from making such a sweeping veto.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency faced fresh upheaval Thursday just weeks before the start of hurricane season when the acting administrator was pushed out and replaced by another official from the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The abrupt change came the day after Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL who held the job for the last few months, testified on Capitol Hill that he did not agree with proposals to dismantle an organization that helps plan for natural disasters and distributes financial assistance.",

      "The nation\u2019s infant mortality rate is falling",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's infant mortality rate dropped last year after two years of hovering at a late-pandemic plateau.",
      "Some experts think one reason for the drop could be a vaccination campaign against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "The infant mortality national rate dropped to about 5.5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted Thursday. That's down from about 5.6 per 1,000 live births, where it had been the previous two years.",
      "CDC officials believe the findings will not change much when the final numbers come out later this year.",
      "Infant mortality is the measure of how many babies die before they reach their first birthday. Because the number of babies born in the U.S. varies from year to year, researchers instead calculate rates to better compare infant mortality over time.",
      "U.S. infant deaths fell to about 19,900 last year, according to CDC data, compared with about 20,150 in 2023.",
      "The U.S. infant mortality rate has been worse than other high-income countries, which experts have attributed to poverty, inadequate prenatal care and other things. Even so, the U.S. rate generally has improved over the decades because of medical advances and public health efforts.",
      "The 2022 and 2023 levels were up from 5.44 per 1,000 in 2021 \u2014 the first statistically significant jump in the rate in about two decades. Experts attributed those years to a rebound in RSV and flu infections after two years of pandemic precautions.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to prevent the toll on infants \u2014 one was a lab-made antibody shot for infants that helps the immune system fight off the virus, and the other was giving an RSV vaccine to women between 32 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "That effort is probably one explanation for the improvement, said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim chief medical officer for the March of Dimes.",
      "In a separate CDC report released Thursday, researchers noted infant hospitalizations in the 2024-25 respiratory virus season were more than 40% lower than past averages.",
      "But more work needs to be done to tease out other reasons, Williams added, noting that much of the improvement in 2024 was in infants who were at least one month old when they died. That could be explained not only by fewer deaths from RSV but also from other causes, like accidents, homicides or SIDS.",

      "Democratic voters in Wisconsin have asked the state\u2019s liberal-controlled Supreme Court to throw out the battleground state\u2019s current congressional district boundaries after a similar request was rejected last year",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Democratic voters on Thursday asked the liberal-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court to throw out the battleground state\u2019s current congressional district boundaries after a similar request was rejected last year.",
      "Republicans currently hold six of the state's eight U.S. House seats \u2014 but only two of those districts are considered competitive. The petition seeks to have the state\u2019s congressional district lines redrawn ahead of the 2026 midterms. Filed on Wednesday and made public Thursday, the petition comes from the Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and also filed last year's request.",
      "The new petition argues that the court's decision to redraw maps for state legislative districts a couple years ago has opened the door to revisiting maps for U.S. House districts. The petition asks for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly, skipping lower courts.",
      "The chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, Brian Schimming, called the lawsuit \"a desperate attempt by far-left Democrats who have shown time and time again that they can\u2019t win without rigged maps.\u201d",
      "But Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who criticized the state Supreme Court for not hearing the lawsuit last year, praised the new effort.",
      "\u201cThe residents of Wisconsin deserve fair maps,\u201d Pocan said in a text message. \u201cHopefully this will provide that.\u201d",
      "The court is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices. Democratic-backed candidate Susan Crawford won an April election to ensure the court will remain under a 4-3 liberal majority until at least 2028.",
      "Redistricting was an issue in that race after Crawford spoke at a virtual event billed as a \u201cchance to put two more House seats in play,\u201d a move that Republicans said shows that Crawford is committed to redrawing congressional districts to benefit Democrats. Crawford denied those allegations.",
      "The court in 2023 ordered new maps for the state Legislature, saying the Republican-drawn ones were unconstitutional. The GOP-controlled Legislature, out of fear that the court would order maps even more unfavorable to Republicans, passed ones drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Democrats made gains in the state Legislature in the November election and are hoping to take majority control in 2026.",
      "When ordering the state legislative maps redrawn, the Wisconsin Supreme Court said the earlier conservative-controlled court was wrong in 2021 to say that maps drawn that year should have as little change as possible from the maps that were in place at the time. The latest lawsuit argues that decision warranted replacing the congressional district maps that were drawn under the \u201cleast change\u201d requirement.",
      "In 2010, the year before Republicans redrew the congressional maps, Democrats held five seats compared with three for Republicans.",
      "Democrats are eyeing two congressional seats for possible flipping in 2026.",
      "Western Wisconsin\u2019s 3rd District is represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who won an open seat in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired, and won reelection in 2024.",
      "Southeastern Wisconsin\u2019s 1st District, held by Republican Rep. Bryan Steil since 2019, was made more competitive under the latest maps but still favors Republicans.",
      "The current congressional maps in Wisconsin, drawn by Evers, were approved by the state Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022 declined to block them from taking effect.",

      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it will no longer track the cost of weather disasters, including floods, heat waves, wildfires and more",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will no longer track the cost of climate change-fueled weather disasters, including floods, heat waves, wildfires and more. It is the latest example of changes to the agency and the Trump administration limiting federal government resources on climate change.",
      "NOAA falls under the U.S. Department of Commerce and is tasked with daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring. It is also parent to the National Weather Service.",
      "The agency said its National Centers for Environmental Information would no longer update its Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024, and that its information \u2014 going as far back as 1980 \u2014 would be archived.",
      "For decades, it has tracked hundreds of major events across the country, including destructive hurricanes, hail storms, droughts and freezes that have totaled trillions of dollars in damage.",
      "The database uniquely pulls information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s assistance data, insurance organizations, state agencies and more to estimate overall losses from individual disasters.",
      "NOAA Communications Director Kim Doster said in a statement that the change was \u201cin alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.\u201d",
      "Scientists say these weather events are becoming increasingly more frequent, costly and severe with climate change. Experts have attributed the growing intensity of recent debilitating heat, Hurricane Milton, the Southern California wildfires and blasts of cold to climate change.",
      "Assessing the impact of weather events fueled by the planet's warming is key as insurance premiums hike, particularly in communities more prone to flooding, storms and fires. Climate change has wrought havoc on the insurance industry, and homeowners are at risk of skyrocketing rates.",
      "One limitation is that the dataset estimated only the nation's most costly weather events.",
      "The information is generally seen as standardized and unduplicable, given the agency's access to nonpublic data, and other private databases would be more limited in scope and likely not shared as widespread for proprietary reasons. Other datasets, however, also track death estimates from these disasters.",
      "Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, pointed to substitutes from insurance brokers and the international disaster database as alternative sources of information.",
      "Still, \u201cThe NOAA database is the gold standard we use to evaluate the costs of extreme weather,\u201d Masters said, \u201cand it\u2019s a major loss, since it comes at a time when we need to better understand how much climate change is increasing disaster losses.\u201d",
      "These moves also don\u2019t \u201cchange the fact that these disasters are escalating year over year,\u201d Kristina Dahl, vice president of science at nonprofit climate organization Climate Central. \u201cExtreme weather events that cause a lot of damage are one of the primary ways that the public sees that climate change is happening and is affecting people.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we highlight those events when they\u2019re happening,\u201d she added. \u201cAll of these changes will make Americans less safe in the face of climate change.\u201d",
      "The move, reported Thursday by CNN, is yet another of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to remove references to climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the weather from the federal government\u2019s lexicon and documents.",
      "Trump has instead prioritized allies in the polluting coal, oil and gas industries, which studies say are linked or traced to climate damage.",
      "The change also marks the administration's latest hit overall to the weather, ocean and fisheries agency.",
      "The Trump administration fired hundreds of weather forecasters and other federal NOAA employees on probationary status in February, part of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency efforts to downsize the federal government workforce. It began a second round of more than 1,000 cuts at the agency in March, more than 10% of its workforce at the time.",
      "At the time, insiders said massive firings and changes to the agency would risk lives and negatively impact the U.S. economy. Experts also noted fewer vital weather balloon launches under NOAA would worsen U.S. weather forecasts.",
      "More changes to the agency are expected, which could include some of those proposed in the president's preliminary budget.",
      "The agency's weather service also paused providing language translations of its products last month \u2014 though it resumed those translations just weeks later.",

      "The Trump administration is halting some hiring at the federal Bureau of Prisons, the crisis-plagued agency where chronic understaffing has led to long overtime shifts and the use of prison nurses, teachers, cooks and other workers to guard inmates.",
      "The move, which coincides with President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive campaign to cut the cost and size of the federal government, was announced Thursday by the agency\u2019s newly appointed director, William K. Marshall III. Some union officials characterized the move as a \u201chiring freeze,\u201d though the agency denied that, saying some positions would continue to be filled.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons will maintain current staffing levels at least through the end of the fiscal year, Sept 30, Marshall wrote in an email to staff titled \u201cStaffing and Hiring Decisions.\u201d The agency will still work to fill critical positions, such as correctional officers and medical clinicians, and will honor job offers that are currently pending on an accelerated timeline.",
      "The change comes days after Trump ordered the Bureau of Prisons to reopen Alcatraz, the fabled former penitentiary in San Francisco Bay that last held inmates more than six decades ago.",
      "The dilapidated facility, now a popular museum and tourist attraction, will likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild at a time when the federal prison system is facing a $3 billion repair backlog and myriad other woes. Marshall said this week that the cash-strapped agency will conduct \u201can immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps\u201d on Trump\u2019s Alcatraz directive.",
      "Since mid-March, 11 federal prison inmates have died. Last week, an inmate in Miami tested positive for tuberculosis, while others were diagnosed with COVID-19. In February, a Bureau of Prisons official told Congress that more than 4,000 beds within the system \u2014 the equivalent of at least two full prisons \u2014 are unusable because of dangers like leaking or failing roofs, mold, asbestos or lead.",
      "In his announcement Thursday, Marshall told employees that changing the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 hiring practices are necessary to \u201cavoid more extreme measures\" as it navigates budgetary challenges. The plan will \u201cmaintain stability and protect the livelihood of our workforce to the fullest extent possible,\" he wrote.",
      "The hiring freeze is likely to exacerbate a staffing crisis at the agency, which has more than 4,000 unfilled positions, union officials said. The administration previously eliminated some pay bonuses that were credited with retaining and attracting new staff. In one example of staffing problems, a federal jail in Brooklyn had more than 150 vacancies despite a hiring surge that increased staffing by about 20%. Before that, the facility was operating at about 55% of full staffing, according to court filings.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re already severely understaffed, they took our retention pay, they have been literally stripping all the things away from us that matter,\u201d said Aaron McGlothin, union president at the federal prison in Mendota, California. \u201cFreezing an already severely understaffed agency will lead to tragic consequences, we are tired of doing more with less.\"",
      "Trump suspended hiring across many parts of the federal bureaucracy when he took office in January, but initially spared the Bureau of Prisons and other law enforcement agencies. At the same time the administration and billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency cut probationary workers and offered buyouts to hundreds of thousands of workers across the government.",
      "Trump previously imposed a hiring freeze at the Bureau of Prisons during his first term, in 2017. That freeze was blamed for accelerating the glut of vacancies and overtime spending \u2014 a trend that has continued for years as the agency has struggled to hire and retain employees. Some correctional officers have been pressed into duty for 16-hour shifts and 80-hour weeks.",
      "\u201cStaff are mentally and physically exhausted from the do more with less directives,\u201d McGlothin said, noting a wave of retirements in the wake of Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cNothing ever good comes from these situations and I pray no one is injured or killed over these senseless decisions.\u201d",
      "An ongoing investigation from The Associated Press has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons, an agency with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates, 122 facilities and an annual budget of about $8 billion.",
      "AP reporting has revealed rampant misconduct, including staff-on-inmate sexual abuse, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including inmate assaults and suicides.",
      "In December, the agency announced it was permanently closing its women\u2019s prison in Dublin, California, in the wake of rampant sexual abuse by employees, including the warden. It addition, it idled six prison camps across the country, moves it said were done to address \u201csignificant challenges, including a critical staffing shortage, crumbling infrastructure and limited budgetary resources.\u201d",

      "The criminal complaint against 42-year-old Jeffrey Rupnow of Madison is packed with details about how his daughter, 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, expressed a hatred of humanity following her parents' divorce and how he hoped he could bond with her through guns. It also says the girl meticulously planned the attack, including building a cardboard model of the school and scheduling the shooting to end with her suicide.",
      "Jeffrey Rupnow was scheduled to make his initial court appearance Friday afternoon. Online court records did not list an attorney for him on Thursday. He did not respond to a message The Associated Press left on his Facebook page, and no one returned voicemails left at possible telephone listings for him and his ex-wife, Melissa Rupnow.",
      "Natalie Rupnow entered Abundant Life Christian School, a religious school in Madison that offers prekindergarten through high school classes, on Dec. 16 and opened fire in a study hall. She killed teacher Erin Michelle West and 14-year-old student Rubi Bergara and injured six others before she killed herself.",

      "They also recovered a 9 mm Glock handgun that Jeffrey Rupnow had purchased for her from the room and a .22-caliber Sig Sauer pistol from a bag the girl was carrying, the complaint says. Jeffrey Rupnow had given that gun to her as a Christmas present in 2023, the complaint says.",
      "Also in the bag were three magazines loaded with .22 ammunition and a 50-round box of 9 mm ammunition. She wore a black T-shirt emblazoned with a bull's-eye during the attack.",
      "Jeffrey Rupnow told investigators that his daughter lived with him but had been struggling with his divorce from her mother in 2022, saying she hated her life and wanted to kill herself. He said she used to cut herself to the point where he had to lock up all the knives in his house.",
      "She had been in therapy to learn how to be more social until the spring before the attack, he told investigators. Her mother, Melissa Rupnow, told detectives that the therapist told her that Natalie was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from the divorce. One of Natalie's friends told investigators that Jeffrey Rupnow was \u201cfrequently verbally aggressive\u201d with Natalie and that she had told him that her father was a \u201cdrinker,\u201d according to the complaint.",
      "Jeffery Rupnow told investigators that took Natalie shooting with him on a friend's land about two years before the Abundant Life attack. She enjoyed it, and he came to see guns as a way to connect with her. But he was shocked at how her interest in firearms \u201csnow balled,\u201d he told investigators.",
      "He kept Natalie's pistols in a gun safe, telling her that if she ever need them the access code was his Social Security number entered backward. About 10 days before the school attack, he texted a friend and said that Natalie would shoot him if he left \u201cthe fun safe open right now,\" according to the complaint.",
      "The day before the school attack he took the Sig Sauer out of the safe so Natalie could clean it. But he got distracted and wasn't sure if he put the weapon back in the safe or locked it, according to the complaint.",
      "A search of Natalie's room netted a six-page manifesto the girl had written entitled \u201cWar Against Humanity.\u201d She started the piece by describing humanity as \u201cfilth\u201d and saying she hated people who don't care and \u201csmoke their lungs out with weed or drink as much as they can like my own father.\u201d",
      "She wrote about how she admired school shooters, how her mother was not in her life and how she obtained her weapons \u201cby lies and manipulation, and my fathers stupidity.\u201d",
      "Investigators also discovered maps of the school and a cardboard model of the building, along with a handwritten schedule that detailed how she would being the attack at 11:30 a.m. and wipe out the first and second floors of the school by 11:55 a.m. She planned to end the attack by 12:10 p.m. with a notation \u201cready 4 Death.\u201d",
      "She had been communicating online with people around the world about her fascination with school shootings and weapons, Acting Madison Police Chief John Patterson said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.",
      "Jeffery Rupnow sent a message to a detective two weeks after the school shooting saying that his biggest mistake was teaching Natalie how to handle guns safely and urging police to warn people to change their gun safe combinations every two to three months, the complaint said.",

      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

      "From the US perspective, the trebling of tariffs is a tax on foreigners that \"wins\" revenue for US Treasury. From the UK perspective, the tariff is a tax on domestic consumers that increases inflation, so a lower value is in and of itself good.",
      "Over at the Bank of England, the lack of retaliation and acceptance of diverted goods from Asia are among the reasons that inflation is now rising more gently, which has enabled today's interest rate cut with more to come.",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",

      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve said Trump's barrage of tariffs were generating too much uncertainty to predict its next moves.",
    "story": [
      "The US central bank has warned that President Donald Trump's tariffs have created \"so much uncertainty\" that it is unsure what to do about interest rates.",
      "The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday it would keep interest rates unchanged, despite pressure from Trump to lower borrowing costs.",
      "But Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economic fallout from Trump's tariffs meant it was \"not at all clear\" what the bank should do next.",
      "The decision marked the third in a row without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate hovering around 4.3%.",
      "Powell said if Trump's tariff policies remain in place they were likely \"to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment\".",
      "Typically, the Fed cuts rates if it believes the economy is struggling and raises them if prices start to rise too quickly.",
      "But the bank - which is set up to make policy independent of the White House -said tariffs had raised the risk of both an economic slowdown and faster price rises, complicating its next move.",
      "\"It's really not at all clear what it is we should do,\" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. \"There's so much uncertainty.\"",
      "Wednesday's decision is the Fed's first since Trump's tariff announcements last month raised import taxes on goods from countries around the world, with imports from China facing duties of at least 145%.",
      "Logistics firms and ports in the US have since reported sharp drops in trade, while analysts have warned that the risk of recession has ramped up significantly since the start of the year.",
      "Trump, who promised lower rates while campaigning for re-election last year, has called on the Fed to lower rates \"pre-emptively\" and flirted with firing the head of the bank, criticising him as \"a major loser\" and \"Mr Too Late\" for not cutting rates fast enough.",
      "The European Central Bank cut interest rates last month, citing concerns about the economy due to the trade tensions. The Bank of England is widely expected to take a similar step this week.",
      "US-China trade",
      "Officials from the US and China are set to meet this week, but the scope of the talks remains unclear. Trump on Wednesday dismissed the idea of lowering tariff rates pre-emptively to help trade negotiations.",
      "Powell said the talks had the potential to change the economic picture \"materially\".",
      "\"Usually, things clarify and the appropriate direction becomes clear,\" he said. \"Right now it's very hard to say what that would be. In the meantime, the economy is doing fine.\"",
      "The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year for the first time since 2022. But officials said those figures had been distorted by firms rushing goods into the country ahead of tariffs rather than a decline in wider activity.",
      "Hiring remained unexpectedly strong last month, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows of 4.2% while the US stock market has largely recovered from the sharp declines it saw last month.",
      "Powell said those figures gave the Fed time to wait.",
      "\"We can move quickly when that's appropriate but we think right now the appropriate thing to do is wait and see how things evolve,\" he said.",

      "The trade deal won't come into force for up to a year, so don't expect to notice any immediate changes.",
      "Over time though, the UK government says lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice.",
      "This deal could also be a big win for UK businesses which manufacture the goods which have seen tariffs slashed, such as car makers and whisky distillers.",
      "For example, tariffs on whisky and gin being imported to India from the UK will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal. Car tariffs will fall from more than 100% to 10%.",
      "That will provide a boost to those two industries, which look set to be hit hard by US tariffs, as it will mean Indian companies wanting to import those products will pay less import charges than before.",
      "If businesses end up exporting more goods to India and make higher profits, this could lead to them spending more on hiring staff, investing and also paying more tax.",
      "In India, consumers could see much more choice among the goods which have been included under the deal. Clothing manufacturing businesses and jewellers will also be able to access the UK market which will boost their margins.",
      "How important is this for the UK and India?",
      "This deal has been a long time in the making, with on-off negotiations going on for some three years.",
      "However it appears US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on goods entering America has prompted other world leaders to consider striking free-trade deals with one another.",
      "The UK's deal with India is its third biggest after its agreements with Australia and Japan. For context, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU.",
      "The EU is the biggest trade partner for both the UK and India. Therefore, a free trade agreement between India and the EU would be more significant than the one with the UK. Both India and the EU have said they aim to finalise this by the end of 2025.",
      "Last year trade between the UK and India totalled \u00a342bn. The UK government has said this deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",
      "It is said over time it will boost the UK economy by \u00a34.8bn. This is a tiny proportion of the UK economy which was worth \u00a32,851bn last year.",
      "However, India is also forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. It is also home to 1.45bn people - about 20 times the population of the UK -which is a lot of potential customers.",
      "The UK is also a high priority trading partner for India, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1tn (\u00a3750bn) by 2030.",
      "What does this mean for visas?",
      "One of the reasons the UK India free trade deal has taken so long to reach is that India had made big demands about visas for Indian professionals and students to work and study abroad.",
      "The British government said this deal does not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.",

    "summary": "Opposition parties claim the new trade agreement means Indian workers will be cheaper for employers to hire.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has hit back against claims by opposition parties that the newly-agreed trade deal with India could disadvantage British workers.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC there was \"no situation\" in which he would \"ever tolerate\" British workers being undercut as a result of a trade agreement.",
      "One part of the deal extends an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years - meaning people on short-term visas will only make social security payments in their home country when working abroad.",
      "Opposition parties claim this could mean Indian workers are cheaper to employ than British workers - not least since UK employer Nics have just risen.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed she had refused a similar trade-off when she was business secretary, because the deal contains \"two-tier taxes\" which would cost the UK \"hundreds of millions\".",
      "Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the exemption risked \"undercutting British workers at a time when they're already being hammered by Trump's trade war and Labour's misguided jobs tax\".",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described the deal as \"truly appalling\", adding: \"This government doesn't give a damn about working people.",
      "Four things you need to know about UK-India trade deal",
      "Chris Mason: Can Delhi deal mask Labour's problems at home?",
      "But Reynolds said the deal would not impact British workers, pointing out the UK has 16 agreements preventing double taxation of work, which cover more than 50 countries - including the US, EU and South Korea.",
      "\"The Conservatives recently, well a few years ago when they were in government, signed one with Chile for five years. So no, British workers are not being undercut,\" he said.",
      "\"What the Conservatives are confused about, and Reform as well, is a situation where a business in India seconds someone for a short period of time to the UK, or a UK business seconds a worker to India for a short period of time, where you don't pay in simultaneously now to both social security systems,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "But Conservative MP Matt Vickers said his party was not \"confused\".",
      "\"We always want to see trade deals done with other countries\u2026 that's what we had Brexit so we could open up some of those deals, but actually this is a bad deal.\"",
      "Reynolds said the deal was a \"huge economic win for the UK and would deliver \"faster growth, higher wages, more tax revenue brilliant wins for goods and for services\".",
      "He said previously that Indian workers would still be required to pay the NHS immigration surcharge and would not be eligible for benefits from the National Insurance system.",
      "The Business Secretary also dismissed opposition claims that many more Indian workers would come to the UK than British workers would go to India.",
      "'Gamechanger' for Scotch whisky industry",
      "The deal - which took three years to negotiate - will make it easier for UK firms to export some goods including whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK.",
      "Last year, trade between the two countries totalled \u00a342.6bn. The government has said the deal would boost that trade by an additional \u00a325.5bn a year by 2040.",
      "The UK government said lowering tariffs on the likes of clothing, jewellery, and frozen prawns \"could\" lead to cheaper prices and more choice for consumers.",
      "The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), which is set to benefit from Indian tariffs being lowered, said it could increase Scotch exports to the country by \u00a31bn over the next five years, creating 1,200 jobs across the UK",
      "Tariffs on Scotch whisky are set to fall from 150% to 75% and are expected to be tapered down to 40% over the next decade.",
      "Jean-Etienne Gourgues, chair of the SWA and chief executive of Chivas Brothers, said the deal was a \"gamechanger\" for the industry.",
      "\"We will have suddenly 10 million consumers who cannot today afford our product, which will be in a position to afford our product so that's a big change for us,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He added it would provide \"a lot of safety and long term safety\" for the business.",
      "\"We're going to increase the number of jobs because everything is produced in Scotland, so the more we produce the more people we need so it will have a straight impact directly for us but also indirectly with all the companies we're working [with],\" he said.",
      "The Department for Business and Trade said for the first time, UK firms would have \"guaranteed and unprecedented access to India's vast procurement market\" with access to \"approximately 40,000 tenders with a value of at least \u00a338bn a year\".",
      "\"We are the only other country in the world with access to that procurement market so when you have that kind of success that will involve more British workers on a short term basis going to India,\" Reynolds said.",
      "He said it was the biggest trade deal the UK had done since Brexit and that it would \"benefit every part of the UK, but particularly Scotland, the North, the Midlands because of where some of our industries are located\"."

      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",

    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",

      "Prices in the UK rose by 2.6% in the 12 months to March, less than in the previous month but still above the Bank of England's target.",
      "The Bank of England moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and has cut rates twice in 2025, taking rates to 4.25%.",

      "Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time.",

      "CPI was 2.6% in the year to March 2025, down from 2.8% in the 12 months to February.",
      "It was a bigger drop than analysts had expected, which the ONS said was driven by a fall in clothing and shoe prices.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.",
      "Core CPI doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends.",
      "This was 3.4% in March, down slightly from 3.5% in February.",
      "Why are prices still rising?",
      "Inflation has fallen significantly since hitting 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.",
      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",
      "Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.",
      "Why does putting up interest rates help to lower inflation?",
      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",
      "The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.",
      "For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.",
      "Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.",

    "story": [
      "More than four in 10 universities in England are expecting to be in a financial deficit by this summer, according to new report from the Office for Students (OfS).",
      "The OfS, which regulates higher education providers, said universities were closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but \"significant reform and efficiencies\" were needed to turn the tide.",
      "It said a drop in international students coming to the UK was the main reason for the worsening financial position.",
      "Universities UK (UUK) said the report was \"deeply sobering\", while the education secretary said it demonstrated the necessity of raising tuition fees in England.",
      "The report found that 117 of 270 higher education institutions (43%) registered with the OfS expected to be in deficit by the end of July - despite course closures, job losses and selling off assets.",
      "This third consecutive year of worsening finances was mainly driven by a fall in international student numbers, it said, particularly following visa changes in January 2024.",
      "The number of international students was almost 16% lower last year than previously expected, according to the report.",
      "Universities have become increasingly reliant on higher fees from international students in recent years, as tuition fees from UK students have not kept up with inflation.",
      "Their financial plans predict that more than half of the growth in their tuition fee income up to 2028 will come from international students - but the OfS warned that this was optimistic.",
      "Susan Lapworth, chief executive of the OfS, told the BBC it was \"not currently expecting any large or medium institutions to fail over the next 12 months or so\".",
      "She said: \"Many institutions are financially secure or taking sensible steps to ensure that they're financially secure, so I wouldn't want students to be unduly concerned about these issues.\"",
      "But she went on to say that the OfS was working with a small number of institutions that were \"under real pressure\", including ensuring they drew up plans to protect students in the event that they were forced to close.",
      "Ms Lapworth said OfS was \"constantly thinking\" about when students might need to be told about the situation at those institutions, explaining: \"We know that if the regulator says 'we're working with a particular university', the risk is that its financial failure is then precipitated by simply saying that.\"",
      "The OfS has also said that any student going to university this autumn should expect the course to be delivered as advertised.",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "Everything you need to know about student loans",
      "University tuition fees rising to \u00a39,535 in England",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the figures were \"concerning\" and demonstrated why raising tuition fees in England from this autumn was necessary.",
      "\"Further reforms are needed to fix the foundations of higher education, and universities must do more to make their finances work,\" she added.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of UUK, which represents 141 institutions, said the report was \"deeply sobering\" but not surprising given frozen domestic tuition fees, visa changes and \"a longstanding failure of research grants to cover costs\".",
      "She said universities were doing \"everything they can\" to manage costs and that a UUK sector-wide taskforce would \"unlock greater efficiencies\".",
      "But she added: \"The scale of the challenge means none of this will be enough without government on the pitch too.\"",
      "Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said universities were \"under severe financial stress\".",
      "\"Over 10,000 jobs are already set to disappear from the sector as vice-chancellors attempt to bin courses and cut student provision to the bone,\" she said.",
      "She added that university staff would gather in London on Saturday, calling on the government and university leaders to \"protect higher education, one of our last world-leading sectors\".",
      "University cash crisis to get worse despite tuition fee rise, BBC told",
      "Why tuition fees are set to rise - and what this means for students",
      "'My university course made me who I am - now it's being cut'",
      "A recent snapshot of the financial decisions of 60 of the 141 institutions in UUK found that almost half of those responding had closed courses or reduced options for students in the last three years.",
      "Industrial disputes are under way in several cities as a result.",
      "Universities are now anxiously awaiting the government's draft plan for managing immigration,  which is expected to further limit visas for students applying from Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.",
      "Attracting international students who pay higher fees and spend money in the UK is counted as an export.  The rule change in January 2024 prevented postgraduate students from bringing relatives, and has led to a drop in numbers applying.",
      "The higher fees paid by international students have been used to prop up university finances after many years in which tuition fees for students in England have barely increased.",
      "While fees are due to go up this autumn to \u00a39,535 for students in England,  ministers have yet to say what will happen in following years.",
      "The government is carrying out a review of university education, including funding, which is due to report this summer.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 23:31:16 GMT",
    "summary": "After being dismissed as \"indie landfill\", many guitar bands are back with a vengeance after 20 years.",
    "story": [
      "\"I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself.\"",
      "Luke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer.",
      "Both admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur.",
      "\"But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,\" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie.",
      "\"It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other.\"",
      "The Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom \u2013 a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump.",
      "Over the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts.",
      "Angular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day.",
      "By 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkeys' incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out.",
      "But the party couldn't last forever.",
      "In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves.",
      "Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"?",
      "Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal).",
      "\"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer.",
      "\"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\"",
      "\"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\"",
      "In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld.",
      "But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes.",
      "\"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer.",
      "The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album.",
      "The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences.",
      "But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Na\u00efve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok.",
      "Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience.",
      "How do they explain this sudden revival?",
      "\"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes.",
      "\"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\"",
      "But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse.",
      "\"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff.",
      "\"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\"",
      "Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\".",
      "But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs.",
      "\"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer.",
      "A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry.",
      "The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 \u2013 making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies.",
      "Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up.",
      "The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise.",
      "\"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer.",
      "\"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\"",
      "Are there any reviews seared into their memories?",
      "\"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\"",
      "\"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\"",
      "While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music.",
      "\"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\"",
      "\"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests.",
      "\"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\"",
      "But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman.",
      "Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world.",
      "\"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\"",
      "\"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now.",
      "\"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\"",
      "With hindsight, both men emerged from the 2000s relatively unscathed, and share a newfound appreciation for their early records.",
      "Pritchard, in particular, is revisiting the breathless pop of The Kooks' first two albums on their new record Never/Know, released this week.",
      "\"I felt like I slightly lost my identity [because] I'd been collaborating with outside producers so much,\" he says.",
      "\"So I went back and played all the records we were listening to when we started -  not to repeat ourselves, but to get a firm hand on the identity again.\"",
      "The result is an album that's perfectly timed for summer road trips and sun-soaked festival sets, replete with buoyant melodies and timeless guitar grooves.",
      "Archer is in a similar place, with a new album inspired by a CD-Rom of old demos an ex-girlfriend sent to him last year.",
      "So, have the bands got a five-year plan?",
      "\"Definitely - but it's locked up in my safe,\" laughs Pritchard. \"I think it's good to have goals!\"",
      "\"Do you really?\" asks Archer, with a concerned frown.",
      "\"I literally don't know what I'm going to have for lunch.\""

      "Thomas first appeared on ITV before moving to Cartoon Network, Nick Jr, Channel 5 and can now be found on Netflix.",
      "McCue attributes the show's enduring popularity to its evolution over time while maintaining themes of friendship and teamwork, aligned with its trustworthiness for parents.",
      "\"Over the years, it's built up this amazing fandom, but we keep thinking about our next generation of Thomas fans, and keep it relevant for today,\" he said.",
      "\"But we always remember the themes, the messages of friendship and teamwork and communication, and just make sure they're just fun, wholesome adventures and it's a trusted show.",
      "\"I think parents actually enjoy the fact that they could leave their children to watch Thomas without any concern.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 11:14:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday, life followed fiction when 133 cardinals began the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave takes place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican knew the outcome until a plume of white smoke curled from its chimney on Thursday, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church had a new leader. That man was Cardinal Robert Prevost, now known as Pope Leo XIV.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave operates, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "What is behind the new Pope's chosen name, Leo?",
      "Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?",
      "Pope Leo XIV marks new beginning for Catholic Church",
      "What Pope's speedy election says about Church's priorities",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants would have been \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the most recent election was one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote had been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis' appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This added a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision of who would succeed Pope Francis.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 17:06:21 GMT",
    "summary": "As Trump turns his attention to what he calls the \"dying\" US film industry, his solution has provoked strong reactions.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if \"they're happy\" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry.",
      "So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business, including the UK?",
      "Is Hollywood 'dying'?",
      "Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it?",
      "It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years.",
      "The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing.",
      "Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses.",
      "Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes.",
      "Then the wildfires struck earlier this year.",
      "And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far.",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season.",
      "But Hollywood is definitely still up against it.",
      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\".",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA.",
      "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.",
      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",

    "summary": "After pushing the much-anticipated sequel into 2026, developer Rockstar gives fans a new glimpse of the game.",
    "story": [
      "Just when you'd come to terms with the fact that Grand Theft Auto 6 had been delayed until next year, Rockstar Games goes and drops a brand new trailer.",
      "Last week, the video game developer announced the game had been pushed back to May 2026, shocking fans who were expecting it to land this autumn.",
      "It's been 12 years since the last GTA game was released, and the long wait for the most anticipated sequel of all time just became even more agonising.",
      "But earlier, the company released a new, three-minute trailer, giving eager players a stack of new information to dissect in the meantime.",
      "Here are some of the highlights.",
      "The record-breaking first trailer for GTA 6, published online in late 2023, introduced players to protagonists Jason and Lucia -  a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida, the fictional US state where the game is set.",
      "We now know a bit more about their backstory.",
      "The new trailer opens with Jason doing odd jobs before driving around Vice City - the Miami-inspired location from the 2002 PlayStation 2 game.",
      "According to Rockstar, Jason was a troubled teen who joined the army to escape his bad influences, but fell back into crime after returning home.",
      "In the trailer he eventually collects Lucia from prison, where she has been serving time for \"protecting her family\".",
      "From there, the clip launches into a montage of action sequences, romantic scenes and glimpses of the game's wider world.",
      "We see the couple carrying out armed heists, partying on a yacht and riding a jetski together.",
      "According to a description on Rockstar's website, the two want to forge a new life together but are plunged into \"the middle of a conspiracy\" after an \"easy score goes wrong\".",
      "New characters revealed",
      "Players also got to put names to faces of some of game's wider cast, including bank robber Raul Bautista, smuggler Brian Heder and rap combo Real Dimez.",
      "Like GTA 5, which was heavily based on Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, the sequel also appears to contain accurate recreations of some of Florida's most famous landmarks.",
      "Vice City's version of Miami's art deco, neon-lit beachfront appears in the trailer, as does the Grassrivers swampland, inspired by the Florida everglades.",
      "Rockstar also revealed the Leonida Keys, the industrial Ambrosia region, sleazy Port Gellhorn and the mountainous Kalaga National Park.",
      "In each case, it suggested the areas would be home to different groups and factions, from \"hillbilly mystics\" to biker gangs.",
      "The trailer did not appear to include any gameplay footage, but was made up of cinematic sequences usually seen between story missions.",
      "But fans were quick to praise the game's next-generation graphics in the trailer and a series of screenshots published by Rockstar.",
      "Video game trailers are sometimes created using powerful PCs but a note at the end of the trailer said the scenes in it were taken from a PlayStation 5 console.",
      "But that doesn't answer questions about new ways of interacting with the game's world, or whether players can switch between characters on-the-fly as they could in GTA 5.",
      "Why has GTA 6 taken so long?",
      "The hype around GTA 6 is huge, and Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism.",
      "When it announced the delay last week it told fans it needed extra time to \"deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve\".",
      "According to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, the delay was to also to avoid \"crunch\" - a gaming industry term for enforced overtime.",
      "The company was previously criticised by some staff over the practice - it accepted that some worked \"long hours\" but said some accounts were exaggerated.",

      "The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.",
      "It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "'Infected blood has ruined my life for 40 years'",
      "\"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said.",
      "\"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\"",
      "A final report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time.",
      "The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up.",
      "Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed.",
      "The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside \u00a311.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members, but the latest figures show less than 1% of that total, some \u00a397m, has been paid out to date.",
      "Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years.",

      "Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\"",
      "\"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added.",
      "Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate.",
      "But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal \u2013 a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example \u2013 for the separate impact on their lives.",
      "And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on.",
      "In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\".",
      "The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards.",
      "\"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said.",

      "A former health ombudsman has condemned mental health services for their handling of two vulnerable young men who died in their care.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens, who was parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO) from 2017 to 2024, spoke at the Lampard Inquiry, which is examining the deaths of more than 2,000 people under mental health services in Essex over a 24-year period.",
      "Sir Rob said it was \"a disgrace\" how Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) had failed in its care of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy, who died in 2012, and a 20-year-old man referred to as Mr R, who died in 2008.",
      "\"This was the National Health Service at its worst and needed calling out,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "'Near-complete failure'",
      "Sir Rob referred in his inquiry appearance to several reports made during his tenure, including \"Missed Opportunities\", which looked into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr Leahy and Mr R.",
      "Mr Leahy was found unresponsive at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford. He reported being raped there just days before he died.",
      "Sir Rob told the inquiry the PHSO identified \"19 instances of maladministration\" in Mr Leahy's case by North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust - a predecessor to EPUT - including that his care plan was falsified.",
      "The former ombudsman said there had been \"a near-complete failure of the leadership of this trust, certainly before it was merged\" with South Essex Partnership Trust to become EPUT.",
      "\"This was an indictment of the health service,\" he added.",
      "Sir Rob paid tribute to Matthew's mother, Melanie Leahy, who campaigned for more than a decade for a public inquiry, calling her \"an exemplary complainant\".",

      "Mr R was found unresponsive in the Linden Centre in December 2008 and died afterwards. Sir Rob Behrens found he had been failed multiple times by those treating him.",
      "\"Some clinicians were interviewed after he died, and they had a very patronising approach to him\" he told the inquiry.",
      "\"In their view, [Mr R] didn't have mental health problems at all, and he had been admitted because he wanted somewhere to live because he was homeless. That is staggering.\"",
      "'No confidence'",
      "In a report called \"Broken Trust\", published in 2023, Sir Rob referenced there were more than a dozen different health and care regulators playing important roles in patient safety.",
      "\"Political leaders have created a confusing landscapes of organisations, often in knee-jerk reaction to patient safety crisis points,\" the report said.",
      "Sir Rob agreed with a suggestion put to him by Nicholas Griffin KC, chief counsel to the inquiry, that some incidents \"fall through the gaps\" due to the complexity of the complaints process and therefore are not investigated.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who simply don't know where to go,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "\"At the moment, I have no confidence that people trust the system because they don't know where to go when they want to make a complaint.\"",
      "Sir Rob said that Essex was \"not exceptional\" and the issues he had discovered there could be seen in other places as well.",
      "\"The absence of leadership\u2026 not communicating effectively with patients, the safety issues around ligature points\u2026 and the absence of training and development - these are still issues which the NHS has to address generally, not just in Essex,\" he said.",
      "The former ombudsman also told the inquiry that he was prevented from investigating a significant number of deaths\u00a0due to a \"serious limitation\" in his office's powers.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens explained the ombudsman could only investigate following a complaint, but that for understandable reasons of bereavement or trauma, many families in Essex did not complain following the deaths of loved ones.",

      "The \"big baby\" trial aimed to find out if starting labour earlier than 38 weeks made it less likely for infants who appeared large in the womb to be born with shoulder dystocia, where the shoulder becomes stuck during delivery.",
      "Study findings from between 2018 and 2022 showed giving birth a week to 10 days earlier reduced the risk, researchers said.",

      "The NHS says the condition occurs more often in bigger babies but there is uncertainty over how often.",
      "It is estimated it could affect 1 in 25 women with a big baby who have a vaginal delivery.",

      "Prof Quenby said the trial findings empowered women to decide \"how and when they want to deliver their baby\".",
      "Trial data crucially revealed babies did not suffer more harm if they were delivered later. It also showed earlier delivery reduced the need for emergency Caesarean section and did not increase the risk of tearing.",
      "\"Whether you're induced at 38 weeks or whether you choose to wait for a natural labour, in both groups the baby's outcomes were the same,\" Prof Quenby said.",
      "\"Both groups had a risk of shoulder dystocia, it was actually slightly higher if you waited for labour naturally - but babies didn't do any worse if you wait for labour naturally.\"",

    "story": [
      "The number of assisted deaths could be more than 4,000 in the 10th year after the law comes into force in England and Wales if MPs vote for it, a review of the policy says.",
      "The estimate forms part of the official impact assessment, carried out by civil servants to inform MPs as they debate whether to allow assisted dying.",
      "It said initially the numbers coming forward would be low, but are expected to grow over time.",
      "The impact assessment says that the total number of assisted deaths is estimated to range from between 164 and 787 in the first (half) year of the service to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, and assuming a start date to the policy of October 2029.",
      "The upper estimate  of just over 4,500 assisted deaths would still only represent less than 1% of all deaths, the document said.",
      "The impact assessment also provides a financial analysis of the costs and savings involved \u2013 it is not a document that gets into the ethical or philosophical arguments for and against the policy.",
      "It comes as the bill returns to the House of Commons later this month, with a crucial vote that will determine whether the bill becomes law expected to happen in mid June.",
      "Costs and savings",
      "In the first six months, savings for the NHS could range from around \u00a3919,000 to \u00a310.3m.",
      "This figure includes hospital care, primary and community care, hospice, medicines and other care costs that someone choosing an assisted death would not need.",
      "By the time the system has been running for ten years, savings could range from \u00a35.84m to \u00a359.6m.",
      "But there will be costs too. Staffing an assisted dying service could cost in excess of \u00a310m a year within a decade. And training costs in the first six months alone could be over \u00a311m.",
      "One assisted death would likely involve six health and care professionals working 32 hours.",
      "It said this could take staff away from existing services, but the overall impact of this was uncertain.",
      "And each panel that would review cases, comprising of a lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker, could cost \u00a32,000 a day.",
      "Overall, it said it was not possible to calculate whether the costs outweighed the savings or vice versa as there were too many uncertainties.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said the government was neutral on the issue. It said the document had been produce to help ensure any legislation that passes through parliament is \"workable, effective and enforceable\".",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP behind the bill, said she was grateful for the work that had been done on the impact assessment.",
      "She said she was still \"firmly of the view that the overall impact of this long overdue reform will be to make end of life care in England and Wales more compassionate and significantly safer\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"For me, assisted dying and giving people a choice at the end of their life when they are facing a terminal illness is about the human cost, it's not about pounds and pence.\"",
      "But Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, a former Paralympian and member of the House of Lords, who opposes assisted dying, said: \"This assessment highlights how assisted dying would put disabled and other vulnerable people at grave risk by providing financial incentives to an already overburdened and under-resourced NHS to offer assisted dying as a 'treatment option'.\"",
      "Leadbeater told Today the eligibility criteria under the bill was \"extremely strict\".",
      "She said: \"You have to be terminally ill. There are multiple layers of safeguarding built into the bill, including a multi-disciplinary panel of experts.",
      "\"So we are assessing mental capacity, we are checking for coercion at every level of this process to make sure that this is the clear and settled informed wish of the person who is terminally ill.\"",
      "She said that the bill was \"only about terminally ill adults who have less than six months to live\". \"The bill does not cover people with disabilities,\" she added.",
      "Prof Katherine Sleeman, professor of palliative care at King's College London, said the cost of end of life care was \"very, very high\", adding \"obviously if someone is not living those last months of life then it's lower\".",
      "However, she cautioned that the figures in the assessment were estimates."

      "Campaigners say haemophiliacs could have been offered an alternative treatment called Cryoprecipitate. This was much harder to administer, but was made from the blood plasma of a single donor, lowering the infection risk.",
      "BBC News has also uncovered evidence children were infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being placed on clinical trials of new treatments - often, without their family's consent.",

      "There are biological reasons too that make emotional health problems more likely, says Prof Andrea Danese, an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London.",
      "\"Teenagers' brains don't develop all at once. The part that processes emotions matures earlier than the part responsible for self-control and good judgement.

      "\"It's important to avoid the trap of providing unnecessary reassurance,\" Prof Danese says. Instead, alongside teaching calming techniques, parents should discuss and test out feared situations. \"To reduce worries, it can help to write them down or talk about them at a special 'worry time' once a day.\"",

We get lots of calls from parents in that position. When they see their child struggling it can make them question themselves and they just don't know where to turn.",

    "summary": "Why is the number of autism diagnoses changing? And what does it mean for autistic people?",
    "story": [
      "You might have seen the social media videos: the \"five signs you're autistic\". You may have heard about long waiting lists for autism diagnosis. You might know, or sense, that the numbers of people deemed autistic are going up, fast.",
      "There's a lot at stake. These numbers mean fiercely different things to different people. To some, autism is a fear (what if this happens to my child?); to others it's an identity, maybe even a superpower.",
      "So what's the truth about the number of autistic people - and what does it mean?",
      "To count something, you first need to say what it is you're counting.",
      "For someone to be diagnosed with autism, they need to have \"persistent difficulties in social life and in social communication,\" says Ginny Russell, an associate professor in psychiatry at University College London (UCL) and the author of The Rise of Autism. She's using the criteria for autism from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, known as the DSM.",
      "She says examples of this behaviour can range from a lack of turn-taking in conversation to being completely non-verbal.",
      "Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours are part of a second group of traits required to meet the criteria, she says. So things like \"hand flapping or rocking or skin picking, but also sticking to repeated routines, like eating the same food every day.\"",
      "The data",
      "But what evidence is there that the number of people meeting those criteria has risen?",
      "Ms Russell led a study that looked at changes in rates of autism diagnosis in the UK over 20 years. It drew on a big sample of data from about nine million patients who were registered at GP surgeries.",
      "They found eight times as many new autism diagnoses in 2018 as in 1998. \"It was an enormous increase,\" she says, \"best described as exponential.\"",
      "And it's not just happening in the UK. Though data is lacking in much of the world, Ms Russell says that \"in the Anglophone and European countries where we do have data, there is compelling evidence to suggest that other countries have seen a similar sort of rise in diagnosis as in the UK\".",
      "But - and this is a crucial point - a rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism is not the same thing as a rise in the number of people who are autistic.",
      "Ms Russell's study and others like it show there has been a huge rise in the number of people diagnosed with autism, so in that sense there is more autism around than there used to be. But could that rise in diagnosis be explained by changes to who we count as autistic rather than an increase in the number of autistic people?",
      "Why are diagnoses rising?",
      "The definition of autism has not been static. The first studies to describe autism appeared in the 1930s and 1940s, says Francesca Happ\u00e9, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London, who's been researching autism since 1988.",
      "\"The original descriptions of autism are of children who have pretty high support needs, typically are very late to talk,\" she says. \"Some don't talk at all. And the focus really was on children, of course, and largely on males.\"",
      "But the definition was broadened, Prof Happ\u00e9 says, when in the 1990s Asperger's syndrome was added to diagnostic manuals. People with Asperger's were seen as on the autistic spectrum because of social difficulties and repetitive behaviour, but had fluent language and good intelligence, she says.",
      "The eightfold increase in new diagnoses that Ginny Russell found included Asperger's syndrome, which was seen as a particular type of autism.",
      "Another subset of autism added to the manuals was a \"safety net diagnosis\" called \"pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\" (PDD-NOS) and that increased the numbers too.",
      "Today, diagnostic manuals refer simply to autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, which includes people previously diagnosed with Asperger's or PDD-NOS.",
      "The autism net has been cast wider.",
      "Autism in women and girls",
      "One group of people now falling under this net more often is women and girls.",
      "Studies looking at the huge rise in autism diagnoses show that the rise has been considerably faster for females than for males.",
      "It's something Sarah Hendrickx has seen in her job as part of a team that diagnoses autism.",
      "\"I've been doing this maybe 15, 20 years or so,\" she says. \"In the early days, they were virtually all males that were coming forward for diagnosis. And now they're nearly all females who I see.\"",
      "Ms Hendrickx was herself diagnosed with autism as an adult and is also the author of a book called Women and Girls on the Autism Spectrum.",
      "She says the big growth in the number of people diagnosed with autism is because we're\u202f\"playing catch-up for decades and decades of people like myself\".",
      "Because autism was originally seen as something that affected mainly boys, she says autistic girls would instead be diagnosed with mental health conditions like social anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD).",
      "Now we have a better understanding of how autism can present in girls and women, thanks to an increase in research and books like Ms Hendrickx's, which was first published in 2014.",
      "She says that one important gender difference is that girls may be better at masking, which means hiding their autistic traits so that they fit in socially, perhaps by copying others' behaviour.",
      "More adults diagnosed",
      "The rise in diagnosis has also been much faster among adults than children. Ms Hendrickx says this shows another way the autism net has been cast wider: it now includes more people with lower support needs.",
      "\"We are talking, I think, more about individuals with no intellectual disability,\" she says. \"I think people with delays in their development, in their speech, are much more likely to have been diagnosed much, much earlier because the signs were much clearer at a very young age.\"",
      "There's data to back this up. One study shows that between 2000 and 2018, new autism diagnoses of those with intellectual disability rose about 20%, while autism diagnoses in those without intellectual disability rose 700%. Autism's centre of gravity has shifted.",
      "For Ellie Middleton, an autistic and ADHD content creator and author, that's a good thing.",
      "The 27-year-old says that sceptics questioning the increase in diagnoses should instead be asking: \"how did all of these people spend so much of their life undiagnosed, unsupported and let down?\"",
      "She says she became very mentally unwell before being diagnosed with autism. \"I was on the maximum dose of antidepressants that any fully grown adult could be on at the age of 17,\" she says. \"I couldn't be left alone, I couldn't go out.\"",
      "Her autism diagnosis three years ago helped her to change the way she lives her life and to keep her mental health in a better place.",
      "But others worry that the version of autism people now see in the media and in their social media feeds is distorting public perceptions.",
      "A focus on celebrities can \"glamorise\" autism, says Venessa Swaby, who is also autistic and runs support groups for autistic children and their parents through her organisation A2ndvoice. Meanwhile, she says, families with non-speaking autistic children feel they are \"written off\".",
      "As the number of people diagnosed with autism has risen, so then has the diversity of autistic people, which, in turn, has brought tensions over who owns the word - and what it means.",
      "Environmental causes",
      "There's also been a looping effect: as more people are diagnosed with autism, more people become aware of it and that fuels the rise in numbers further.",
      "The internet and social media have played a big part in that - as well as speculation about the reasons behind the rapid rise in diagnoses.",
      "Disproven theories linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination to autism linger. Others say there must be something in what we eat, drink, or breathe that's causing more autism.",
      "But, as we've seen, the data suggest the rise in diagnoses can be explained by a broadening autism definition rather than an increase in the amount of underlying autism. And there's solid research showing that autism is largely a product of the genes you inherit from your parents.",
      "Is there any evidence that environmental causes could be playing some part in the rise, even if a small one?",
      "Ginny Russell looked at research into different potential environmental factors and found only a few that were plausible to explain some of the rise.",
      "\"There is definitely a quite well established link between autism and the age of the parent,\" she says. \"If the parent is older you're more likely to have an autistic child, but it's not a huge effect.\"",
      "She also says that there's some evidence around \"preterm birth and infection during pregnancy and also some birth complications\".",
      "But Ms Russell says it's important to put those possible factors into perspective.",
      "\"I honestly believe that the vast majority of the increase is due to what I would call a diagnostic culture,\" she says. \"Our conception of the condition has changed, and that's meant that there's been an increase.\"",

    "story": [
      "The prime minister has said there are \"ongoing discussions\" with the United States over digital services, following the deal struck with President Trump.",
      "The UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) - a 2% levy which raises about \u00a3800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was widely thought to be part of trade talks with the US.",
      "On Thursday, the government announced the DST remains \"undisturbed and unchanged\" as part of the US-UK deal slashing tariffs imposed by President Trump on cars and metals.",
      "Asked if he could guarantee that there would not be any changes to the DST, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"On digital services, there are ongoing discussions and various other aspects of the deal.\"",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "US agreement leaves the UK open to do a much more significant EU deal",
      "Chris Mason: Starmer can claim limited win with America deal",
      "Speaking to broadcasters on board HMS St Albans during a visit to Norway, Sir Keir said the deal reached with the US this week \"predominantly focused on steel and aluminium and reducing those tariffs on car manufacturing and reducing the tariffs there\".",
      "\"On digital services, there are ongoing discussions, obviously, on other aspects of the deal, but the important thing to focus on yesterday is the sectors that are now protected that the day before yesterday were very exposed,\" he added.",
      "While the new deal offers some relief to industries affected by the tariffs announced by President Trump, the government is continuing to work on a wider UK-US trade agreement.",
      "One point of tension has been the DST, which affects large multinational enterprises who run social media services, online search engines or an online marketplace for UK consumers.",
      "It is a 2% tax on companies with revenues of more than \u00a3500m worldwide and \u00a325m in the UK, affecting global tech giants like Amazon and Meta.",
      "It was introduced by the previous Conservative government in 2020.",
      "President Trump has made clear his distaste for what he sees as unfair taxes targeting American firms.",
      "Previously, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said the government had to \"get the balance right\" on negotiating with the US.",
      "Speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg she said it was the \"right thing that companies who operate in the UK pay their taxes in the UK, and the US government and tech companies understand as well, but we are having discussions with the US at the moment. I want to preserve free and open trade.\"",
      "Potential changes to the DST have been criticised by the Liberal Democrats, who have previously said Labour is \"at risk of losing its moral compass\" if it cuts the tax.",
      "But on Thursday, Trade Minister Douglas Alexander told MPs the government had \"listened carefully\" to concerns about weakening online harm protections in trade talks.",
      "He added the government had \"worked hard to advance the UK's national interest in the agreement that is reached\".",
      "Asked about the deal on Friday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the deal was \"better than nothing but it's not much\".",
      "\"One of the things that concerns me is that we will probably now not get a comprehensive free trade agreement. It looks like Labour has settled,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A group of MPs urge the PM to delay any decisions until impact assessments of the changes are published.",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing a growing rebellion by Labour MPs over planned welfare cuts some have warned are \"impossible to support\" without a \"change of direction\".",
      "In a letter to The Guardian, 42 MPs said proposed welfare savings worth \u00a35bn a year by 2030 had \"caused a huge amount of anxiety and concern among disabled people and their families\".",
      "The MPs urged ministers to delay any decisions until assessments of the potential impact of the cuts on employment and health had been published.",
      "A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) source said a \"determination to help more people into work\" was at the heart of the benefits changes.",
      "\"We understand that there are concerns,\" the DWP source added.",
      "\"The secretary of state is engaging and talking to colleagues, explaining why these reforms will help transform people's lives.\"",
      "The letter comes before MPs are expected to vote on a new law that would bring the benefits cuts into effect next month.",
      "On Wednesday, nine Labour MPs spoke during a debate to say they would vote against the changes to a key disability benefit called personal independence payment (Pip) and universal credit (UC).",
      "In Labour's ranks of MPs there has been growing disquiet over the welfare reforms since the party suffered heavy losses in last week's local elections.",
      "In the letter, the 42 MPs said the planned cuts \"represent the biggest attack on the welfare state since George Osborne ushered in the years of austerity and over three million of our poorest and most disadvantaged will be affected\".",
      "It continued: \"Whilst the government may have correctly diagnosed the problem of a broken benefits system and a lack of job opportunities for those who are able to work, they have come up with the wrong medicine. Cuts don't create jobs, they just cause more hardship.\"",
      "The letter said the benefits system does need reform to tackle \"the barriers that disabled people face when trying to find and maintain employment\".",
      "\"Without a change in direction, the green paper will be impossible to support,\" it added.",
      "Letters to PM",
      "In March, the government released a green paper to spell out the details of its proposed shake-up of the benefits system.",
      "Overall, the government spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "The government estimated that 3.2 million families could be worse off as a result of the reforms, while 3.8 million families will be better off by 2030.",
      "MPs will get a chance to vote on the plans because the government needs to pass primary legislation to make the changes to welfare payments.",
      "The legislation is due to be published this month before making its way through Parliament in June.",
      "The BBC understands some of the signatories are also writing to the prime minister to press for a delay in the vote until the full impact assessment on health and employment is published.",
      "Alongside the welfare cuts, the government has put forward proposals to encourage more people receiving benefits to find work.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was unable to say how effective those employment measures would be when it published its assessment of the green paper, citing a lack of detail from the government.",
      "Instead, the OBR plans to include an assessment of this element of the welfare changes in its autumn forecast.",
      "On Wednesday, Disability Minister Sir Stephen Timms defended the proposals, saying it was not sustainable for welfare spending to rise at the current rate.",
      "\"The current system produces poor employment outcomes, high economic inactivity, low living standards, high costs to the taxpayer. It needs to change,\" he said.",
      "\"We want a more proactive, pro-work system that supports people better and supports the economy as well.\"",
      "The BBC has been told some potential rebels are being assured they won't lose the party whip if they abstain \u2013 or make themselves scarce \u2013 when the vote comes.",
      "The government is not at risk of defeat, given Labour has a large majority, but a sizable rebellion could show the extent of the discontent within the party.",

    "story": [
      "Home working appears to have led to a bigger decline in after-work drinking in city centres outside London, a Lords committee has heard.",
      "Urban economist Paul Swinney told peers that pub spending data suggested that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday.",
      "But a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, he added, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend.",
      "He also added that a decline in city-centre spending had not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centres.",
      "Could Thursday be 'the new Friday' for Londoners?",
      "Homeworkers get 24 more minutes of sleep a day",
      "Mr Swinney, director of the Centre for Cities think tank, was among various experts giving evidence to a special House of Lords committee set up earlier this year to examine the impact of remote and hybrid working in the UK.",
      "Last month, the think tank published research on the pre and post-pandemic spending patterns of city-centre workers in pubs and bars around their places of work, by comparing credit and debit card data from 2019 and 2024.",
      "The analysis showed that during that period, the share of weekly spending in pubs in central London on Fridays fell, whilst on Thursdays it rose, making it the most most popular night of the week.",
      "But a similar pattern was not seen in the data for nine other large British cities, including Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Newcastle and Sheffield.",
      "Surveys have shown Friday has become the most popular day for office workers to work from home, with attendance during the middle of the week returning to more similar levels to before the Covid pandemic.",
      "'Shift to weekend'",
      "Explaining the spending data to peers on Thursday, Mr Swinney said that in London \"the Friday night drink hasn't so much gone away, it's just shifted to a Thursday\".",
      "\"But when we looked at other large cities, that wasn't the case,\" he added.",
      "\"It appeared from the data that we have that the post-work drink has reduced in those other places.",
      "\"Actually the shift seems to go into the weekend, which seems to be workers coming in from a leisure perspective, rather than going out after work\".",
      "The data analysed by the Centre for Cities showed that 32% of weekly pub spending in big cities outside London now takes place on a Saturday, suggesting workers are more likely to return on weekends to socialise than in the capital.",
      "Supermarket spending",
      "Elsewhere in the session, Mr Swinney said a decline in city-centre spending since the rise in remote and hybrid working had not been matched by an equivalent rise in spending on \"local High Streets\".",
      "\"That might have happened a little bit, but certainly not to the extent that people were suggesting [during the pandemic],\" he told the committee.",
      "He added that suburban supermarkets had \"probably been the biggest winner\" from the shift in spending patterns since Covid.",
      "He said more flexible working patterns had led to some immediate benefits for workers, including reduced travel cost and more flexibility.",
      "But he added it could be \"two, three, ten years down the line\" before the long-term impact on economic productivity could be properly assessed.",

    "story": [
      "The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, as part of a new agreement between the US and UK.",
      "The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January.",
      "But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK.",
      "Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year.",
      "No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details.",
      "Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\".",
      "\"This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,\" he said, adding that the \"the UK has no greater ally than the United States\".",
      "At the White House, Trump called it a \"great deal\" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance.",
      "\"This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,\" he said.",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "US agreement leaves the UK open to do a much more significant EU deal",
      "What's in the deal?",
      "The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year.",
      "That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs.",
      "\"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\"",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously.",
      "The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative.",
      "The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.",
      "Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products.",
      "\"It can't be understated how important this deal is,\" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said.",
      "What's the reaction?",
      "UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer \"major relief\" to the steel sector.",
      "\"The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,\" he said.",
      "Other business groups expressed more uncertainty.",
      "\"It's better\u00a0than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,\" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade.",
      "\"I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit.\"",
      "While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.",
      "\"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say.",
      "Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail.",
      "\"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\"",
      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development.",
      "\"The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,\" he said. \"It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.\"",
      "Win for US ranchers?",
      "The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time.",
      "But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK.",
      "It was not clear how much those issues had advanced.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a \"tremendous win\" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes.",
      "The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports.",
      "While the UK appears to have made some commitments, \"the devil will be in the details,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement.",
      "Other issues loom.",
      "Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines.",
      "The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms \"preferential treatment\".",
      "But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now \"left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean\"."

      "But the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has admitted the figures are not completely accurate and are instead an \"experimental\" statistic - which has previously led to the systematic underestimating of EU migrants and overestimating of others.",
      "New rules introduced by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a bid to reduce migration levels are thought to have contributed to the latest fall in numbers.",
      "Since April 2024, those apply for a visa have needed a job offer with a salary at least \u00a338,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous \u00a326,200 minimum.",
      "The threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales.",
      "During an evidence session of the Public Accounts Committee, Marc Owen, the director for visa status said his team \"were not tracking every single individual\" working in the UK.",
      "Pressed by Betts at the committee, Mr Owen said the government \"can only know\" if someone has left the country by matching airline passenger data with visa records.",
      "Instead of tracking exits, the Home Office relies on employers carrying out visa checks and enforcement squads to catch those overstaying their visas.",
      "\"We use our immigration enforcement services to visit illegal working places on the basis of intelligence and to collect people and to return them as they can,\" he said.",
      "Home Office Permanent Secretary Dame Antonia Romeo said overstaying is \"a problem\" the department is now \"fixing,\" with support from HMRC and local councils.",
      "\"We're not saying it's been solved,\" she said. \"We are identifying the issues and putting in place fixes.\"",
      "The Home Office were also working to modernise border security and boost digital checks, Mr Owen said.",
      "Currently the Home Office do not know who is \"here or not, that is the reality\", Betts said.",
      "Visa holders who have not \"gone through your systems they just disappear and they're in the black economy,\" he warned.",

    "story": [
      "Prisons minister James Timpson has told the BBC more criminals could be tagged in future instead of being sent to prison - but insists he's not \"soft on crime\".",
      "More than 30 companies, including Microsoft and Google, will meet the government today to explore how technology could help monitor offenders in the community more effectively and tackle violence in prison.",
      "Lord Timpson says tagging more people instead of sending them to prison is a potential alternative punishment.",
      "But critics have questioned his previous comments about the UK being \"addicted\" to sentencing and punishment, and how \"only a third\" of inmates should be in prison.",
      "\"I don't think I'm soft on crime at all,\" Lord Timpson says in the wide-ranging BBC interview. \"I think I'm pretty tough in my style. In business, I'm tough but I use the evidence - and in this job I'm using the evidence.\"",
      "He says he is passionate about rehabilitating offenders in prison so they don't commit further crimes when released. However, 38.3% of adult criminals in England and Wales go on to reoffend within a year of being let out of prison.",
      "\"How do we reduce re-offending? How do we deal with people's drug addiction, mental health problems, the fact that people leave prison they don't know where to live, people don't have a job? That is also a really important part of my job,\" he says.",
      "How many people are in prison and who is being released early from jail?",
      "The former CEO of the Timpson Group, which provides key cutting and shoe repair services, is known for hiring ex-offenders and is a former chairman of the Prison Reform Trust.",
      "Lord Timpson took up his role at the Ministry of Justice in July last year, when the penal system in England and Wales was close to breaking point. Prisons were full, and months later thousands of inmates were released early as part of an emergency plan to ease overcrowding and free up space.",
      "He says prisons are still in a state of \"crisis\", with fewer than 1,000 spare places and more than 88,000 people in custody in England and Wales.",
      "\"We recently opened HMP Millsike,\" he says, describing the new category C prison which opened in East Yorkshire in March, with capacity for up to 1,500 inmates. \"We've got more cells opening across the country. We need to keep building prison places because the population is going up.\"",
      "Last month, three prison officers were seriously injured at HMP Frankland, in Durham, after they were attacked with makeshift weapons and hot oil by one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing. Hashem Abedi was being held in a separation centre - used to house a small number of the most dangerous and extremist inmates - at the category A, maximum security jail.",
      "\"What happened in Frankland is absolutely shocking,\" Lord Timpson says. \"The level of violence in prisons is far too high - and it is increasing.",
      "\"Our prison staff did an incredible job. I don't want them to turn up to work thinking that there's going to be violence. I want them to turn up to work helping people turn their lives around.\"",
      "However, the number of assaults on staff in prison is the highest in a decade, with 10,605 recorded in 2024.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",

      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "Probation: 'Too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many offenders'",
      "Lord Timpson refutes claims that gangs are in charge of some of Britain's biggest jails, but acknowledges that serious organised crime is the one thing that \"keeps me awake at night\".",
      "\"Serious organised crime brings drugs in and creates violence and intimidation in prisons,\" he says. \"This has been a long-term problem in prisons, but it is even more of a problem when the capacity is as full as it is.",
      "\"If we had people who went to prison who didn't get drugs and weren't intimidated by serious organised criminals, they'd be far more likely to engage with a sentence and get well enough so that when they leave they don't commit further crime.\"",
      "Why Starmer hired key-cutting boss as prisons minister",
      "The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding. The review will provide long-term solutions for the justice system and examine the use and composition of non-custodial sentences, including community alternatives to prison and the use of fines. Increased tagging will also be considered.",
      "The total number of people fitted with an electronic monitoring device in England and Wales on 30 June 2024 was 20,893, an increase of 17% on the previous year.",
      "There are three types of ankle tags currently used to monitor offenders: alcohol, GPS, and curfew tags. A new study suggests tags that monitor curfews cut reoffending by 20%.",
      "\"We want them to have a one-way ticket - not a return back into prison or back into non-custodial sentences,\" Lord Timpson says.",
      "\"What's really important is we embrace technology and look at the evidence - tagging can have some very important benefits.\"",
      "But the use of electronic tagging to monitor offenders has been problematic. In recent months several probation staff have told the BBC offenders who should be tagged, have not been. The security company Serco has been contracted by the government to manage tagging since October 2023.",
      "\"We inherited a contract with Serco and it's been far from perfect,\" Lord Timpson says. \"We're putting a lot of pressure still on them to perform, but we need to work together to make sure that people are tagged on time in the right way. Things are getting better, but we're not there yet.\"",
      "Anthony Kirby, Serco Group CEO, told the BBC he is pleased the prisons minister has recognised the progress Serco has made since taking over the electronic monitoring service: \"We are proud of the role we have supporting the Criminal Justice System, monitoring record numbers of people in the community and protecting public safety in partnership with HMPPS.\"",

      "\"That is to deal with the \u00a322bn black hole that they left. Because of our action, we've stabilised the economy.\"",
      "He also stressed the government was committed to the triple lock, under which pensions go up each year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",
      "Hitting back, Badenoch said: \"The only black hole is the one the prime minister is digging.",
      "\"This issue affects some of the poorest and most vulnerable pensioners. His mayor in Doncaster says it's wrong. His first minister in Wales says it's wrong. Even his own MPs are saying it's wrong. He's refused to listen to me on this, will he at least listen to his own party and change course?\"",
      "In response, Sir Keir said: \"No other party is saying how they would invest in our NHS and public services.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also urged the PM to reverse the cuts, saying this was \"among the messages voters sent ministers last week\".",
      "The winter fuel payment is a lump sum worth between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300, designed to help with higher energy costs during the colder weather.",
      "It was previously paid to all pensioners but last year the government restricted this to only the poorest, who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid save \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move, which did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto, means around nine million pensioners no longer qualify for the payment.",
      "Labour MPs who oppose the cuts believe a reversal of the policy would be a clear sign from the prime minister that he is listening to voters.",
      "However, others closer to government thinking question whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has already been done.",
      "Criticism of changes to disability benefits, which would make it harder for people to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip), could become a more pressing issue, with a vote in the House of Commons likely next month.",

      "The domestic political reaction to this deal has focused on one element of it: an agreement that India workers transferred to the UK and their employers won't have to pay national insurance in the UK in their first three years here.",
      "This, the Conservative leader and former business secretary Kemi Badenoch argued, is \"lop sided\" and why she didn't sign off on the deal when she was in government.",
      "The Liberal Democrats and Reform UK have also criticised this part of the agreement.",
      "British officials acknowledge this is an element of the deal India really wanted, but they argue it is worth it in the round and standard practice in deals like this.",
      "And, strikingly, the Conservative reaction isn't consistent: Sir Oliver Dowden, who sat around the same cabinet table as Kemi Badenoch as deputy prime minister, welcomed it.",
      "There are a few key bits of context to this deal and one final observation I would make.",
      "The context is this: the ongoing turbulence of President Trump's tariffs and the ongoing negotiations with both the United States and the European Union over improving trade deals with both.",
      "Progress on both is expected soon \u2013 a summit with the EU will take place in the UK later this month.",
      "And that one last thing.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer voted against Brexit and campaigned for another referendum in the hope of stopping it.",
      "And yet, in a twist of fate and timing, he is the first post-Brexit British prime minister to have the political space and time to grapple with the tools leaving the EU gave whoever occupies his office, with the trade-offs and arguments that brings.",

    "story": [
      "The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries.",
      "President Donald Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods entering the US.",
      "But the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium.",
      "Here's an at-a-glance look at what's in the deal.",
      "This isn't a trade deal",
      "Trump declared on social media this announcement would be a \"major trade deal\" - it's not.",
      "He does not have the authority to sign the type of free-trade agreement India and the UK finalised earlier this week - this lies with Congress.",
      "Congress would need to approve a trade agreement, which would take longer than the 90-day pause in place on some of Trump's tariffs.",
      "This is an agreement which has reversed or cut some of those tariffs on specific goods.",
      "It is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement, there will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow.",
      "Car tariffs cut to 10%",
      "Trump had placed import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into the US on top of the existing 2.5%.",
      "This has been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, which matches the number of cars the UK exported last year.",
      "But any cars exported above that quota will be subject to a 27.5% import tax.",
      "Cars are the UK's biggest export to the US - worth about \u00a39bn last year.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover, which exports almost a quarter of its cars to the US,  said the deal \"secures greater certainty for our sector\".",
      "But car industry leaders have told the BBC the quota could effectively put a ceiling on the number they can export competitively.",
      "The UK currently imposes a 10% levy on US car imports, but it is not clear if there is any change to this.",
      "The US has previously demanded the tax be cut to 2.5%, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves had indicated she is open to such a cut.",
      "Trump also announced that Rolls-Royce engines and plane parts will be able to be exported from the UK to the US tariff-free.",
      "No tariffs on steel and aluminium",
      "A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US that came into effect in March has been scrapped.",
      "This is good news for firms such as British Steel which was brought under government control as it struggled to stay operational.",
      "However, the White House said it would impose a quota on the \"most favoured nation rates for UK steel and aluminium and certain derivative steel and aluminium products.\"",
      "It is currently unclear how much of these products the UK will be able to export to the US under this quota system without paying more.",
      "It is also unclear whether the scrapping of tariffs will apply to steel derivative products and whether only steel melted and poured in the UK will benefit.",
      "The UK exports a relatively small amount of steel and aluminium to the US, about \u00a3700m in total.",
      "However, the tariffs also cover products made with steel and aluminium, including things such as gym equipment, furniture and machinery.",
      "These are worth much more, about \u00a32.2bn, or about 5% of UK exports to the US last year.",
      "Industry body Steel UK said there were \"a number hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal\".",
      "It said firms needed to know what supply chain conditions need to be met, what the quotas are and when they take effect.",
      "Pharmaceuticals still the big unknown",
      "What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown with the UK saying work would continue on this and the remaining reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The US said both countries would \"promptly negotiate significantly preferential treatment outcomes on pharmaceuticals\".",
      "Pharmaceuticals are a major export for the UK when it comes to US trade \u2013 last year sales of these products were worth \u00a36.6bn making it the UK's second-biggest export to the US.",
      "It's also America's fourth biggest export to the UK, valued at \u00a34bn last year.",

      "There was no change to the UK's 2% digital services tax in this deal and it appears to be a sticking point.",
      "Businesses that run social media, search engines or online marketplaces have to pay it if they receive more than \u00a3500m in global revenues and \u00a325m from UK users annually.",
      "But this threshold is easily met by US tech giants like Meta, Google, Apple.",
      "The UK reportedly netted nearly \u00a3360m from American tech firms via the tax in its first year.",

      "US beef exports to the UK had been subject to a 20% tariff within a quota of 1,000 metric tons. The UK has scrapped this tariff and raised the quota to 13,000 metric tonnes, according to the White House document.",

    "story": [
      "You have to go back more than 100 years, to before 1922, for an election where Labour was not dominating Welsh politics.",
      "Rooted in the industrial heritage of the country which was once the home of the UK's first Labour MP, Keir Hardie, the party has beat all others in Wales in every major Westminster election ever since.",
      "Labour has always been the largest party in Cardiff Bay too, and has won every election for the Welsh Parliament.",
      "But for the first time, the outlook for Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election on May 7 2026 is much less clear.",
      "Led by Eluned Morgan, it faces a fight to hold on to the reins of the Welsh government, and the sway it has held over Welsh politics.",
      "How do you vote in the Senedd election?",
      "What's your Senedd constituency?",
      "What does the Senedd do?",
      "Polls have shown Labour neck and neck with two parties - the pro-independence Plaid Cymru, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "But a survey published this week suggested Plaid Cymru was pulling ahead, with Labour falling behind Farage.",
      "Both Plaid and Reform are hoping they can leapfrog Labour and become the largest group in the Senedd, as are the Welsh Conservatives, who are polling behind the other three.",
      "A new voting system means the next Senedd could be split between about four parties of a similar size, raising questions about exactly how the next Welsh government could be brought together.",
      "A senior Tory has said a coalition in the next parliament is \"nailed on\", and there is talk among some about whether parties would need to share the top job of first minister.",
      "The Welsh Parliament, or Senedd Cymru, is what we now call the institution set up as the National Assembly in 1999.",
      "Whoever can command control of the parliament forms the Welsh government - the ministers which run the services Westminster decided to hand over to Cardiff Bay, including the NHS.",
      "While it has never won a majority, Labour has led every single government since 1999, with the assistance of Plaid and the Lib Dems.",
      "The potential for a shake-up in the Senedd is partly down to plans to expand the number of politicians there from 60 to 96 - the brainchild of former First Minister Mark Drakeford and former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.",
      "As well as more politicians, the new parliament is likely to better reflect the proportion of votes won by each party - more so than the mixed system used up until now.",
      "This is important when it is considered against polls that suggest Welsh voters are divided.",
      "Two recent ones - from Survation and Beaufort Research - have put Labour ahead of Plaid and Reform but only just.",
      "But a poll by ITV Wales and Cardiff University conducted in late April placed Plaid on 30%, with Reform behind on 25% and Labour on 18% - a historic low. The Conservatives were placed at 13%, the Lib Dems 7% and the Greens 5%.",
      "All recent polling for Labour on Senedd voting intention is lower than how the party performed at the last general election, where it got 37% of the vote.",
      "Cardiff University politics expert Prof Richard Wyn Jones said the previous mixed proportional and first-past-the-post system helped Labour win around 50% of the seats in Wales with \"a third of the vote\".",
      "He said elections in both Wales and Scotland next year will be the \"most high-profile test for the Starmer administration\".",
      "\"It would be utterly seismic if they are not the largest party in Wales,\" he told BBC Wales.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones spoke before Tuesday's poll was published - as did everyone else in this article. He said Labour's chances of coming first should not be written off.",
      "\"But even if Labour is only barely ahead, that would be seismic because it would mean the Labour group in the Senedd is essentially not much bigger than the current Labour group in the Senedd, and the Senedd would be 36 seats bigger,\" he said.",
      "So, what could be behind it all?",
      "The post-pandemic period has been tough for Welsh Labour \u2013 plunged into crisis over the donation of \u00a3200,000 from a man convicted of illegally dumping waste to its now-former leader, Vaughan Gething.",
      "The row exposed splits within the Labour group of 30 MSs. Despite Welsh Labour having a landslide general election result, several Welsh ministers resigned to force Gething's ouster, prompting the rise of Morgan as first minister.",
      "Even before Drakeford decided to step down in late 2023, triggering the leadership contest that Gething won, Labour MSs had been arguing over transport policies, including the default 20mph speed limit, while the government has been struggling with long waits in the Welsh NHS.",
      "Former Labour special advisor turned lobbyist Cathy Owens, of Cavendish Cymru, partly blamed the leadership crisis and factors at a UK level.",
      "Or, as she puts it: \"As soon as Labour won power at UK level... everybody realised that Keir Starmer wasn't the most exciting leader we've had and then Labour had to make lots of difficult decisions.\"",
      "'We were lecturing over 20mph'",
      "NHS waits and the controversial 20mph speed limit were always among the top three issues relayed on the doorstep at the general election, according to a well-connected Welsh Labour activist.",
      "They said a mix of Welsh and UK issues were at play, but argued that the Welsh government \"got complacent\".",
      "The activist blamed the \"way\" the 20mph speed limit was delivered - \"it told voters we weren't listening to them and we were essentially lecturing them\".",
      "\"I agree with the desired outcomes of the policy, but you can't treat voters like that,\" they said.",
      "Alun Davies, Labour Blaenau Gwent MS, acknowledged the public was \"frustrated with politics\" but said: \"Labour remains the party that probably most people in Wales feel represents their own values.\"",
      "The politician, who is involved in the production of the party's manifesto, said: \"Eluned has got the power to transform Welsh Labour's fortunes during an election campaign.",
      "\"She is very straight-talking - what you see is what you get.\"",
      "Wales' Labour first minister says she will 'call out' Starmer",
      "Politics 'doesn't work' for many people in Wales",
      "Cathy Owens said the current first minister needed two things to get to 30% of the vote or more, \"one of which is to reduce waiting times\".",
      "For the second thing, Ms Owens said Morgan needed help from her party colleagues in the UK government - \"some funding, or some extra investment\" over and above what is automatically provided through the existing Barnett formula system, which is largely based on population.",
      "\"Now, that is proving more of a sticky wicket,\" she said. \"There has been no evidence of a win so far on that\".",
      "The relationship between Welsh and Westminster Labour has become a big part of the story of Morgan's time as Welsh Labour leader.",
      "She has been increasingly keen to distance herself from Sir Kier Starmer - on Tuesday she gave a speech where she was willing to call out his government, should it take decisions that \"harm\" Welsh communities.",
      "'The polls tell a good story'",
      "One party hoping to benefit from the turn in Labour's fortunes is Plaid Cymru.",
      "The left-leaning party has long struggled to beat its strong showing in the first assembly election of 1999 when it won almost 29% of the vote, but the splintering of British politics has presented Plaid with an opportunity.",
      "Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has been presenting himself as a first minister in waiting, while the party has published plans on health and the economy it said it would enact if it formed the next Welsh government.",
      "Unlike their political cousins in Scotland, the SNP, Plaid has never won a Welsh election and came third last time round.",
      "It took part in a short-lived coalition with Labour between 2007 and 2011, and helped Labour govern more recently in the form of the co-operation deal which ended in summer 2024.",
      "\"We're not getting too carried away with the polls,\" Plaid's Senedd party chairman Llyr Gruffydd said. \"But the polls do tell a good story for us.\"",
      "\"We will clearly be highlighting the need for change. It's a tired government.\"",
      "He said the party will face a challenge in helping \"people realise that this is a different electoral system. Every single vote counts - there will not be a wasted vote\".",
      "It was put to Gruffydd that it was difficult for Plaid to be seen as anti-establishment when it had been involved in helping Labour govern. \"We won't shy away from the fact that we've been punching above our weight... and still achieving elements of our manifesto,\" he said. \"Imagine what we could do if we were in government.\"",
      "'There's so much frustration'",
      "One party hoping to make their big entrance into Welsh politics is Farage's Reform UK.",
      "The party has polled closely to Labour and Plaid Cymru and came second in 13 seats at the last general election. While it has five MPs in England, and some councillors in Wales, it has no-one at Senedd at present.",
      "It is celebrating its recent English local election successes, where it made big gains, won control of 10 councils, two mayors and a by-election from Labour.",
      "Pointing to who the party is in Wales is difficult - it is yet to decide who will stand for them at the next election, or who might act as a figurehead.",
      "They are not starting from scratch - Farage's previous party UKIP had a short-lived stint in the Senedd after it won seven AMs in 2017.",
      "At least one of their former AMs is hoping to become a Reform MS - Caroline Jones. She is hoping to stand for Reform in the seat of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg - which covers Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"It's all depressing to be honest\". Those are the words of one Labour MP, hitherto proudly supportive of the government, as they returned to Parliament on Tuesday morning.",
      "The anger among Labour MPs in the aftermath of the party's local elections drubbing was striking in its breadth and depth. The evidence so far is that it did not dissipate over the long weekend.",
      "The focus of many MPs' rage - and it is rage - is the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.",
      "It is not just the view of critical MPs that this harmed Labour in the elections, but of cabinet ministers too.",
      "Earlier Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Breakfast: \"I'm not going to insult your viewers by pretending that winter fuel didn't come up on the doorstep, of course it did, and I know that people aren't happy about winter fuel allowance in lots of cases.\"",
      "Government sources spent Tuesday morning scotching the suggestion that a formal review of the policy is under way, and by the afternoon they were adamant.",
      "\"There will not be a change to the government's policy,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.",

      "Henry Zeffman: Seven things we have learnt from the election results",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "That will be a disappointment to those Labour MPs who believed that reversing the policy on winter fuel would be the clearest sign to the public that the prime minister, as he said on Friday morning, \"gets it\".",
      "Others closer to government thinking questioned whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has been done.",
      "Given the categorical denial of any wiggle room on winter fuel, more topical perhaps is the debate over the government's welfare reforms.",
      "The changes in eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) were announced in March but require parliamentary approval. A vote in the House of Commons is likely next month.",
      "Given Sir Keir's colossal majority there is no prospect of the government losing that vote. But there is the possibility that it becomes the locus of broader disaffection with the government's direction.",
      "One Labour MP who identified winter fuel and Pip as the two key reasons for Labour's poor showing last week said the latter was a more acute problem.",
      "\"When people were complaining about winter fuel on the doorstep you'd look at the [canvassing] sheet and often it's people who have never voted for us or haven't voted for us for a long time. With Pip, they were our people.\"",
      "Even those Labour MPs who are more frustrated than angry at the decline in the party's support over the past ten months believe that Sir Keir and his team need to do more to carry their parliamentary ranks with them.",
      "\"There's still a lot of goodwill,\" one said. \"But if we don't have a sense of what the strategic direction is soon then the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] will become unmanageable.\"",
      "Pat McFadden, one of the most senior cabinet ministers but also the director of Labour's successful 2024 general election campaign, will deliver a presentation to MPs about the local election results on Wednesday evening.",
      "Questions about the party's strategic direction will be paramount. Though the principal beneficiary of Thursday's local elections at Labour's expense was Reform UK, there are plenty in Labour who worry just as much about bleeding votes on their left flank to more progressive parties such as the Greens.",
      "Many are noting that in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election the Conservative vote more than halved, at least partly due to defections to Labour to stop Reform. Meanwhile, the Green vote actually nudged upwards.",
      "\"We couldn't squeeze the progressive vote - and we'll need to do that at the general election,\" one government source said.",
      "Cooler heads believe that in the scenario of a general election where the most plausible prime ministers were Sir Keir or Nigel Farage, voters on the broad left would inevitably coalesce around Labour.",
      "And whereas the next general election is as much as four years away, events over the next few weeks could help.",
      "A UK-EU summit on May 19 is seen as an opportunity to put significant meat on the bones of the European \"reset\" for which the prime minister has spent much of the past year pushing.",
      "Party strategists believe that a clear demonstration from the prime minister that he believes the UK should be more closely allied to Europe will boost progressive support.",
      "It could also solve other problems. If the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) were to upgrade its forecasts for economic growth as a result of closer ties to the EU, then that would give Rachel Reeves more money to spend in this autumn's Budget.",
      "Before the EU summit, however, comes next week's immigration white paper - which will contain more detail of the government's plans to reduce legal migration and improve the asylum system.",
      "This is seen in government both as a crucial way to demonstrate to sceptical voters that Labour is serious about dealing with their concerns about immigration, as well as a potentially tricky moment for the progressive segment of Labour's coalition.",
      "\"We can't be sheepish about this, we need to make an argument to our own people that there's nothing progressive about letting people smugglers run the English Channel or letting cheap foreign labour undercut good wages,\" one government source said.",
      "And once the rage subsides, many in the Labour Party remember that things could be worse.",
      "Unlike the Conservatives, confronting arguably a much deeper malaise, Labour are in government at control of the levers of power.",
      "\"Things are going to materially improve over the coming years,\" a senior government source said. \"There is no way through this that doesn't involve making people feel better off.\"",

    "summary": "It suggests the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019.",
    "story": [
      "There is no doubt that Reform performed well in Thursday's local council elections. The party won most votes, most seats and overall control of most councils.",
      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",
      "Instead of insulating Conservative and Labour from the impact of a third-party challenge, as it has done so often before, first past the post exacerbated their losses. In both cases Reform took nearly half of all the seats those parties were defending.",
      "The map above is the most detailed local election mapping ever produced by the BBC. It details the strength of the Reform vote in every ward that voted on Thursday and shows support for Reform varied considerably.",
      "That variation has some striking and important features. They suggest the party was particularly popular among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019 - and that Reform's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote.",
      "Brexit still a fault line",
      "Reflecting the party's anti-EU stance, Reform did much better in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.",
      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 04:54:59 GMT",
    "summary": "A powerful prime minister tries and fails to stop an Old Labour stalwart's progress to City Hall.",
    "story": [
      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",
      "However, Livingstone's ability to alienate prime ministers wasn't confined to Conservatives.",
      "Tony Blair was also not a Ken fan.",
      "\"Red\" Ken, as he was known, was Old Labour, not New Labour.",
      "The message from Downing St was clear: Stop Ken.",
      "The party management tried to get the very popular Mo Mowlam to stand, then switched to Frank Dobson.",
      "A bearded, avuncular figure who was serving as New Labour's first health secretary, he was 'persuaded' to stand against his old comrade Ken.",
      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",
      "Livingstone was his party's standard bearer again in both 2008 and 2012, on both occasions losing to a young Conservative contender called Boris Johnson.",

      "There is much we don't know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but if any of it does survive, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.\" said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency.",

      "This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America.",

    "story": [
      "In a significant blow to the government's clean energy ambitions the Danish energy company Orsted has cancelled plans for a huge windfarm off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "The Hornsea 4 project would have become one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4GW \u2013 enough to power more than a million homes.",
      "Orsted said the project no longer made economic sense, despite signing a 15-year contract with the UK government guaranteeing to sell power at an agreed price.",
      "The UK's offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs in recent years, as the government has acknowledged.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said it recognised \"the effect that globally high inflation and supply chain constraints are having on industry across Europe.\"",
      "But this is the second developer to pull out of a major offshore project.",
      "The Swedish company Vattenfall halted development of a 1.4GW wind farm off the coast of Norfolk in July 2023, again due to rising costs.",
      "Thay project was sold to the German energy company RWE, which has said it plans to see the project through.",
      "However, the difficulties offshore developers are facing raise significant questions about the viability of the government's clean power by 2030 target \u2013 one of the Labour government's five central \"missions\".",
      "Just over half of the country's power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass \u2013 organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 \u2013 so in just five years' time.",
      "In order to meet that target the UK will need to triple offshore wind capacity and double the amount of solar and onshore wind power on the system, according to estimates by Aurora Energy.",
      "It will also need a significant upgrade to the electricity grid with 620 miles of new power lines as well as substations and other equipment.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 20:13:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "The blue carpet was rolled out for the premiere the Royal Festival Hall in London.",
      "In attendance was the King, told Sir David he \"can't believe\" his 99th birthday was on Thursday.",
      "The pair posed for photos before they entered the auditorium for the screening.",
      "A host of celebrities also attended, including singer Geri Halliwell-Horner, astronaut Tim Peake, singer James Blunt and model Cara Delevingne.",
      "Earlier, Prince William attended a matinee in a \"private capacity\", along with hundreds of children from schools across the country.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",
      "As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.",

    "story": [
      "About 1.2m people in the UK were affected by banking outages that happened on what was pay day for many earlier this year.",
      "The details have emerged in letters from Lloyds, TSB, Nationwide and HSBC to Dame Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, which is looking into the incident that occurred on Friday, 28 February.",
      "HSBC also revealed that customers had to wait two hours on average that day to reach its online customer service team. Its standard target wait time is five minutes.",
      "In their correspondence, the banks said they had paid compensation to affected customers and also outlined what they were doing to try to prevent similar problems in the future.",
      "Pay day problems",
      "Lloyds Banking Group customers faced the biggest impact from the February outages.",
      "Ron van Kemenade, the bank's group chief operating officer, said around 700,000 people who are customers of Lloyds, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and MBNA were affected as they couldn't log into their accounts on a first attempt.",
      "However Mr van Kemenade argued it did not amount to an outage, as there were five million successful logins during the period of disruption.",
      "Nonetheless, the bank said it was improving its log-in infrastructure and monitoring systems following the incident.",
      "The letters from the banks revealed about 250,000 TSB customers, 196,255 from Nationwide and 60,000 from HSBC also faced disruption on that morning.",
      "The banks have paid out over \u00a3114,000 in compensation to customers so far, with Nationwide (\u00a384,341) paying the most.",
      "All the banks said there was no evidence of an increase in fraudulent activity during the disruption, and said there was also no indication that outages were more prevalent at some times - such as pay days - than at other periods.",
      "Fine and failing infrastructure",
      "The pay day outage was far from the only IT problem the banking sector has experienced.",
      "In March, it emerged that nine major banks and building societies operating in the UK accumulated at least 803 hours - the equivalent of 33 days - of tech outages in the past two years.",

      "Experts including Patrick Burgess of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, and Shilpa Doreswamy, a director with GFT, a company committed to the digital transformation of the financial sector, have stated that the recent outages reveal the problems banks have with ageing infrastructure and failing IT systems.",

      "\"They've highlighted the need for banks to invest in IT modernisation to prevent the eroding of customer trust,\" she said.",

      "The Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - is seeking a judicial review of rules which could mean Wikipedia is subjected to the toughest duties required of websites under the act.",
      "Lead counsel Phil Bradley-Schmieg said it was \"unfortunate that we must now defend the privacy and safety of Wikipedia's volunteer editors from flawed legislation\".",
      "The government told the BBC it was committed to implementing the act but could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "It's thought this is the first judicial review to be brought against the new online safety laws - albeit a narrow part of them - but experts say it may not be the last.",
      "\"The Online Safety Act is vast in scope and incredibly complex,\" Ben Packer, a partner at law firm Linklaters, told the BBC.",

      "The Wikimedia Foundation stresses it is not trying to challenge the OSA in general, or the idea that there should be Category 1 services subject to additional duties.",
      "Instead, it is challenging parts of the so-called \"Categorisation Regulations\" that set out how the regulator Ofcom will decide which sites will have to follow the most stringent duties.",
      "It argues, as currently defined, they risk not only inappropriately catching sites such as Wikipedia but also missing some platforms which should be abiding by tougher rules.",

      "In the days before Zoom, WhatsApp and Teams, the video call service was once one of the world's most popular websites.",
      "It allowed people to make computer-to-computer calls free, and then became the way users could make low cost calls to landlines and mobiles to people in other parts of the world.",
      "In recent years though, Skype has been diminishing as its owner Microsoft focussed on Teams. Its services will close for good on 5 May, with the Skype for Business feature the only part to remain.",
      "Here are just some of the many people whose lives were touched by Skype since it launched in 2003.",
      "The long-distance couple who fell in love",
      "Weng and Owen Williams have a lot to thank Skype for - it is one of the main reasons they are married.",
      "In 2012, Weng left Macau, China to start a six-month internship at a National Trust site in Carmarthenshire, Wales.",
      "Feeling a bit homesick, she would speak to friends and family on Skype. She then met Owen, who was also working for the National Trust.",
      "At first they were friends, but after Weng returned to Macau, romance blossomed over months of Skype chats and visits to see one another.",
      "\"Skype was a very important part of our relationship,\" she said.",
      "When they decided to embark on a long-distance relationship, Skype was the glue that held it together.",
      "They video called every day - including when Weng sent Owen a birthday cake and he cut it in front of her during their chat.",
      "\"That was quite sweet,\" she said. \"Skype just kept us going.\"",
      "The pair ultimately got engaged, and Weng moved back to Wales in 2015.",
      "Now, they are happily married.",
      "Dealing with the death of a loved one",
      "Like many over the years, Erica from New Zealand used Skype to communicate with a loved one while they were in another part of the world.",
      "In her case, it was her husband when one of them was on a work trip.",
      "Following his death in 2017, Skype took on another role for Erica, who spoke to the BBC anonymously.",
      "\"I was clearing out his files to decommission his work computer,\" she told BBC News.",

    "story": [
      "High above the Arctic Circle, the archipelago of Svalbard lies halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole.",
      "Frozen, mountainous, and remote, it's home to hundreds of polar bears and a couple of sparse settlements.",
      "One of those is Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, and just outside the settlement, in a decommissioned coal mine, is The Arctic World Archive (AWA) - an  underground vault for data.",
      "Customers pay to have their data stored on film and kept in the vault, for potentially hundreds of years.",
      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",
      "The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.",
      "Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.",
      "\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.",
      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",
      "Many firms offer long-term data storage.",
      "Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.",
      "For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.",
      "Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.",
      "That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.",
      "The Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.",
      "Photographer, Christian Clauwers, who's been documenting South Pacific Islands threatened by sea level rise, was also adding his work.",
      "\"I deposited footage and photography, visual witnesses of the Marshall Islands,\" he says.",
      "\"The highest point of the island is three meters, and they're facing huge impact of climate change.\"",

      "\"I have all these formats that are becoming obsolete.",

      "Speaking the day after he was elected as the 267th Pope and first US leader of the Church, he warned that people were turning away from faith and instead to \"technology, money, success, power, or pleasure\".",
      "Leo said he had been elected to be a \"faithful administrator\" of a Church that would act as a \"beacon that illuminates the dark nights of this world\".",
      "The ascension of Robert Francis Prevost has been celebrated by the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, with joyous outbursts in his US homeland and in Peru, where he served for 20 years.",
      "In his sermon on Friday, the new Pope said there were many settings where the Christian faith was considered \"absurd\" - with power, wealth, and technology dominating - but it was precisely there that missionary outreach was needed.",
      "\"A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society,\" he said in the address delivered in Italian.",
      "Pope Leo, 69, wore a white papal robe trimmed in gold as he addressed the seated cardinals in the Sistine Chapel, an event broadcast live by the Vatican administration.",
      "In an unscripted introduction before the homily, Leo also called on Church unity  from his cardinals, telling them in American-accented English: \"I know I can rely on each and every one of you to walk with me\".",
      "Following weeks of anticipation, the previously-unknown Prevost was introduced as the new Pope to the world on Thursday evening in St Peter's Square.",
      "Tens of thousands of worshippers in the square burst into cheers when white smoke curled out of the Vatican's chimney on the second day of the conclave's voting.",

      "World leaders have rushed to congratulate Prevost on his election, pledging to work with him on global issues amid uncertain times. US President Donald Trump called it a \"great honour\" to have the first American pope.",
      "Prevost, who had previously been the Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru, was only made an archbishop and then cardinal in 2023. He was elected by his fellow cardinals in what is believed to be four rounds of voting in the secret conclave that took place two weeks after Francis died.",
      "He is seen as being aligned with the progressive late Pope, who was viewed as a champion of human rights and the poor and celebrated for his charismatic style that sought to make the Catholic Church more outward-facing.",
      "Vatican watchers have noted that Francis appeared to have brought Prevost to Rome in recent years, perhaps to set him up as a potential successor.",
      "The Augustinian missionary worked for decades with the poor and marginalised in Peru, where he obtained nationality in 2015.",
      "In his previous role as Cardinal Prevost, he had also expressed or amplified criticism of the US administration under President Trump, including its anti-immigration policies.",
      "On an X account under his name, he had criticised Vice President JD Vance in February. Vance, who is a Catholic convert, had said Christians should love their family, neighbours, community and fellow citizens in that order. Prevost had written: \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others\".",
      "As Pope now, he faces a momentous task in leading the Church in a time of significant global conflicts. Observers have expressed hope that he can offer a counterpoint to more divisive voices on the world stage.",
      "His next appearances, at Sunday's midday Regina Coeli prayer in St Peter's Basilica and a Monday news conference with journalists, will be closely watched for signs as to which direction he intends to lead the Church and what kind of Pope he will be."

      "For the first time, a column of trucks carrying various combat drones took part in the Victory Day parade, apparently because of their widescale use in Ukraine.",
      "A unilateral, three-day ceasefire was announced by Russia to coincide with the lavish 80th anniversary event, which Ukraine rejected as a \"theatrical show\".",
      "Kyiv has labelled the truce as a farce, accusing Russia of launching thousands of attacks since it came into force at midnight on Wednesday. Russia says it has observed the ceasefire and accuses Ukraine of hundreds of violations.",

Serbia is an EU candidate country and Vucic said he expected he would face consequences because of his decision to go.",

      "Although Chinese forces played a prominent role in fighting against Japan, the government in Taiwan said Beijing and Moscow had distorted history. Taiwan said Chinese communist forces had made \"no substantial contribution\" in the war, unlike China's then republican government, which later fled to Taiwan.",

      "He denied Israel would take part in aid delivery or distribution, but said its forces would secure the centres' perimeters.",

      "He added: \"There is no reason to put in place a system that is at odds with the DNA of any principled humanitarian organisation.\"",
      "Since early March, Israel has cut off all supplies from reaching Gaza - including food, shelters, medicines and fuel - leading to a humanitarian crisis for its 2.1 million residents.",
      "A third of the community kitchens in Gaza - one of the territory's last remaining lifelines - have been forced to shut down over the past two weeks due to shortages of food and fuel, according to OCHA.",
      "Among them were the last two field kitchens of World Central Kitchen, a US-based charity which had been providing 133,000 meals daily before it ran out of ingredients on Tuesday.",
      "Prices of basic foodstuffs have also skyrocketed at local markets, with a 25kg (55lb) bag of flour now selling for $415 (\u00a3313) in Gaza City - a 30-fold increase compared to the end of February, OCHA says.",
      "Huckabee told journalists in Jerusalem that US President Donald Trump saw aid for Gaza as an urgent matter and that his team was tasked \"to do everything possible to accelerate that and to as expeditiously as possible get humanitarian aid into the people\".",
      "Israel and the US accuse Hamas of diverting aid. \"Previous actions have often been met with Hamas stealing the food that was intended for hungry people,\" the ambassador said.",
      "The UN and other agencies say they have strong supervisory mechanisms and that when aid has surged into Gaza, incidents of looting have largely halted. The World Health Organization says none of its medical supplies have been looted during the war.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to build momentum behind the new aid initiative ahead of the president's trip next week to wealthy Arab Gulf countries that could help to fund it.",
      "It says that a non-governmental organisation has been set up and that aid delivery will not be under Israeli military control.",
      "Huckabee said: \"The Israelis are going to be involved in providing necessary security because this is a war zone. But they will not be involved in the distribution of the food, or even the bringing of food into Gaza.\"",
      "The newly registered Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) appears to have been set up for this purpose.",
      "A 14-page document from GHF, seen by the BBC, promises to set up four distribution sites, giving out food, water and hygiene kits initially for 1.2 million people - less than 60% of the population. It says the project aims to reach all Gazans eventually.",
      "Aimed at potential donors, the paper states that \"months of conflict have collapsed traditional relief channels in Gaza\".",
      "It goes on: \"GHF was established to restore that vital lifeline through an independent, rigorously-audited model that gets assistance directly - and only - to those in need.\"",
      "The document maintains that GHF is \"guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence\".",
      "Its boards of directors and advisors are said to include a former chief executive of World Central Kitchen, along with the American former head of the UN's World Food Programme, David Beasley - though his participation is not yet confirmed.",
      "Full details of how the aid mechanism will work on the ground are not given.",
      "The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,700 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Last Sunday, Israel's security cabinet approved an intensified military offensive against Hamas in Gaza which could involve forcibly displacing the population to the south, seizing the entire territory indefinitely, and controlling aid.",
      "This was quickly met with widespread international condemnation. Many of Israel's allies pointed out that it was bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid.",
      "The UK's Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, told Parliament on Monday that the British government was gravely concerned that the Israeli announcements could lead to the 19-month-long war in Gaza entering \"a dangerous new phase\".",
      "On the subject of aid, he said: \"As the UN has said, it is hard to see how, if implemented, the new Israeli plan to deliver aid through private companies would be consistent with humanitarian principles and meet the scale of the need. We need urgent clarity from the Israeli government on their intentions.",
      "\"We must remember what is at stake. These humanitarian principles matter for every conflict around the world. They should be applied consistently in every war zone.\"",
      "This week, the US Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, briefed members of the UN Security Council - which includes the UK - behind closed doors about the new plan to resume the delivery of aid.",
      "Meanwhile, Israeli media reported that Israeli forces were already setting up distribution hubs in Rafah, in southern Gaza, in \"a sterile zone\" designed to be free of any Hamas presence.",
      "According to reports, Israel expects that aid will be distributed to security-screened representatives from each Gazan family who would be allowed to take supplies for his or her relatives only. They would be allowed into the hubs only on foot.",
      "The Israeli defence establishment was said to have assessed that the average quantity of aid that would have to be distributed as 70kg (154lb) per family per week.",
      "The Israeli military would ultimately be stationed outside the distribution hubs, allowing aid workers to hand out food without soldiers being directly involved, the reports say.",
      "Israel and the US argue that the new system would prevent Hamas from being able to steal food for its own benefit. By preventing its access to aid and involvement in security for convoys, they hope to reduce the group's influence over the Gazan population.",
      "However, there are major questions over the plan's feasibility. The current UN system uses some 400 points of aid distribution, while the situation in Gaza is now at a crisis point, with warnings that mass starvation is imminent.",
      "At a UN briefing in Geneva, aid officials said they had carried out \"careful analysis\" before deciding they could not participate in the US-Israeli scheme. They said they had not been formally presented with the GHF document that is currently circulating.",
      "James Elder, spokesman for the UN's children's agency Unicef, said the plan that had been laid out would lead to more children suffering, not fewer. He noted that civilians would have to travel to militarised zones to receive aid, meaning the most vulnerable - children and the elderly - would struggle to get there.",
      "He said the decision to locate all the distribution points in the south appeared designed to use aid as \"a bait\" to forcibly displace Gazans once again. The UN says 90% of the population has been displaced during the war, often many times.",
      "The plan that has been discussed with UN agencies envisages just 60 lorry loads of aid entering each day - far less than they say is needed to meet growing needs, and a tenth of the number that went in daily during the recent two-month ceasefire.",
      "OCHA's Jens Laerke said that in short, the proposals from Israel \"do not meet the minimum bar for principled humanitarian support\".",
      "Analysts say that the current impasse over aid for Gaza is not only an existential threat to the UN's vast humanitarian operation in the Palestinian territory but could also have implications for its future work.",
      "If it was to agree to a scheme accommodating the demands of the military on one side in a conflict, it could dent perceptions of the UN's neutrality and impartiality, and set a dangerous precedent leading to similar demands in other war zones where it operates.",
      "The UN and other aid agencies also point out that they currently have tonnes of supplies piled up near Gaza's border crossings, ready to enter, if Israel would allow it.",
      "Without an end to the blockade, the risk of famine is expected to grow.",
      "In Jabalia, in northern Gaza, which has already been the focus of Israeli military operations against Hamas, Palestinian families told the BBC of their growing despair as they waited for a food handout at a takia, or community kitchen, which turned into a chaotic scramble.",
      "\"Every day I come here and wait with my cooking pot to feed my children,\" Umm Ahmed said. \"The pot doesn't fill us up. We have been suffering for two months. There's no flour or anything. Open the borders so we can eat properly.\"",
      "She said she would not comply with Israeli efforts to force her to move south to Rafah to receive aid.",
      "\"We don't have money for transport, we don't have money to eat!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't want to evacuate from here, I'd rather die than leave.\"",
      "\"The takia is our last source of food,\" said Mohammed, who had been waiting for five hours in line. \"My wife is pregnant and sick and I'm unable to get her to the hospital.  How am I supposed to get to Rafah?\"",

    "summary": "Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry. What next?",
    "story": [
      "The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.",
      "On Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.",
      "Pakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.",
      "As Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.",
      "\"The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,\" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.",
      "Follow our live updates",
      "Follow our live updates",
      "Since Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.",
      "Pakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.",
      "Laser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement.",
      "Drones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. \"This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,\" says Prof Matisek.",
      "Experts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.",
      "The Heron, say experts, is India's \"high-altitude eyes in the sky\" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft).",
      "While many believe India's combat drone numbers remain \"modest\", a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities.",
      "India is also developing swarm drone tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.",
      "Pakistan's drone fleet is \"extensive and diverse\", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.",
      "He said the inventory includes \"over a thousand drones\", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities.",
      "What we know about India's strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir",
      "Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it",
      "Indian and Pakistani civilians describe aftermath of strikes and shelling",
      "Mr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of \"loyal wingman\" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.",
      "Prof Matisek believes \"Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race\".",
      "While the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.",
      "\"Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,\" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.",
      "Ejaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu \"appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]\".",
      "\"A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,\" Mr Haider says.",
      "While drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.",
      "\"The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,\" says Mr Joshi.",
      "\"This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.\"",
      "Clearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.",
      "\"Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,\" says Prof Matisek.",
      "\"But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers.\"",

      "Orban's government is among few in Europe that has maintained close ties to Russia following the invasion.",
      "Taken in isolation, these arrests and the alleged espionage network involved amount to a relatively minor event.",

      "By the time they reached the square, a white haze was still hovering over the left hand side of the Apostolic Palace where 133 cardinals had been locked away since the day before, voting to elect the new head of the Catholic Church.",

      "Who is the new pope, Robert Prevost?",
      "It was less than three weeks ago that Pope Francis blessed the crowds from the balcony at St Peter's, and his memory hung over the square on Thursday; almost everyone asked to share their impressions mentioned Francis and the need for the new Pope to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\"We just arrived today from America,\" one woman named Amanda told the BBC. \"It feels like a blessing. We came here for this and here it is.\"",
      "\"Divine timing!\" she joked. Two stylish women in their 20s said they were \"about to cry\". \"It's a historic moment, it's crazy,\" one said, adding she hoped the next Pope would be \"at least as good as the last one\".",
      "This was a sentiment echoed by many in those last minutes before Pope Leo XIV was announced.",
      "\"It doesn't matter to us where he's from as long as he follows in on Francis' footsteps and creates unity for all of us Catholics,\" said a French woman as she herded her five children to get closer to the front of the square.",
      "By the time Dominique Mamberti - the proto-deacon tasked with delivering the iconic \"Habemus Papam\" address to the square - appeared on the balcony, St Peter's was full to the brim. It fell silent, though, once Robert Francis Prevost's name was read out.",
      "Those in the know may have identified the Chicago-born 69-year-old cardinal - who worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made a bishop there \u2013 as a potential pontiff early on.",
      "But many people in the square looked puzzled at first, and the complete lack of phone coverage meant that most couldn't look him up on the internet - so the first impression most got of Pope Leo XIV came down to the way he introduced himself from the ornate balcony.",
      "Visibly moved at first, and dressed in white and red vestments and speaking in confident - if lightly accented - Italian, he read out a much lengthier speech than the remarks made by his predecessor Francis in 2013.",
      "\"I would like this greeting of peace to reach all your hearts and families\u2026 and people around the world. May peace be with you,\" the new Pope began as the square fell silent.",
      "At other moments, his address was met with frequent warm applause, especially when he mentioned \"peace\" - which he did on nine occasions - and the late Francis.",
      "A section of the speech delivered in Spanish in which Pope Leo XIV remembered his time in Peru was met with cheers from various pockets of South Americans dotted across the square.",
      "He also insisted on the need for unity, and at the end asked everyone to join together in prayer. When he began reciting Ave Maria, a deep hum rose as the square followed suit, with some praying in their own languages.",
      "The crowd began to slowly amble out of the square shortly after. As people streamed past them, a young couple held each other close, beaming. \"I still have goosebumps,\" said Carla, from Barcelona.",
      "\"The energy is contagious, it's amazing - it's our first time here, and for me it's 100% surreal,\" said Juan, who is from Ecuador and had never been to the Vatican before. Asked what his hope for Pope Leo XIV was, he said: \"That the Holy Spirit guides him. I hope that means we can all be united together going forward.\"",
      "Gemma, a Rome resident, said she hadn't even heard the name Robert Prevost until she came across it on Instagram this morning. \"The reaction of the square wasn't that warm,\" her friend Marco added.",
      "\"If he'd been Italian everyone would have kicked off.\" \"But it was a beautiful evening, a beautiful occasion,\" said Gemma. \"It was my first conclave. And this new Pope is only 69, so who knows when the next one will be?\"",
      "The square emptied. The restaurants around the Vatican filled up with pilgrims, clergy, and tourists. Couples snapped the last selfies outside the basilica.",

      "Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases.",

      "The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January.",
      "But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK.",
      "Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year.",
      "No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details.",
      "Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\".",

      "US agreement leaves the UK open to do a much more significant EU deal",

      "That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs.",
      "\"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\"",

      "The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative.",
      "The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.",
      "Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products.",

      "Unrwa said that more than 550 pupils aged six to 15 were present and that one of its staff members was detained, in what its director in the occupied West Bank called \"a traumatising experience for young children who are at immediate risk of losing their access to education\".",
      "The agency said that Israeli police were also deployed at three other schools in East Jerusalem, forcing them to send their students home too.",
      "\"Storming schools and forcing them shut is a blatant disregard of international law,\" Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. \"These schools are inviolable premises of the United Nations.\"",

      "When the allegation were first made public last year, Survival said that African Parks had known about the alleged abuse of the Baka people since 2013.",

      "The Ukrainian military escorted us to an artillery position, south-west of the fiercely contested city of Pokrovsk.",
      "Overcast skies made the drive through mud tracks running past wide open fields slightly less vulnerable to attacks from drones.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin had proposed a three-day ceasefire starting at midnight local time on 8 May, to coincide with the anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe \u2013 a public holiday in Russia on Friday known as Victory Day.",
      "But from the artillery position we heard the sounds of continuous explosions \u2013 incoming and outgoing mortar fire -  evidence that there was no ceasefire in the trenches and on the frontlines.",
      "I asked Serhii, one of the soldiers of the 3rd Operational Brigade of the National Guard if there had been any attacks from Russia overnight.",
      "\"Yes, they have been attacking overnight. We have had glide bombs and drones here. Russia can't be trusted. In the evening they call a truce and in the morning they attack. There is no truce. We are always prepared for anything,\" he said.",
      "Some minutes later, he was sent the co-ordinates of a target over the radio. A few soldiers ran through deep muddy trenches, to a clearing where a howitzer was hidden from sight, covered by branches and leaves. They uncovered it, pointed it in the right direction and fired. It let out a deafening sound, and the recoil blew up leaves and dust from the ground.",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky had rejected Russia's unilateral three-day ceasefire. Instead, he has called for a longer 30-day truce, as proposed by the US, a proposal that has once again been reiterated by its President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform on Thursday night.",

Thousands of people still live in the city, among them are many of those who've been forced to move here because their home towns have become too dangerous to live in.",
      "We meet Svitlana who is from Pokrovsk but has now relocated to Dobropillya. I asked her if she thought Russia's ceasefire call had made any difference on the ground. \"You can hear the sounds here,\" she said, referring to the continuous sounds of explosion, like rolling thunder, that we could hear from the outskirts of the city. \"That is the sound of Russia's ceasefire. That's why I say we should never trust them.\"",
      "Twenty-six-year-old Serhiy chimes in: \"The ceasefire is announced just to confuse people and deceive them, and so they (Russia) can say to the world 'we are so good, we are trying to get Ukraine through peaceful means' but in reality, everything they do is the opposite of it.\"",

      "The fact that the conclave was over quickly suggests that from the outset, a significant number of the voting cardinals felt Robert Prevost was the one amongst them best equipped to take on the challenges a pope faces.",
      "In the lead up to the election - during the formal meetings of cardinals, and the informal dinners and coffees they had to discuss the type of person they were looking for - it was apparent that two words kept coming up, \"continuity\" and \"unity\".",

      "There was appreciation for his endeavour to become a voice for the voiceless and focus on the poor and those whose destinies were not in their own hands.",
      "But there was also a sense that work had to be done to resolve the (sometimes very public) splits between those of different schools of thought within the Church hierarchy, often characterised as traditionalist and progressive.",
      "It was in that context that Robert Prevost's name started to be talked of as a serious contender. As someone who supported Pope Francis behind the scenes, but who different factions could still think of as one of their own.",
      "But the voting cardinals had been tasked by the Church with considering not just what the institution and Catholic believers needed, but also what humanity needed at a difficult juncture, with war and division the backdrop.",
      "Again, Cardinal Prevost - the US-Peruvian dual national, who was talked of as feeling as at home with his North American peers as he was with Latin American colleagues - was seen as someone who, as pope, could connect different worlds.",
      "'Building bridges'",
      "Pope Francis was sometimes criticised for lacking an ability to win more allies in the US on the big issues of migration, climate change and inequality, because of a disconnect in understanding the most effective ways of communicating his arguments to them.",
      "For those who had in their minds that the primary requirement being sought of a new pope was an ability to bring \"continuity\" and \"unity\", during his speech on St Peter's balcony, Leo XIV gave strong clues as to why the cardinals chose him.",
      "In his talk of \"building bridges\" and people globally being \"one people\" he evoked echoes of Pope Francis and also talked of unity at its fullest.",
      "In these early days, his past will be heavily scrutinised.  His political views examined, his track record on dealing with abuse dissected, and his comments over the years on social issues charted.",
      "Much of this is already in the public domain so it can only be assumed that the cardinal electors felt there was nothing of enough consequence to impair his ability to lead the Catholic Church and be the global moral voice they were looking for.",
      "Huge challenges lie ahead. But with resolution after just four conclave votes, he starts out with a strong mandate from the men he will need the most through his papacy."

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 11:55:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts from India and Pakistan weigh in on what\u2019s next -  and how this clash differs from past conflicts.",
    "story": [
      "In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on \"credible intelligence\".",
      "The strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.",
      "Pakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed.",
      "Islamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.",
      "Follow the latest updatesWhat we know about the air strikes",
      "Follow the latest updates",
      "What we know about the air strikes",
      "This sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.",
      "Does this attack mark a new escalation?",
      "In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC.",
      "In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.",
      "Experts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.",
      "India says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen.",
      "Among the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson.",
      "The deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said.",
      "Pakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.",
      "\"What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,\" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.",
      "\"This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,\" he says.",
      "The India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.",
      "Ajay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a \"Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message\".",
      "\"These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,\" Mr Bisaria says.",
      "Indian sources say the strikes were aimed at \"re-establishing deterrence\".",
      "\"The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,\" says Prof Raghavan.",
      "\"This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control.\"",
      "Could this spiral into a broader conflict?",
      "The majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.",
      "\"Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,\" says Mr Bisaria.",
      "\"Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.\"",
      "India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past",
      "India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past",
      "Pakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were \"largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions\".",
      "Dr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.",
      "\"Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,\" he told the BBC.",
      "But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could \"escalate into a limited conventional war\".",
      "Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, \"visible damage at key sites\", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.",
      "\"Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',\" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.",
      "\"Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,\" he said.",
      "Despite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.",
      "\"There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,\" says Mr Clary.",
      "However, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the \"most dangerous\" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.",
      "Is Pakistani retaliation now inevitable?",
      "Experts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.",
      "\"We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,\" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.",
      "\"Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.\"",
      "Dr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.",
      "\"I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,\" he says.",
      "\"The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.",
      "\"Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.\"",
      "Can India and Pakistan step back from the brink?",
      "India is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint.",
      "Shortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.",
      "This mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links.",
      "The crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.",
      "\"India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,\" Mr Bisaria told me last week."

The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment.",
      "Pitt's lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt \u2014 an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes \u2014 can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\" Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "He added, \"In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\"",
      "Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done.",
      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of lumber.",
      "The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021.",
      "TMZ reported in 2022 that Pitt was arrested in Brooklyn for allegedly punching a man after taking his phone and, two months later, was brought to a hospital under police escort after a public outburst\u00a0in New York.",
      "Pitt, who grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, played the character Jimmy Darmody for two seasons on HBO's \"Boardwalk Empire,\" with the cast led by Steve Buscemi winning Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2011 and 2012 for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The show also won\u00a0a Golden Globe for best drama series in 2011.",
      "His first major role came in the 2001 film \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\" In 2005, he starred in \"Last Days,\" director Gus Van Sant's film about a fictional rock star inspired by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He also played Henry Parker in one season of The WB's \"Dawson's Creek\" in 1999-2000.",

    "summary": "Music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing trial on sex-trafficking charges. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and opening statements are expected on Monday, May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics.",
      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",

Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said.",

      "The Met Gala's theme changes every year to celebrate the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition. The year's theme: \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.\"",
      "It is the first Met exhibit devoted exclusively to Black designers and the first in more than two decades to focus on menswear, according to The Associated Press.",
      "\"I think honoring minorities, honoring Black and brown people in these spaces and outside every day, is important,\" musical artist Janelle Mon\u00e1e, told the wire service. \"The ones who have dedicated their lives to this country to serve, build and give us art to sustain us for a lifetime. We should continue to honor them and push forward and stand on their shoulders.\"",
      "Mon\u00e1e is a member this year's Gala host committee, along with Simone Biles, Spike Lee, Ayo Edebiri, Andr\u00e9 3000, and other public figures across sports and the arts.",
      "The museum in February revealed the event's co-chairs and host committee as well as its dress code, \"Tailored for You.\" It relates to the exhibition, focusing on tailored suiting styles and menswear, but leaves room for interpretation.",
      "The 2025 Met Gala co-chairs are actor Colman Domingo, Formula I driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky, hip hop impresario Pharrell Williams, and fashion icon Anna Wintour, the long-time editor-in-chief of Vogue. NBA star LeBron James is serving as an honorary chair, according to The Met.",
      "The annual benefit provides the costume department with its primary source of annual funding for exhibitions, publications, acquisitions and other operating costs. This year's event has already raised a record $31 million, according to the Met.",
      "One day before the Met Gala, a newer red-carpet event, The Debt Gala, will be held in Brooklyn. The event was founded to raise funds for organizations that help relieve medical debt for people in marginalized communities. It also has a theme: Let Them Eat Cake: Ruined Riches. Tickets cost $35.",

      "Police in Brazil said on Sunday that two people have been arrested in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Saturday's event drew some 2 million fans to Copacabana Beach.",
      "Rio de Janeiro's state police said they had worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group that was spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community. Police said the group sought to radicalize and recruit teenagers to carry out attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives.",
      "\"The plan was treated as a 'collective challenge' with the aim of gaining notoriety on social media,\" the police said.",
      "Authorities said they arrested two people in connection with the planned attack \u2014 the alleged leader of the group on illegal weapons possession charges in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a teenager on child pornography charges in Rio.",
      "The concert was the biggest show of Gaga's career.",
      "\"Tonight, we're making history,\" Lady Gage told a screaming crowd. \"Thank you for making history with me.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told CBS News the team learned of the alleged threats through media reports.",
      "\"Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks,\" the spokesperson said. \"Her team worked closely with law enforcement throughout the planning and execution of the concert and all parties were confident in the safety measures in place.\"",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show just after 10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \"Bloody Mary.\" Cries of joy rose from the tightly packed fans who sang and danced shoulder to shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show, which was funded by the city of Rio in an effort to revitalize the economy. In a recent report, Rio's City Hall said the show should bring in at least 600 million reais, or roughly $106 million.",
      "For Gaga, the performance was also an opportunity to promote her upcoming \"Mayhem Ball\" tour, featuring songs from her latest record MAYHEM. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 when it was released in early March and includes new hits like \"Abracadabra.\"",
      "Lady Gaga also performed a number of older classics at her free show Saturday, including \"Poker Face\" and \"Alejandro,\" switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans \u2014 many of them young \u2014 arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\"Today is the best day of my life,\" said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \"It's surreal to be here.\"",
      "Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year.",
      "The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Year's Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John's Day celebrations in June.",
      "\"It brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season \u2014 filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\" said Osmar Lima, the city's secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall's tourism department last month.",
      "Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028.",
      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio's metro employees danced to Lady Gaga's 2008 hit song \"LoveGame\" and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",
      "More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio's City Hall said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, traveled from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",
      "\"I've been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,\" said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga's outlandish costumes over the years.",
      "For her, the mega-star represents \"total freedom of expression \u2014 being who one wants without shame.\"",
      "Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna's show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year's Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state's security plan included 3,300 members of the military, 1,500 police officers and 400 firefighters.",
      "Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues.",
      "Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait.",
      "\"She's the best artist in the world,\" the 25-year-old said, as chants of \"Gaga, I love you\" in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him.",

The dress code of the 2025 Met Gala \u2014 typically related to the exhibit's theme \u2014 is \"Tailored for You,\" calling for a focus on suiting and menswear, according to the Met.

      "2024 Met Gala theme: \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\"",
      "In 2024, the Met Gala explored the themes of rebirth and renewal through nature and the passage of time. Referencing the 1962 J.G. Ballard short story \"The Garden of Time\" celebrities, entrepreneurs, athletes and designers wore floral gowns and referenced nature's everlasting forms.",
      "Bad Bunny wore Margiela and Jennifer Lopez wore a Schiaparelli design. Both co-chaired the event with Wintour, who wore a Loewe custom floor-length jacket adorned in feathers that formed tulip bouquets. But Zendaya, another gala co-chair, stole the night by walking the carpet twice. She first wore Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano before changing quickly and closing out the most public part of the night, the strut into the event at the steps of the Met, in a 1996 black gown from John Galliano's Givenchy era, which she paired with a flower bouquet Alexander McQueen head piece designed by Philip Treacy.",
      "2023 Met Gala theme: \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\"",
      "The Met Gala honored the late designer Karl Lagerfeld in 2023 with a night of references to his style and his immense influence in the fashion world. Some wore Lagerfeld's designs for Chanel, Fendi, Balmain and Chlo\u00e9, while others twisted his unique way of dressing, which combined black, white and leather for his daily wear, and later in life inspired the creative behind his eponymous label. There were also plenty of cat odes at the gala, a tribute to Lagerfeld's beloved feline friend Choupette,",
      "2022 Met Gala theme: \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\"",
      "The second installment of a two-part exhibition on fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion\" celebrated two centuries of American identity through fashion's eyes. \"Gilded Glamour\" graced the gala's red carpet and American history references were prevalent.",
      "The most recognized garment belonged to Marilyn Monroe. The nude, form-fitting number shined on the style icon while she serenaded then-president John F. Kennedy for his birthday in 1962. Kim Kardashian wore the dress after entering a deal with the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum to bring the garment out of its display. The uproar was immediate, as some alleged possible damage to the dress. Ripley's was forced to respond\u00a0denying the heated claims.",
      "2021 Met Gala theme: \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\"",
      "The first of two parts, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" wove together identities of the ever-changing U.S. through time, exploring the emotions behind the country's evolving culture. Instagram sponsored the event and brought to the carpet executives turned celebrities, including author, viral influencer and director of fashion partnerships at Instagram Evan Chen, and the social app's chief Adam Mosseri.",
      "After a pause for the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, social hesitance was still evident and masks were incorporated into some of the night's designs. Of note, Billie Eilish wore an Oscar De La Renta dress for a cause, calling for the storied house to end its ties to fur.",
      "2019 Met Gala theme: \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\"",
      "Guests brought their imagination to the pink carpet for the 2019 \"Camp: Notes on Fashion\" gala rendition. Gender-bending was evident\u00a0and many looks turned heads, like Jared Leto's interpretation of Alessandro Michele's world of Gucci. Lady Gaga's iconic Brandon Maxwell looks told a story of style with each step the singer took outside of the Met. Framed around Susan Sontag's 1964 essay \"Notes on 'Camp,'\" the gala brought to life the whimsical and effervescent nature of fashion.",
      "2018 Met Gala theme: \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"",
      "The 2018 Met Gala theme drew inspiration from Catholicism. \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\" explored religious iconography and the influence of medieval art in fashion. Guests brought to life looks that referenced papal garments and displayed biblical artifacts like crosses, angel wings and halos. The theme's ties to the history of Christ were not well received by some critics who thought fashion should stay out of the church.",
      "2017 Met Gala theme: \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between\"",
      "The 2017 event paid tribute to Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and her Comme des Gar\u00e7ons avant-garde designs that play with the body's shape and form. Duality, a motif for the exhibit, highlighted almost four decades of her work. Guests brought to the event pops of red from Kawakubo's palette, intricate embellishments and sheer fabrics. Caroline Kennedy and Rihanna embraced more fantastical designs, pairing shape-shifting silhouettes with florals, inducing more authenticity to a much-subdued theme interpretation.",
      "2016 Met Gala theme: \"Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology\"",
      "The influence of technology in fashion turned the 2016 Met Gala into a spectacular display of metallics and cutting-edge designs. Many of the garnmets appeared too intricate and precise to be man-made, an ode to the artisans all over the world who piece together exquisite Haute Couture creations by pouring thousands of hours into each work. CBS News spent the day with supermodel and entrepreneur Karlie Kloss, who wore a sleek white Brandon Maxwell number that referenced classic men's tailoring paired with Ala\u00efa-esque angular cuts.",
      "2015 Met Gala theme \"China: Through the Looking Glass\"",
      "While the 2015 Met exhibit scoped a wide history of artifacts and influence from Asian art, the gala came down to just one word: Rihanna. Dawning a sunny yellow cape that cascaded down the steps of the Met, the singer and fashion icon elevated the meaning of attending fashion's biggest night. The couture garment designed by China's Guo Pei took two years to make, Rihanna told Vanity Fair. The look quickly comes to mind around the world when the first Monday in May is discussed.",
      "2014 Met Gala theme: \"Charles James: Beyond Fashion\"",
      "The Costume Institute has been celebrating those behind fashion since its inception, and in 1973 it began hosting the gala within the museum itself, Vogue recounts. Fashion authority Diana Vreeland brought to life \"The World of Balenciaga\" after exiting Vogue as editor-in-chief, and her tribute to Spanish designer Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga left a blueprint for other designer-centered celebrations that followed.",
      "In 2014, couturier Charles James' work went on display at the Met and guests embraced brilliant gowns with his grandiose touch. James' tailored and structural approach to the female form, mixed with modern fabrics, brought elegance and regalia to the occasion.",
      "2013 Met Gala theme: \"Punk: Chaos to Couture\"",
      "Anti-establishment influence inked its way into the Met's\u00a0history in 2013.\u00a0Started in the 1970's, the punk movement gave guests a reason to wear garments embellished with the spirit of teen disobedience and air of grungy D.I.Y. personal style. Madonna honored the era with fishnets, metal studs and silver chains adorning a Givenchy mini plaid blazer by Riccardo Tisci. Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",
      "What was the first Met Gala theme?",
      "The Costume Institute started holding benefits in 1948, but it was Vreeland who brought themed galas to the next level as a Met consultant with \"The World of Balenciaga\" in 1973, according to Vogue.",
      "Full list of past Met Gala themes over the years",
      "Inspecting the art of the world's most famous designers and houses, declaring the impact of global cultures and movements, and defining the prevalence of certain style icons, the Met Gala has explored many themes throughout The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute history.

    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

      "Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, \"I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",
      "When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA \u2013 because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse.",
      "I asked, \"What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?\"",
      "\"He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,\" Alex replied.",
      "It was a famous last name he ran away from for years.\u00a0 \"I had a very grumpy relationship with it,\" he laughed. \"It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake.\"",
      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

      "Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, who served as the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA and played a key role in launching Operation Warp Speed \u2014 the Trump administration's effort to speed up the development of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The center has been operating with an acting director since Marks left the FDA in March.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad brings the kind of scientific rigor, independence, and transparency we need at CBER \u2014 a significant step forward,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary posted on X on Tuesday.",
      "Prasad has long criticized the FDA for granting emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine boosters, saying last year that Marks was \"either incompetent or corrupt to authorize a booster without clinical, randomized data.\"",
      "After Marks was forced out by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Prasad called Marks \"one of the most dangerous, pro-pharma regulators of the 21st century\" and a \"mediocre academic\" before joining the government.",
      "\"You could replace Peter Marks with a bobblehead doll that just stamps approval and you would have the same outcome at FDA with lower administrative fees,\" Prasad posted on March 20, the week before Marks was ousted.",
      "Prasad, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco. joins the agency at a time when the FDA says it is looking at whether it will approve annual updates to the COVID-19 vaccines this fall, as part of a routine process that had been due to start next month. Officials have floated the possibility of requiring new randomized trials before approving future updates to COVID shots.",
      "A week ago, Prasad said he backed the idea of new randomized clinical trials before approving COVID shot updates, calling it \"absurd\" that the U.S. was still offering COVID vaccinations to young children and warning that strain changes could result in changes to efficacy and safety.",
      "\"Without trials, it is only a matter of time before the FDA approves a vaccine that causes some bad outcome like vaccine-induced narcolepsy. If this happens, you can kiss faith in vaccines goodbye. You will see vaccine hesitancy like you have never seen before,\" he wrote.",

      "A spokesperson for the NIH did not comment on why NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sought the additional layoffs, referring an inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. An HHS spokesperson said that, after a review, the department had notified additional employees that they were \"also impacted\" by the layoffs plan announced in March.",
      "Fewer than 250 employees at the department received notices, the spokesperson said. An HHS official said that \"the same number of employees will be brought back in critical areas\" elsewhere at the department.",

In addition to levies on Chinese products, a baseline 10% tariff applies to all U.S. imports. Additional country-based duties \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are currently on hold for 90 days.",
      "\"Manufacturers are, on a day-to-day basis, dealing with the shock of tariffs on products and are very willing to invest in supply chains,\" Gordon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are looking at what it takes to onshore products, but it takes time and investment.\"",
      "Gordon added that she believes the tariffs amount to a \"baby tax on every parent across the country.\"",

For example, UPPAbaby, which makes car seats and strollers overseas, said in a statement\u00a0posted\u00a0on its website in an April that tariffs are making price increases \"unavoidable.\" Price hikes on some products went into effect May 5.",
      "An UPPAbaby car seat, for example, already costs $150 more than it did last month, according to Elizabeth Mahon, who owns Three Littles, a children's store in Washington, D.C. One of her most popular items, the UPPAbaby Vista stroller, now costs $1,199, up $300 from $899, she told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent in May.",

      "The rising cost of parenthood has some parents turning to resale platforms, boosting demand for discounted open-box goods or overstock inventory.",
      "Shraysi Tandon, founder and CEO of Kidsy, a re-commerce platform for baby and kids products, told CBS MoneyWatch that \"tariffs are wreaking havoc on families that were already squeezed to begin with.\"",
      "Tandon said she's witnessed a 25%-35% across-the-board hike in prices on baby equipment, including strollers, car seats, bouncers, carriers and other gear.",
      "\"Price hikes we thought would happen over the summer are already happening in real-time,\" she said, adding that the increase in costs doesn't jibe with the White House's call for families to have more children.",
      "\"If anything, people will get sticker shock and not want to have more kids at a time when many families are already experiencing inflationary pressures at checkout,\" she\u00a0said.",
      "Kidsy has seen a 70% spike in traffic over the past couple weeks, according to Tandon, as parents look for ways to save money.",
      "\"Resale and re-commerce is a strong signal to me that consumers are actively looking for discounted items, and ways in which they can save money on products that are essentials,\" she said.",

      "The conciliatory tone of Mr. Trump's post comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland.",
      "In a separate\u00a0post\u00a0Mr. Trump said China should open up its markets to the U.S. \"WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!!\" he\u00a0wrote\u00a0\"CLOSED MARKETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!!!\"",
      "The two nations, which trade billions in goods each year, have been in a tense stand-off since last month when Mr. Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports. China retaliated with a 125% levy on American goods.",
      "The upcoming talks in Switzerland represent the first publicly announced meeting between the two nations since the trade war began. A spokesperson for the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S. suggested in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Wednesday that the U.S. was the one to reach out and initiate talks.",

      "Last month, President Trump said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding trade, but a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson later\u00a0denied this, telling reporters that no negotiations had taken place.",
      "A deal would be a welcome sign for businesses that rely on Chinese imports to prop up their sales, and for American shoppers who have already started to see price hikes online.",

      "Steep new U.S. tariffs on imports are rattling businesses large and small, with many companies planning to absorb the higher costs by hiking prices for customers. Not footwear company Keen.",
      "Although the midsize company, based in Portland, Oregon, operates in an industry that is highly exposed to tariffs, Keen tells customers that it will keep prices steady this year no matter how tariffs affect its costs. That's no idle pledge calculated to preserve market share \u2014 Keen has been steadily retooling the business for years to protect itself from sudden shifts in global trade and the vagaries of geopolitics.",
      "\"We have been preparing for this for over a decade. Early on, we saw the risks of being overdependent on any one country, so we made the decision to diversify our supply chain well beyond China,\" Chief Operating Officer Hari Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 22-year-old company, with 650 U.S. employees and owned by design and brand management company Fuerst Group, has worked to reduce its dependance on Chinese manufacturing while expanding its U.S. presence and diversifying its supply chains.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are upending retailer supply chains, forcing them to devise workarounds. That can mean moving manufacturing to another foreign country with lower tariffs or investing in U.S.-based production. For small businesses, tariff-driven uncertainty\u00a0can mean shutting operations down altogether when the financials no longer add up.",
      "Shoe and clothing prices could soar",
      "Footwear companies are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval caused by President Trump's trade war given their reliance on China, where 36%, or $9.8 billion's worth, of imported footwear sold in the U.S. is made, according to a TD Cowen analysis of international trade data.",
      "For that reason, tariffs are expected to hit footwear and apparel companies hard, and that impact will be felt by American consumers as well, according to Jason Judd, a global supply-chain expert and executive director of Cornell University's Global Labor Institute.",
      "In 2023, U.S. households spent an average of about $1,700 per year on footwear and apparel, Judd said. He expects that figure to surge 70% in the short term, to $2,800 per family, because of tariff-related price hikes. In the coming years, meanwhile, consumers are still likely to be paying more for footwear and clothing because of higher global tariffs.",
      "\"That pain will lessen as terms and sourcing patterns change, but the longer-term costs per family will still be around a $425 increase per year.\"",
      "The abrupt change in tariff policies is already rippling across the industry. German sportswear giant Adidas last month warned U.S. customers that \"cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.\" And retailers across various industries, from apparel to food, have started passing some of the cost from higher import taxes to consumers in the form of\u00a0\"tariff surcharges.\"",
      "\"We saw the writing on the wall\"",
      "Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production. It also contracts with manufacturing partners in Cambodia, India and Vietnam, all of which are subject to impending new U.S. levies. Cambodia faces a country-specific tariff rate of 49%, while Vietnam and India face levies of 47% and 27%, respectively.",
      "\"We do have 10% exposure in those countries, but the 10% tariff we're dealing with is significantly lower than what other companies are facing on products that would come out of China,\" Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Back in 2015, executives at Keen were already taking note of rising labor costs in China. Today, the company's broad supply chain helps it spread costs across the company, its manufacturing partners and their suppliers, he said. Keen, which is privately held, declined to share information on its annual revenues.",
      "\"We are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, but that's shared by our partners,\" he said. \"They share some of the costs with us, then they go to the company they buy materials from, and those tier-one suppliers share some of the costs as well.\"",

      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\"",
      "The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",

      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump claims that other countries and exporters to the U.S. will largely pick up the cost of tariffs. Yet recent data shows that companies are moving to pass along those added expenses to American consumers, which may push up prices.",
      "For example, 76% of Texas manufacturers said they plan to pass tariff-related costs to consumers, while 50% say they will absorb costs internally, according to recent\u00a0survey data\u00a0from Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Large retailers have also warned that steep new levies on U.S. imports are likely to drive up prices.",
      "\"The bottom line is that inflation will be rising significantly over the next six months,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Indeed, with businesses having to plan months in advance to account for tariffs, many companies are baking those costs into their pricing. In a recent EY survey of over 4,000 executives, two-thirds of respondents said they might have to pass tariff costs on to customers.",
      "The Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute based in Washington, D.C., notes that the economic fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs will fall largely on low- and middle-income consumers. The levies could cost households an average of $5,200 every year,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Inflation ahead?",
      "Manufacturers expect their prices to increase 3.6% over the next 12 months, up from 2.3% in the last quarter of 2024, according to a recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, which cites manufacturers' concerns over trade.",
      "\"Nobody has the profitability to be able to eat the tariffs,\" David Loftus, CEO of the Electronic Component Industry Association, an industry trade group, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So the manufacturers pass to the distributors, who pass to the customers.\"",
      "A recent\u00a0Gallup poll found that nearly 90% of Americans expect tariffs to drive up prices this year. For now, tariffs have yet to budge prices \u2014 the Consumer Price Index in March\u00a0rose 2.4% on an annual basis, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Yet many experts say that U.S. tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to boost consumer prices in the months ahead.",
      "\"With the new tariffs now in place, we look for a shift up in inflation, adding a headwind to already slowing consumer activity and economic growth,\" Nationwide economist Daniel Vielhaber told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, which tracks consumer spending, to rise this year to 3.8%, up from 2.6% in March. Electronics and apparel are likely to see the sharpest price increases, according to the investment bank.",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump has staunchly defended the tariffs as a way to restore what he calls fairness to global trade, reinvigorate U.S. manufacturers and generate federal revenues. When asked in a May 4 interview on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0\"Meet the Press\" whether higher duties on imports will drive up prices, he replied, \"No. I think tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich.\"",
      "The president has also doubled down on his messaging that foreign exporters, not U.S. consumers, will absorb higher tariff costs. \"China probably will eat those tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said in an April 29\u00a0interview\u00a0with ABC News about the U.S. imposing tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has seemingly acknowledged that stepped-up tariffs could result in higher costs for some goods, such as toys. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said in an\u00a0April 30 Cabinet meeting. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"",
      "Some companies already hiking prices",
      "After Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of other nations, a flurry of companies across a range of industries have announced that they will increase prices to offset higher costs.",
      "For example, power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said in an April 30 earnings\u00a0call that they implemented a \"single-digit\" price increase on retail partners that month and that they're eyeing another price increase for later in the year.",
      "\"Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter,\" Chief Operating Officer Christopher Nelson said on the call.",
      "The CEO of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Old Spice, Tampax and other household brands, told CNBC\u00a0last month that price hikes are \"likely\" due to the uncertainty of tariffs. Adidas CEO Bjorn Goulden also told analysts in an April earnings call that there will be price increases in the U.S. market if U.S. duties on imported goods remain in place.",
      "\"So should the duties go away, again, there will, of course, not be price increases,\" he said. \"But I think we all agree that should these duties stay or even be higher, then, of course, it will cause a price increase in the market in general, not only in our category.\"",
      "Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu said in April that they planned to hike their prices, citing the U.S. eliminating a tariff loophole\u00a0for lower-cost goods. Relatedly, Temu has stopped shipping Chinese-made goods to customers in the U.S. following the May 2 expiration of the so-called de minimis exemption.",

At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted.",
      "At the same time, Powell noted there are concerns that the Fed could face a situation where its dual mandate is in tension, which could occur if inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike. In that scenario, the central bank would need to focus on which side of the mandate is the farthest from the Fed's goal, and prioritize taming that part of the economy, he added.",
      "\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make,\" Powell said. \"If the two goals are in tension \u2014 if unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way, and so is inflation \u2014 we would look at how far they are\" from the Fed's targets, and focus first on the economic issue that's under greater stress, he added.",
      "Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation, or a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.",
      "\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate \u2014 unemployment and inflation \u2014 because of tariffs,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"",
      "What the Fed decision means",
      "The Fed's to hold interest rates steady comes amid pressure from Mr. Trump to cut interest rates, with the president\u00a0writing\u00a0on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" for holding off on further reductions.",
      "The latest Fed statement offers no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"We continue to expect that, with tariffs likely to generate a modest slowdown in GDP growth to around 1.5%, the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged for all of this year,\" he said in a report.",
      "Economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. That could provide the Fed with the impetus to cut rates, although inflation\u00a0cooled in March.",
      "Given more subdued inflation and a buoyant job market, most economists had\u00a0projected\u00a0that the Fed would maintain interest rates at today's meeting, despite some headwinds such as eroding\u00a0consumer confidence\u00a0and a sharp decline in\u00a0first-quarter\u00a0U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"For the time being the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear,\" said Ashish Shah, CIO of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the Fed's announcement.",
      "Shah added, \"Recent better-than-feared jobs data has supported the Fed's on-hold stance, and the onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle.\"",

      "President Trump slammed Gavin Newsom on Tuesday just hours after the California governor asked for collaboration on a massive film tax credit.",
      "\"California built the film industry \u2014 and we're ready to bring even more jobs home.  We've proven what strong state incentives can do,\" Newsom's post on X said. \"Now it's time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again.\"",
      "His request came after the president announced over the weekend that he would impose 100% tariffs on all films produced outside the U.S. In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the nation's movie industry was \"DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since\u00a0experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels.",
      "Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit\u00a0from $330 million to $750 million.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday. A day earlier, during a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027, the president also talked about Newsom and Hollywood.",
      "He said the American film industry has been \"decimated\" by other countries and the \"grossly incompetent\" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to \"abandon\" the U.S. But he vowed that \"we'll get it back.\" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to \"make sure they're happy with\" the prospective tariffs.",
      "The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail\u00a0project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "\"A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?\" Mr. Trump said. \"That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage.",
      "\"And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,\" he said.",
      "He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California.",
      "\"I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,\"",
      "The president visited Los Angeles in late-January with the first lady, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. He was greeted by Newsom when he landed at the airport.",
      "\"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor.",
      "\"I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Top advisers have sent President Trump a plan to create a government-run investment fund, a request the president made earlier this year \u2014 but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal, CBS News has learned.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment.",

      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources with an aim to make returns that would provide a public windfall. Some of the best-known funds are financed by revenue from gas or oil, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. These funds can help insulate countries from swings in the value of natural resources, provide funds for government expenditures and allow future generations to benefit from current oil and gas revenue.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that directed the Treasury and Commerce secretaries, in close coordination with the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett, to draft a plan for the sovereign wealth fund within 90 days.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the stablecoin bill advanced out of the committee with the caveat that improvements would be made before it was brought up for a floor vote. But Republicans moved ahead without addressing Democrats' concerns on provisions involving anti-money laundering, national security and consumer protections, Gallego said.",
      "\"I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to force us to vote for it,\" Gallego told MeidasTouch in an interview posted Wednesday.",
      "\"You can't try to f*** us and then say, hey, deal with it,\" Gallego added. \"That's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes.\"",

      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",
      "The bill is cosponsored by 10 other Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who were the original cosponsors of the GENIUS Act.",
      "On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, will hold a roundtable with crypto experts to highlight the GENIUS Act's \"serious risks\" to the U.S. economy.",
      "The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",
      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "After nearly 20 years of delays, the Real ID deadline is finally here. Beginning May 7, Americans planning to travel domestically are required to use the enhanced form of identification. The Transportation Security Administration said it will no longer accept IDs that don't comply with Real ID requirements.",
      "The TSA said it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints, meaning roughly four out of five travelers are showing up with a Real ID-compliant driver's license or\u00a0another valid form of identification.",
      "If you still need to update your ID, you're not alone.\u00a0CBS News data shows that dozens of states are behind on compliance. You can still travel without a Real ID, but will need to bring another acceptable form of identification, as outlined by the TSA.",
      "Here's what you need to know as the Real ID requirements takes effect on Wednesday.",
      "What is a Real ID?",
      "The Real ID is a federally compliant license, learner permit or nondriver ID card issued by state driver's license agencies. You can tell if a state-issued license or ID card is a Real ID if it has a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "The symbol might look slightly different depending on the state from where it's issued: California, for example, puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Who needs a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are required for those over 18 who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification, unless they want to bring a valid U.S. passport.",
      "When will I need to use a Real ID?",
      "Americans will need to show Real IDs to access certain federal facilities \u2014 including TSA checkpoints \u2014 enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).",
      "Am I required to get a Real ID?",
      "Real or Enhanced IDs are only required for those over 18 without a valid U.S. passport who plan on flying domestically or entering a federal building that requires identification.",
      "That's said, Real IDs are considered a more secure form of identification than a classic driver's license.",
      "The requirement for Real IDs was established by Congress in 2005, following the 9/11 Commission's recommendation that the Federal Government \"set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver's licenses,\" according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, although some states started issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009.",
      "You can find more details on Real ID on the DHS' website.",
      "Can I use an Enhanced ID instead of a Real ID?",
      "Five states \u2014 Washington, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Vermont \u2014 issue what is called an\u00a0Enhanced Driver's License\u00a0(EDL), or Enhanced ID. This is considered an acceptable alternative to a Real ID card.",
      "Whereas Real IDs have a star emblem, Enhanced IDs have an image of the U.S. flag in the top right corner or the word \"Enhanced\" at the top of the card.",
      "Both Real IDs and Enhanced IDs are federal documents that allow holders to fly domestically.",
      "Enhanced IDs also allow you to travel from the U.S. to Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, without a passport \u2014 something you can't do with a regular Real ID.",
      "How much does a Real ID cost?",
      "Prices vary by state. In\u00a0New York, for example, there is no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the normal transactional cost you pay for a standard license, ID or renewal. Pennsylvania, however, charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees. New York charges an additional $30 fee for Enhanced IDs.",
      "It's best to check your state's Real ID guidelines for an accurate estimate of how much you'll pay. The same goes for Enhanced IDs.",
      "How do I get a Real ID? Can I apply for one online?",
      "Each state has a driver's licensing agency that issues Real IDs. To find out how to apply where you live, visit the DHS website and click on your state of residence for specific instructions. DHS recommends that you visit your state's driver's licensing agency website to find out exactly what documentation you'll need to brings in order to obtain a Real ID.",
      "Be sure to plan ahead as some states have longer wait times for DMV appointments.",
      "What if I am planning to travel this week but I don't have a Real ID yet?",
      "A TSA spokesperson told CBS News Philadelphia that if travelers show up to the airport next Wednesday without a Real ID they may still be able to fly, but getting on board the plane may take longer than usual. The transportation agency recommends that people without a Real ID arrive at the airport three hours early to ensure enough time to get through security.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog.",
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has sought to trim the federal workforce through a combination of layoffs and so-called deferred resignation. Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla,\u00a0said\u00a0on the electric vehicle maker's April 22 earnings call that DOGE's efforts \"in addressing waste and fraud\" will \"get the country back on track.\"",
      "The IRS has been a focus of DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, with plans to trim as much as 40% of its workforce this year. Through March, those efforts have resulted in the tax agency losing about 11% of its workforce, the May 2 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found.",
      "But revenue agents \u2014 the IRS workers who perform audits \u2014 have seen a much bigger hit, with 31% of those workers, or about 3,600 auditors, taking either the deferred resignation plan or getting fired in the first three months of 2025, the report found. Losing a large share of auditors could impact the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue, given that these agents typically handle cases involving wealthy taxpayers or corporations, experts say.",
      "\"You lose the very staff trained to keep high-end taxpayers and corporate tax payers in compliance,\" noted Emily DiVito, senior adviser on economic policy at the left-leaning Groundwork Collaborative and a former policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS.",
      "She added, \"You can see some behavioral effects when taxpayers, especially those that really don't want to pay their bills, come to accept there is very little risk to not paying at all, or even filing.\"",
      "Reached for comment, a Treasury spokeswoman said, \"The Biden Administration grew the IRS from 79,431 to 102,309 personnel. Under new leadership, approximately the same number of employees have left the IRS, with a vast majority leaving voluntarily through the Deferred Resignation Program. The roll back of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges, and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improve both efficiency and quality of service. The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about the TIGTA report.",
      "While the TIGTA report didn't explain why auditor departures outpaced that of overall cuts at the IRS, the tax agency had made an effort under the Biden administration to hire more auditors in order to beef up revenue collection. In February 2024, the IRS had said it expected to collect hundreds of billions in additional taxes after using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act to hire more auditors.",
      "Because the DOGE cuts have focused on firing so-called \"probationary workers,\" or junior federal employees who typically have less than a year or two on the job, there may have been more newly hired auditors who were impacted by the reductions, DeVito said.",
      "Reducing federal revenue?",
      "Auditing wealthy Americans and corporations can be lucrative for the federal government. In fiscal year 2023, auditors recommended an additional $32 billion in tax assessments, the TIGTA report said.",
      "And every $1 spent on auditing the top 0.1% of earners can return about $26 in tax revenue, according to an analysis from Better IRS, an advocacy group for free tax filing.",
      "The cuts to the IRS' auditing force raises questions about the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue, DeVito added.",
      "The combination of individual and corporate income taxes provides about 60 cents for every $1 in federal revenue, with the remaining 40 cents coming from payroll taxes and fees, such as paying admission to national parks, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "DOGE's cost-cutting efforts may end up costing almost as much as they've saved, according to an analysis last month from the nonpartisan research group the Partnership for Public Service.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $165 billion, but the Partnership for Public Service estimates that the savings have come at a cost of $135 billion due to paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity. That figure also excludes the impact of multiple lawsuits filed against DOGE's actions, as well as lost tax revenue due to IRS cuts, the group said.",
      "The IRS could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"The argument from DOGE is to save money \u2014 that if we don't have as big of a federal workforce, then we are saving the government money,\" DeVito said. But given the potential to lose out on tax revenue, the IRS reduction \"simply doesn't make sense,\" she said.",

      "\"When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,\" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. \"And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees.\"",
      "Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream.",
      "About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs.",
      "During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone.",
      "Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold.",
      "He says that makes him feel \"really bad\" and \"angry.\"",
      "\"China is not paying these tariffs,\" Arnold said. \"We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted.\"",
      "The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May.",
      "Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile.",
      "\"We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,\" Kamler   said. \"And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair.\"",
      "Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective.",
      "\"I can't even calculate that high,\" Kamler   said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. \"I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.' So, you can take that (as) kind of (an) example\u2026I mean, a $100-bicycle here would be a $1,000 if all the parts were made here right now.\"",

      "In a social media post Tuesday night, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. confirmed the Switzerland meeting, writing that China \"has decided to agree to engage with the\u00a0#US\u00a0side.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Bessent said he will meet with a Chinese team on Saturday and Sunday, and initial discussions will likely be about \"de-escalation, not about the big trade deal.\" The Treasury secretary said the U.S. and China have \"shared interests\" because the sky-high tariffs imposed by both countries last month are not \"sustainable.\"",
      "\"The world has been coming to the U.S., and China has been the missing piece,\" Bessent said on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\"",
      "Hours before the U.S.-China meetings were announced, Bessent told lawmakers in a hearing that the U.S. had \"not engaged in negotiations\" with China yet.",
      "China and the United States have been locked in a tense tariff standoff in recent weeks, threatening to upend relations between the world's two largest economies and imperil more than a half-trillion dollars in annual trade between the two countries.",
      "President Trump hit China with 145% tariffs on many goods last month, part of a wider swath of steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of U.S. trading partners that Mr. Trump has accused of unfair practices. China later retaliated with 125% tariffs on imports from the United States. And while Mr. Trump paused many of his reciprocal tariffs in the hope of striking new trade deals with other countries, he left the China tariffs in place.",
      "The escalating trade war has led to weeks of stock market turbulence, and sparked fears of slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "Mr. Trump \u2014 who has cast his tariff strategy as a way to boost U.S. manufacturing and cut trade deficits \u2014 has suggested at various points that he's open to striking deals with U.S. trading partners, though he said earlier Tuesday, \"We don't have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us.\"",
      "In an interview with NBC News last week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, but pushed the Trump administration to drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first.",
      "When asked about China's request to end tariffs before negotiations start, Bessent told Fox News he's \"not going to give away our strategy\" but \"everything's on the table.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 19:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

    "story": [
      "Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people.",
      "They're not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News, his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom \"there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.\" So employees have to \"resurrect\" them \u2014 affirm that they're living, so they can receive their benefits.",
      "Revivals were \"sporadic\" before, and there's been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Martin O'Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. \"In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they're very much alive,\" he said.",
      "It's more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead \"impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.\"",
      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to soon receive the first group of White South African refugees it says deserve a safe haven in the U.S. because of alleged racial discrimination in post-Apartheid South Africa, government documents obtained by CBS News show.",
      "The initial arrival of the South African refugees could happen as early as next week, according to the documents, which describe the effort as a \"stated priority\" for the Trump administration. Officials have planned a Monday press event at Dulles International Airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents show, although sources familiar with the effort told CBS News the timing of the plan could change.",
      "In February, President Trump issued an executive order directing officials to use the U.S. refugee program to resettle Afrikaners, an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands.",
      "The president claimed that Afrikaners faced \"government-sponsored race-based discrimination,\" citing a law that U.S. conservatives, like South African-born Elon Musk, have said allow racially motivated seizures of land owned by White South Africans. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination.",
      "The hastily arranged initiative to welcome Afrikaners stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration's move to ban most other refugees from entering the U.S.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions after returning to the White House was suspending the American refugee admissions program, stranding thousands of approved refugees who had been identified as vulnerable individuals fleeing violence and persecution in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.",
      "Federal courts have ruled against Mr. Trump's plan to shutter the refugee program, which Congress created in 1980 to offer refuge to those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion or political views. A federal judge recently ordered officials to resettle the approximately 12,000 refugees who were ready to travel to the U.S. when the refugee program was paused in January.",
      "The processing of Afrikaner refugees has also been unusually fast. Before Mr. Trump's second term, the State Department said the refugee process, on average, took between 18 to 24 months to complete due to background checks, medical screenings and other interviews. The Afrikaners ready to travel in the U.S. have gone through that process in a matter of months or even weeks.",
      "While the State Department's long-standing program to assist refugees during their first months in the U.S. has been halted due to Mr. Trump's actions, his administration has instructed resettlement officials to use Department of Health and Human Services funds to aid the Afrikaners.",
      "The government documents show resettlement officials were told they can use funds administered by HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement to help Afrikaners secure housing, household items and basic necessities during their first 90 days in America, including \"groceries, weather-appropriate clothing, diapers, formula, hygiene products, and prepaid phones.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Office of Refugee Resettlement is using \"existing infrastructure and funding\" to offer \"immediate support\" to Afrikaners.",
      "\"Initial arrivals are expected in the near term, with additional individuals anticipated over the coming months,\" the department said. \"(The Office of Refugee Resettlement) is coordinating closely with federal, state, and local partners to ensure these refugees receive the services needed to safely and successfully integrate within our country.\"",
      "In a statement, the State Department said the American embassy in Pretoria, South Africa has been interviewing those who have applied for resettlement to the U.S. under Mr. Trump's directive to welcome Afrikaners and that it continues to receive inquiries.",
      "\"While we are unable to comment on individual cases, the Department of State is prioritizing consideration for U.S. refugee resettlement of Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination,\" the department added.",

      "The announcement of Steiner's appointment, which drew immediate concerns from postal unions over possible efforts to privatize the USPS, was made Friday by Amber McReynolds, chairperson of the USPS' Board of Governors, during a meeting of the independent group that oversees the service.",
      "\"We anticipate that Mr. Steiner will join the organization in July, assuming his successful completion of the ethics and security clearance processes that are currently underway,\" McReynolds said.",
      "Friday's announcement by the the Board of Governors comes as President Trump and his adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have raised the idea of privatizing the nearly 250-year-old Postal Service, which has faced financial challenges amid a changing mail mix and other issues.",
      "The choice of Steiner has been seen by the postal unions as a harbinger for possible privatization of some or all of the venerable quasi-public institution, which is largely self-funded and has a mission to serve every address in the country \u2014 nearly 167 million residences, businesses and post office boxes.",
      "Postal unions have held protests throughout the country over potential privatization, job cuts and possibly ending the universal service obligation.",
      "Brian L. Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said Steiner is not just any executive from the private sector but someone who sits on the board of one of the Postal Service's top competitors.",
      "\"His selection isn't just a conflict of interest \u2014 it's an aggressive step toward handing America's mail system over to corporate interests,\" Renfroe said in a statement. \"Private shippers have been waiting to get USPS out of parcel delivery for years. Steiner's selection is an open invitation to do just that.\"",
      "Renfroe's union represents 205,000 active city letter carriers and around 90,000 retirees.",
      "Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents more than 220,000 USPS employees and retirees, likened the appointment of Steiner to a fox guarding a hen house.",
      "\"FedEx has a very different agenda than the public postal service. And they're a major competitor of the United States Postal Service,\" he said. \"I'm not talking about any attributes of an individual, but to me, that's the last type of person you will put in charge of the public institution as the anchor of the mailing package industry in the country.\"",
      "Steiner, who will leave the FedEx board, said in a written statement that he admires the public service mission of the USPS and called it \"an incredible honor to be asked to lead the world's greatest postal organization.\"",
      "\"I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch,\" said Steiner, who served as CEO of Waste Management Inc. from 2004 through October 2016.",
      "In a written statement, McReynolds called Steiner \"the right person to lead the Postal Service at this time to ensure this magnificent and historic organization thrives into the future.\"",
      "\"Dave is a highly regarded leader and executive with tremendous vision, experience and skill that can be applied to the long-term mission and business needs of the Postal Service,\" she added. \"Our Board looks forward to working with Dave as he takes on the core mandates of providing universal and excellent service for the American public and doing so in a financially sustainable manner.\"",
      "The Postal Service is in the midst of a 10-year modernization and cost-cutting plan that began in 2021 under Postmaster Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March. The plan is an attempt to stop losses at the agency, which has a budget of about $78 billion a year and is mostly self-funded, including through stamps and packages.",
      "Known as \"Deliver for America,\" the initiative has received markedly mixed reviews. While postal officials contend it has led to major efficiency improvements, some members of Congress have criticized it for leading to mail delays, unsustainable postage increases and declines in business.",
      "Besides privatization, there's also been talk of possibly moving the USPS under the control of the U.S. Department of Commerce.",

      "Trump administration funding cuts and a loss of federal workers who help support wildland firefighting continues to make planning for the upcoming wildfire season a challenge, according to forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon.",
      "The biggest issue they're facing is a lack of communication from the federal government as the West faces \"a pretty significant wildland fire season,\" Washington State Forester George Geissler said Thursday during a press conference hosted by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.",
      "\"This is the time when we make certain that we have the aviation we need, when we have the personnel we need and that all of our systems check out and are ready to go when the alarm bell rings,\" he said. \"Without knowing what our partners are doing or not having a clear understanding of what actions are being taken, we struggle with missing the third leg of the stool that we have.\"",
      "The Forest Service workforce was cut in February during Elon Musk's push to reduce federal spending\u00a0as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, known as\u00a0DOGE. At least 1,000 National Park Service workers were let go. A court order to rehire fired workers, along with a public outcry brought many workers back to their jobs, but Murray and fire officials say it wasn't enough. Plus, the lost of experienced, trained workers set the process back.",
      "\"We're hearing that don't worry, we are going to hire frontline people,\" Murray said. \"You just let a whole bunch of frontline people go.\"",
      "\"Funding is not in jeopardy\"",
      "A spokesperson with the Department of Interior, which oversees National Parks and other public lands, said \"funding is not in jeopardy.\" They're supporting firefighting efforts by increasing pay for federal and tribal wildland firefighters across the U.S.",
      "The administration has refused to release the exact number of fired and rehired workers, but numbers are coming in from individual forests, she said.",
      "\"I've heard of at least 35 people at Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, 46 at Okanagan-Wenatchee, 21 at Colville, 15 at Gifford-Pinchot, and more at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Olympic National Forest and Methow Valley,\" she said. \"Here's the thing, nearly every single Forest Service employee supports fire operations in some capacity.\"",
      "Fire Chief Leonard Johnson, with the McLane Black Fire Department in Washington state, said they may line up aviation support and heavy equipment, but it takes trained firefighters to put the fires out.",
      "\"We have a high reliance on that workforce out there,\" he said. \"Not only at the local level, at the state level, but at the federal level to make our wildfire season successful to deal with those large fires. People are the critical component in all of this.\"",
      "National Forest workers reduced by thousands",
      "Merkley said Trump's budget proposal cuts forest and watershed management programs that improve forest conditions, eliminates a collaborative forest landscape restoration program and slashes 2,000 National Forest positions, on top of the thousands who left through early retirement, buyouts and layoffs.",
      "Most of those workers may not have the title \"firefighter\" but they all hold Red Cards - which shows they have special training to provide essential frontline support to firefighting crews, Murray said.",
      "\"In fact, around three quarters of forest service workers are trained in wild land firefighting,\" she said. \"They provide crucial surge capacity when a crisis strikes.\"",
      "Trail maintenance crews ensure the paths are clear for firefighting personnel and equipment, Murray said. Biologists conduct testing to make decisions about prescribed burns and fuel reduction planning.",
      "\"We are here today to pull the fire alarm, and we're gonna set off some sirens,\" she said. \"We're going to keep focused on this, and we are gonna keep pushing back. There is just too much at stake to do anything less.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0A federal judge is holding a bail hearing Friday for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate who was detained by immigration authorities after the Trump administration revoked her student visa.",
      "Ozturk is currently detained at an immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana, where she was transferred after she was taken into custody in Massachusetts in March. The bail hearing in her challenge to her confinement comes after a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with a district court's order to transfer Ozturk to immigration custody in Vermont.",
      "Ozturk is appearing remotely from Louisiana and is testifying before the court. During the proceedings, and while her doctor was testifying about Ozturk's asthma diagnosis, a lawyer appearing alongside her in Louisiana said Ozturk was suffering from an asthma attack, and she was briefly excused for 10 minutes.",
      "One of Ozturk's lawyers said that she faces \"significant health risks\" if she remains in detention and urged U.S. District Judge William Sessions, who is presiding over the case, to immediately grant her bail.",
      "Allowing her to remain in custody shows that \"you can be detained thousands of miles from your home for more than six weeks for writing a single news article,\" her attorney told the court.",
      "Ozturk alleges that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights. She is among the several hundred international students attending American universities who have had their student visas revoked after they were accused of criticizing Israel or participating in pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys said that an immigration judge denied bond for the Turkish national during a hearing last month after they asked an immigration judge to release her as her immigration case proceeds.",
      "Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to Ozturk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa.",
      "The immigration judge, Ozturk's attorneys said, denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\"",
      "Ozturk was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities outside her Somerville, Massachusetts, residence on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration. She was not informed about the revocation before she was detained, her lawyers said.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" according to court filings.",
      "Ozturk had co-authored an opinion piece that was published in the Tufts' student newspaper last year that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed did not mention Hamas.",
      "Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release, writing that the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "After Ozturk was taken into custody, she was transferred to New Hampshire and then Vermont, where she was kept overnight before putting her on a plane to Louisiana. The 30-year-old student has been detained at an immigration facility in Basile since late March.",
      "In a court filing by Ozturk, she said that she has suffered multiple serious asthma attacks in ICE detention and has received limited medical attention at the Louisiana detention center. She said that she is one of 24 people in a detention cell that has a sign stating the room has a capacity for 14.",
      "During Friday's bail hearing, Ozturk said she has suffered 12 asthma attacks since she was detained in late March, which have become \"longer and harder to stop.\" Four of them occurred since Ozturk disclosed her history to the court in a declaration last week, she said. There are \"constant triggers\" that can bring on an attack, including the room conditions at the facility in Louisiana, limited access to the outdoors and stress from her confinement, Ozturk said.",
      "\"It is affecting me in a very negative way, alongside other women living here, not accessing enough medical care and medication,\" she said.",
      "If she is released while her case is adjudicated, Tufts will provide Ozturk with housing, she said. Ozturk can continue working toward completion of her doctorate if she is let out of detainment, she told the court.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts in the hours after she was taken into custody kicked off a battle over where her habeas petition should be filed and whether federal district courts even have the authority to consider the challenge. While initially filed in court in Massachusetts, a judge there transferred her case to Vermont, given that Ozturk was in the state at the time her lawyers filed her habeas petition.",
      "The Justice Department, however, has argued that the case should proceed in Louisiana, as that is where Ozturk is confined. They have sought, unsuccessfully so far, to have her challenge to her detention tossed out.",
      "Sessions, who sits on the federal district court in Vermont, ruled last month that Ozturk had to be transferred from Louisiana to ICE custody in Vermont. Separate from her bail hearing, the judge will weigh the merits of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit to block it. But the three-judge panel rejected the request and said federal immigration authorities had to transfer Ozturk to Vermont, as Sessions ordered them to do.",
      "\"Permitting Ozturk's transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, address concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution of this matter \u2014 all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed expeditiously,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan said in their unanimous opinion. \"At stake, too, is Ozturk's ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House is expected to send Congress a rescissions package in the coming days, looking to claw back congressionally approved funding amid a broader effort to dramatically slash spending.",
      "As the administration faces legal challenges to its efforts to slash the U.S. Agency for International Development, public broadcasting\u00a0and other programs, the White House is looking to Congress to formalize the process and put it on a stronger legal footing.",
      "Here's what to know about rescission:",
      "What is the rescission process?",
      "The rescission process is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent, rendering the funds no longer available to departments, agencies and offices. Those funds can then be redirected elsewhere or sent to the Treasury general fund.",
      "Congress has the power of the purse under the U.S. Constitution, and each year, lawmakers approve funding to keep the federal government running. Those funds are then dispersed throughout government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds, or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The distinction was made under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which established a mechanism for clawing back funding and was intended to stop presidents from unilaterally freezing previously appropriated funds. The law requires the president to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation in most cases.",
      "Only discretionary funds can be rescinded. Mandatory spending, like Social Security and Medicare, cannot be.",
      "How does the rescissions process work?",
      "To kickstart the rescission process, the White House's Office of Management and Budget submits a formal rescission request to relevant committees in Congress, and the panels have 25 days to act on the package. It would then go to the House and Senate floors for expedited votes.",
      "Overall, Congress has 45 days to act on the rescission request. And rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the Senate. Instead, they only require a simple majority to pass.",
      "What leaders in Congress have said about a rescissions package",
      "Congressional Republicans are generally optimistic about the process \u2014 and eager to get started.",
      "\"I'm anxiously awaiting a rescissions package,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a recent Axios event.",
      "Johnson said it's his expectation that Congress will pass a rescissions package for fiscal year 2025. And asked about going back in 2026, Johnson said \"I'll go back as many times as the president will send us a rescissions package.\"",
      "\"We have to reduce spending. I mean, it should even be a partisan proposition \u2014 it's something every American has to support,\" Johnson said.",
      "Asked by reporters about the timing of the package, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said on May 6 that he had not heard from the White House on when a rescission request would be transmitted, though he said the White House had previously outlined what could be in it.",
      "\"There's a lot of wasteful Washington spending, and people at home want to make sure we get rid of it,\" Barrasso said. \"A rescissions package is one way to deal with some of it.\"",
      "What's expected to be targeted within an initial rescission package",
      "The White House package is expected to ask Congress to cancel around $9 billion, seeking to make permanent some of the spending that Elon Musk and Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency have slashed in recent months.",
      "The recission package would likely be only a fraction of the cuts, with an expected focus on foreign aid money from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, along with funding for major public broadcasting systems, including NPR and PBS. But the final product remains to be seen, and could pose hurdles for passage in narrowly held Republican majorities in the House and Senate.",
      "Sen. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican, said on Fox News in May that Musk and DOGE did the \"hard part\" by identifying the \"wasteful spending.\"",
      "\"Now Congress has to do the easy part and claw that back and make those cuts permanent,\" Banks said.",
      "Banks called the initial rescission package \"really simple,\" while saying that he's \"getting frustrated\" because of a lack of urgency around the package.",
      "\"This is just the first $9 billion \u2014 if we can't cut $9 billion, how are we going to cut $150 billion?\" Banks said.",
      "When have rescissions been approved before?",
      "Rescission has frequently been used in Congress to reallocate unspent funds. But requests from the White House come less frequently.",
      "Since 1974, presidents have proposed nearly $92 billion in cuts through rescission packages, of which nearly $25 billion were accepted by Congress, according to the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Congress approved $1.2 billion in cuts proposed by President Gerald Ford, $2.1 billion by President Jimmy Carter, $15.6 billion by President Ronald Reagan, $2.3 billion by President George H. W. Bush and $3.6 billion by President Bill Clinton. Neither former Presidents George W. Bush nor former President Barack Obama utilized rescission packages.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday it would take months to fully resolve the air traffic control problems plaguing Newark Liberty International Airport, with normal operations unlikely to resume until summer.",
      "\"It's going to take a little time. I hope by the summer we're going to be fully functioning,\" Duffy told \"CBS Mornings\" as he announced a major overhaul of the nation's aging air traffic control system.",
      "The plan includes new software, updated equipment and the first new ATC centers since the 1960s amid growing concerns about nationwide system reliability following massive delays and cancellations at Newark.",
      "Duffy explained that both primary and backup communication lines at Newark failed, contributing to the disruption. He added that some air traffic controllers had stepped away from duty due to stress, and new personnel were being trained.",
      "\"Our main mission is safety. If there's any concern with safety, we slow down traffic, and there might be delays or cancellations,\" Duffy said. \"We take those precautions to make sure that you get from your departure city to your arrival city.\"",
      "The secretary expressed alarm about outdated equipment throughout the system.",
      "\"This system that we use, much of the equipment you have to buy on eBay. No one makes it anymore. That's how old the system is that we fly on today,\" Duffy said. \"When you have the failings, you look at the whole system, and could other parts have issues? Of course.\"",
      "The modernization initiative will require significant funding, with the House already allocating $12.5 billion. But Duffy said the total cost would be much higher.",
      "\"It will be tens of billions of dollars to do this,\" he said.",
      "Duffy wants Congress to provide all the money up front and cut through red tape to speed up the project. He said both Republicans and Democrats back the plan.",
      "\"This is one that everyone agrees on, Republicans and Democrats,\" Duffy said. \"All of our families fly.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 10:36:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter was a steady member of the high court's liberal wing during his tenure despite being appointed by a Republican president.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, who was a steady member of the high court's liberal wing during his tenure despite being appointed by a Republican president, died Thursday. He was 85.",
      "The Supreme Court said Souter \"died peacefully\" at his home.",
      "\"Justice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. \"After retiring to his beloved New Hampshire in 2009, he continued to render significant service to our branch by sitting regularly on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for more than a decade. He will be greatly missed.\"",
      "Appointed in 1990 to replace Justice William Brennan, Souter was a little-known judge on the U.S. appellate court in Boston when he was selected by then-President George H.W. Bush for the nation's highest court. He served on the Supreme Court for nearly 20 years, often frustrating Republicans during his tenure as he consistently joined with the liberal members of the court.",
      "Souter stepped down from the Supreme Court in 2009, creating the first vacancy for then-President Barack Obama to fill. He was succeeded by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who made history as the first Hispanic member of the high court and whose appointment did not change the ideological makeup of the high court.",
      "Born in Melrose, Massachusetts, on Sept. 17, 1939, Souter was an only child. He graduated from Harvard University in 1961 and spent two years as a Rhodes scholar at Magdalen College at Oxford. Souter received his law degree from Harvard in 1966 and began his legal career at the private firm Orr & Reno in Concord, New Hampshire.",
      "Souter left private practice to become assistant attorney general of New Hampshire in 1968, followed by deputy attorney general in 1971 and attorney general of New Hampshire in 1976. He then served as an associate justice on the New Hampshire Superior Court and was appointed in 1983 to the state Supreme Court by then-Gov. John Sununu.",
      "Souter's career on the federal bench began in May 1990, when Bush tapped him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit. He was a judge on the 1st Circuit for only three months before Bush nominated Souter for the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed Souter as the 105th justice by a 90-9 vote, and he joined the high court on Oct. 8, 1990.",
      "Souter had been described as a \"stealth\" candidate, given that he had not authored many controversial opinions and did not have a lengthy paper trail. Sununu, who was Bush's chief of staff and recommended Souter for the Supreme Court, said he\u00a0would be a \"home run\"\u00a0for conservatives.",
      "But Sununu's prediction that Souter would be a conservative justice proved incorrect. Souter joined\u00a0Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer in allowing the narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions.",
      "He also co-authored the 1992 majority opinion with O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy that reaffirmed Roe v. Wade's central holding that the Constitution recognizes the right to abortion, but set out a new standard for determining when government restrictions are allowed.",
      "Less than 15 years after Souter's retirement, a more conservative Supreme Court would go on to\u00a0overturn the landmark Roe decision\u00a0and effectively\u00a0end the use of affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions.",
      "Souter  also was among the four justices who\u00a0dissented\u00a0from the 2000 decision in Bush v. Gore and said the Supreme Court should not have stopped Florida's recount in the presidential contest.",
      "\"There is no justification for denying the state the opportunity to try to count all disputed ballots now,\" Souter wrote in a dissenting opinion.",
      "Souter returned to New Hampshire after retiring from the Supreme Court but continued to hear and decide cases on the 1st Circuit. Notably, he\u00a0joined a 2019 decision\u00a0from the Boston-based appellate court upholding Massachusetts' ban on certain semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.",
      "In 2020, Souter was part of a\u00a0unanimous decision\u00a0finding that the Justice Department during President Trump's first term lacked authority to condition federal law enforcement grants on state and local governments' assistance with deporting migrants suspected of entering the country unlawfully.",

    "summary": "The group of House and Senate Democrats say Trump's designation of Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations unlocks legal tools that will help address the flow of U.S.-made guns across the border with Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of House and Senate Democrats is urging top Trump administration officials to use the recent designation of Latin American cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations to take action to curtail the flow of American-made guns across the southern border.",
      "The 14 Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pam Bondi that the designation unlocks additional legal tools that would allow the administration to disrupt the cartels' financial networks and impose harsher penalties on entities that provide material support to them.",
      "Federal law makes it a crime, subject to fines and up to 20 years in prison, to knowingly provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. Entities that provide weapons, money, equipment or other support to those groups can face federal prosecution if found liable.",
      "\"If you want to really tackle the fentanyl trade, you have to tackle the source of the power of the people who are involved in that trade, and there's no way to do that without addressing the guns that they receive from American-made manufacturers and dealers,\" Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who led the letter, told CBS News. \"It's a choice I would say, which is you can't actually successfully dismantle the cartels without also dismantling the gun trafficking that goes southward that allows them to send the fentanyl trafficking northward.\"",
      "The Democrats urged the Departments of Homeland Security, State and Justice to take \"immediate\" steps to stem the flow of firearms manufactured in the U.S. into Mexico by boosting interagency cooperation to dismantle smuggling rings that facilitate gun trafficking; expanding inspections at border crossings; increasing law enforcement efforts against straw purchased and gun dealers that provide material support to smugglers; and bolstering intelligence-sharing between the U.S. and Mexican authorities and other partners to target weapons traffickers.",
      "\"This steady supply of weapons coming in from the north has allowed these criminal organizations to gain control over fentanyl and human trafficking across the border and undermine Mexican law enforcement,\" they wrote in the letter. \"Put simply, if we do not stop the flow of American-made guns across the southern border to Mexico, we cannot stop the flow of fentanyl into our country over that same border.\"",
      "Goldman said the Justice Department should initiate investigations into gun makers and dealers to determine whether they're knowingly distributing and selling guns to drug cartels, either directly or through straw purchasers.",
      "\"The fact that there is an intermediary does not mean that there isn't a criminal conspiracy that they are a part of, and that the DOJ needs to use this new foreign terrorist organization-designation to apply more pressure on the gun industry to stop the flow of American guns to the cartels,\" he said.",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\"\u00a0Nearly half of all firearms recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Mexico, meanwhile, has just one gun store in the country and stringent firearms laws.",
      "An investigation from CBS Reports exposed how Americans are helping Mexican drug cartels smuggle weapons across the U.S.-Mexico border. Guns are purchased by straw purchasers in the U.S., and a network of brokers and couriers then transport them across the border and into Mexico. U.S. intelligence documents and interviews with current and former federal officials revealed that the federal government has known about the weapons trafficked by cartels for years, but has done little to stop the networks that operate in the U.S..",
      "In an effort to combat the violence wrought by drug cartels, the Mexican government filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in 2021 against seven of the biggest U.S. firearms manufacturers and one wholesaler. Mexico is seeking $10 billion in damages from the gun industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "Firearms manufacturers, though, are seeking to block the suit because of a federal law that shields them from liability for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether Mexico's suit can proceed, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sought to use the suit as leverage in trade negotiations with President Trump after his administration designated drug cartels as terrorist groups and threatened earlier this year to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican imports.",
      "Mr. Trump agreed in February to a 30-day pause on the tariffs on Mexican imports after speaking with Sheinbaum. Mexico's president said at the time that the U.S. government is \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "Goldman, who served as lead counsel in the first impeachment investigation of Mr. Trump before he was elected to Congress, said dismantling drug cartels to stop the trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs into the U.S. is a shared goal with the administration and should bring collaboration.",
      "\"One component of doing that has got to be stopping the Iron River streamline of American guns going into the cartel's hands,\" he said.",
      "Goldman introduced legislation in the last Congress that aimed to strengthen border security by curbing the trafficking of U.S.-made guns and ammunition across the southern border and said he is working to re-introduce the bill in the current Congress.",
      "Joining Goldman on the letter are: Senators Ben Ray Lujan and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Representatives Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Eric Swalwell of California, Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island, Lou Correa of California, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Jill Tokuda of Hawaii, Nellie Pou of New Jersey, Timothy Kennedy of New York and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration must soon make a decision that will affect millions of Americans' ability to access and afford mental health and addiction care.",
      "The administration is facing a May 12 deadline to declare if it will defend Biden-era regulations that aim to enforce mental health parity \u2014 the idea that insurers must cover mental illness and addiction treatment comparably to physical treatments for ailments such as cancer or high blood pressure.",
      "Although a federal parity law has been on the books since 2008, the regulations in question were issued last September. They represent the latest development in a nearly two-decade push by advocates, regulators, and lawmakers to ensure insurance plans cover mental health care equitably to physical health care.",
      "Within the dense 166-page final rule, two provisions have garnered particular attention: first, that insurers provide \"meaningful benefits\" \u2014 as defined by independent medical standards \u2014 for covered mental health conditions if they do so for physical conditions. For example, if insurers cover screening and insulin treatment for diabetes, then they can't cover screening alone for opioid addiction; they must also cover medications to treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Second, insurers must go beyond the written words of their policies to measure how they work in practice. For example, are patients having to seek out-of-network care more often for mental than physical care? If so, and it relates to an insurer's policies, then those policies must be adjusted.",
      "In January, a trade association representing about 100 large employers sued the federal government, claiming the regulations overstepped the administration's authority, would increase costs, and risked reducing the quality of care. The ERISA Industry Committee represents several Fortune 500 companies, such as PepsiCo and Comcast, which sponsor health insurance plans for their employees and would be directly affected by the new regulations.",
      "ERIC's lawsuit, filed days before President Trump's inauguration, puts the onus on the new administration to decide whether to defend the regulations. If it chooses not to, the rules could be scrapped.",
      "Mental health clinicians, patients, and advocates are urging the administration to fight back.",
      "\"What we're trying to do is make the spirit of parity a practical reality,\" said Patrick Kennedy, a Democratic former U.S. representative who sponsored the 2008 parity law in the House and co-founded the Kennedy Forum, which advocates on mental health issues. This is \"an existential issue for the country, public health, for every aspect of our society.\"",
      "A 2023 national survey found that more than 6 million adults with mental illness who wanted treatment in the past year were unable to receive it. Cost was one of the most common barriers.",
      "This lack of treatment harms people's physical health too, with research suggesting that undertreating depression can complicate chronic conditions, such as diabetes.",
      "Kennedy hopes that connection will prompt support from the Trump administration, which has made chronic disease a central focus of its \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda.",
      "\"You're never going to get MAHA if you don't integrate mental health,\" Kennedy said, mentioning the broad health movement embraced by his cousin HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "But James Gelfand, president and CEO of ERIC, said the regulations are a misguided attempt to solve the nation's mental health care crisis.",
      "People's difficulty accessing therapy or medication has less to do with insurance policy and more to do with a severe shortage of mental health care providers, he said, adding, \"No amount of penalties on employers\" or new parity regulations \"is going to change that dynamic until we get more of these providers.\"",
      "This point is at the heart of debate about parity issues. Is mental health care difficult to access because there are few providers, or are providers not accepting insurance because of low reimbursement rates? A recent study by the research institute RTI International suggests it has more to do with payment.",
      "The departments of Justice, Labor, and Health and Human Services declined to comment for this article. The Treasury Department, which is also involved in the lawsuit, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"They bank on you just giving up\"",
      "Psychiatric nurse practitioner Gabrielle Abelard employs about 40 clinicians in her therapy practice, which serves about 2,500 clients across Massachusetts each year.",
      "One of the programs she's most proud to offer is intensive in-home therapy for children with serious behavioral challenges, such as intergenerational trauma, aggressive outbursts, and self-harm. Two clinicians visit the child's home over months and work with the family, the child's doctors, and school staff.",
      "\"A big part of the work being done is helping to keep children in school, helping to keep them out of the hospital and even out of jail,\" Abelard said.",
      "But insurance barriers sometimes hinder the services.",
      "Abelard's staff has to obtain prior authorization from insurers before they can provide care. Then they have to reapply for authorization every two, three, or six months, depending on the insurer. When that reauthorization is delayed, Abelard faces a dilemma: continue seeing clients knowing insurers may not pay for those services or leave clients without care until the reauthorization comes through.",
      "Continuing services has cost her tens of thousands of dollars, she said, and months of bureaucratic hurdles to obtain back payments from insurers.",
      "\"They bank on you just giving up,\" she said.",
      "A goal of the landmark 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was to decrease dilemmas such as Abelard's.",
      "But the bipartisan law primarily emphasized easy-to-measure treatment limits, saying insurers could not impose higher deductibles or copays for mental health care than they did for physical health care. What received less attention was how insurers should handle other limitations, such as prior authorization or fail-first requirements for patients to try certain therapies before they would be eligible for others.",
      "As a result, true parity remained elusive, said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney at the nonprofit Legal Action Center.",
      "In 2020, Congress tried to address this through a new law, signed by Mr. Trump in his first term. The law required insurance plans to systematically analyze differences in certain treatment limitations for mental and physical health care and submit those analyses upon request to states and the federal governments.",
      "As the federal government reviewed some of those analyses, it discovered numerous parity violations. In a 2022 report, it detailed how some insurance plans covered nutritional counseling for diabetes, but not for anorexia or bulimia. Another plan required precertification for all outpatient mental health and addiction services but only for a select few outpatient medical and surgical services.",
      "The regulations issued in September aimed to provide insurers more guidance on the 2020 law and close loopholes that allowed such disparities, Steinberg said.",
      "\"Supply is the biggest problem\"",
      "One of the biggest changes in the new regulations was the focus on outcomes, such as how often patients go out of network for mental versus physical care.",
      "Steinberg called the provision \"a really important change.\" But Gelfand, president of the employer association suing to stop the regulations, said it ignores the complexity of mental health care.",
      "Many factors outside employers' and insurers' control affect how often a patient goes out of network, he said, including the availability of providers in the area, regional variations in clinical practices, and the patient's personal preference.",
      "Mental health clinicians know there's high demand for their services, so they have a lot of market power. That \"is creating the bad behavior from these providers,\" Gelfand said, such as refusing to accept insurance and not submitting out-of-network bills on clients' behalf.",
      "\"Supply is the biggest problem,\" Gelfand said.",
      "However, the RTI International study challenged that premise, with the authors noting that primary care physicians are in shorter supply than behavioral health providers yet have much lower out-of-network use.",
      "The authors point to insurance reimbursements as the culprit instead. The study found that insurance reimbursements for behavioral health visits are, on average, 22% lower than for medical or surgical office visits. The low pay creates a disincentive for psychologists and psychiatrists to join insurance networks.",
      "But the fix may not be as easy as raising reimbursement rates. Companies are already paying increasingly high premiums for employees' health insurance and many are concerned about sustaining these benefits.",
      "ERIC has championed other strategies, such as reforming medical education and residency programs to produce more mental health care providers, increasing telehealth services, and training primary care doctors to address basic mental health concerns. The organization often lobbies state and federal lawmakers, writes letters to regulatory agencies, and testifies before Congress on these issues.",
      "Narrowly focusing on insurance regulations could have unintended consequences, Gelfand said. Increased costs for health plans may get passed on to consumers. Or, in an attempt to keep costs down, insurers may narrow the size of their physical health care networks to match the mental health ones. In a worst-case scenario, employers could stop providing mental health benefits altogether.",
      "Advocates say that's unlikely, since many employees have come to expect this type of coverage, and employers recognize that providing mental health benefits can increase worker productivity and retention.",
      "Patrick Kennedy also pointed to the bigger picture around these issues: If people do not have insurance coverage for mental health care, they're more likely to end up in crisis at the hospital or in the criminal justice system, he said. Their children may be sent to foster care. Taxpayers finance those systems.",
      "\"We all end up picking up the tab for not enforcing parity,\" he said.",
      "But what calculation the Trump administration makes \u2014 and whether it defends or drops the new regulations \u2014 remains to be seen.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 23:27:36 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The president said in remarks from the Oval Office that the two countries are \"affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade.\"",
      "The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs \u2014 and the threat of the levies \u2014 as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.",
      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",
      "A social media post from Mr. Trump said the framework will raise $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers and producers, and strengthen national security for both the U.S. and the U.K.",
      "\"This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" the post said, teasing that there are \"many more to come.\"",
      "Starmer's office said the prime minister would give an \"update\" about U.S. trade talks later in the day.",
      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",
      "\"They're offering us concessions?\" Mr. Trump remarked to reporters. \"I hope so. ... They do want to make a deal very badly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said that his leverage in talks would be U.S. consumers, but he appeared to suggest that the U.K. would also start buying more American-made goods.",
      "\"I think that the United Kingdom, like every other country, they want to ... go shopping in the United States of America,\" he said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week that the administration is moving forward with \"all deliberate speed\" to reach agreements with 17 trading partners. He said he anticipates \"agreements in principle,\" and after they're reached, the administration \"will paper them over\" in the coming months.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his Oval Office remarks that there are \"numerous deals\" in the works. Bessent is set to travel to Switzerland on Thursday for a trip that will include a meeting with Chinese officials. The president said he is open to speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping after the meeting.",
      "A trade deal with the U.S. is one of several that Starmer's government is seeking to reach. On Tuesday, Britain and India announced a trade after three years of negotiations. The U.K. is also trying to lift some of the barriers to trade with the European Union imposed when Britain left the bloc in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Thursday he will replace interim U.S. attorney Ed Martin, his controversial pick to be the top prosecutor in the District of Columbia.",
      "Mr. Trump later named Fox News host Jeanine Pirro to the role.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that Martin appeared to lack enough support in the Senate needed for confirmation and he hoped to find another place for him at the Justice Department. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said Tuesday that he would not vote to advance Martin's nomination to the full Senate.",
      "\"I was disappointed. A lot of people were disappointed, but that's the way it works sometimes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He wasn't rejected, but we felt it would be very, it would be hard. And we have somebody else that we'll be announcing over the next two days who's going to be great.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Martin will remain at the Justice Department as associate deputy attorney general and pardon attorney, a key role that typically advises the president on how to use his clemency power. The president said Martin will also serve as director of the Justice Department's \"Weaponization Working Group,\" a committee formed by Attorney General Pam Bondi to \"review\" the department's Biden-era activities, including its investigations into Mr. Trump, Capitol rioters and others.",
      "Martin, a \"Stop the Steal\" activist, was appointed to the post on an interim basis and can serve until May 20. In the role, he oversaw a purge of prosecutors who worked on criminal cases stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Tillis said his concerns about Martin were related to the Capitol riot, adding that he has \"no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on Jan. 6, and that's probably where most of the friction was.\"",
      "\"If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. attorney for any district except the district where Jan. 6 happened, the protests happened, I'd probably support him,\" Tillis said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said earlier this week that Tillis' opposition indicated that Martin likely wouldn't advance out of the Senate Judiciary Committee.",

      "More than a year after New York Attorney General Letitia James won a half-billion dollar civil fraud case against President Trump, the Justice Department under Mr. Trump has launched a criminal fraud probe targeting James, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation.",
      "U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York John A. Sarcone III told the Albany Times-Union that the investigation was \"being handled at this time by main [Department of] Justice and the Albany FBI field office.\"",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "The investigation began after William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleging that James \"has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte claimed James received deals on mortgage terms by falsifying information related to multiple properties, over the course of decades. The allegations include listing a home in Norfolk, Virginia as her \"principal residence\" despite living and working in New York, buying a five-family property in Brooklyn with a loan that is only available for homes with four units or less, and an accusation that, in 1983, James' father signed mortgage documents stating they were husband and wife.",
      "James has denied the allegations, calling them \"baseless.\" James' office on Thursday declined to comment.",
      "Abbe Lowell \u2014 an attorney for James whose firm frequently represents clients that it believes have been unfairly targeted by the Trump administration \u2014 has also derided the investigation.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Lowell called the allegations \"baseless and long-discredited\" and said that the investigation \"appears to be the political retribution President Trump threatened to exact that AG Bondi assured the Senate would not occur on her watch. If prosecutors are genuinely interested in the truth, we are prepared to meet false claims with facts.\"",
      "Last month, Lowell sent a letter to the Department of Justice refuting the allegations laid out in Pulte's letter. In a letter to Bondi, Lowell called the allegations \"long-disproven\" and the investigation, \"the latest act of improper political retribution \u2014 this time directed at Ms. James \u2014 publicly instigated and endorsed by President Trump.\"",
      "In February 2024, a New York judge ordered Mr. Trump, his company and two of his adult sons to pay the State of New York about $364 million. The figure, with interest accumulated over more than a decade, currently totals more than $500 million. Trump has appealed the ruling.",
      "The ruling came after a lengthy civil trial in which James' office accused Mr. Trump of spearheading an effort to use fraudulent property valuations and estimates of Mr. Trump's net worth to obtain favorable loan rates and insurance deals he wouldn't otherwise have gotten received.",
      "The figure Mr. Trump was ordered to pay reflected the judge's calculation of how much Mr. Trump and his company benefited through the scheme.",
      "Mr. Trump has long raged against the case, and James \u2014 even suing her unsuccessfully in an effort to stop her fraud investigation before a suit could be filed by the state.",
      "Mr. Trump was forced to take the stand in November 2023 during the trial, lashing out at James during his hourslong testimony, and calling the fraud case \"a terrible, terrible thing.\"",

      "\"Yes, I do,\" Biden said. \"Because look, I was in charge and he won, so I take responsibility.\"",
      "Biden went on to defend his record in office, blaming Mr. Trump for tanking a bipartisan border security bill\u00a0last year. The former president conceded he should have done more to \"advertise\" his agenda, including accomplishments that he said could bear results years after he left office.",
      "Biden says he could've defeated Trump \u2014 and wasn't surprised by Harris' loss",

      "He denied allegations that his cognitive abilities had faded in office, saying, \"there's nothing to sustain that\" and arguing he accomplished a lot in the final months of his term. Biden conceded that he had a \"bad, bad night\" during his debate with Mr. Trump, but argued polls still only showed him trailing Mr. Trump by single digits.",
      "He also pushed back on reporting that after dropping out of the race, he privately urged Harris not to break with him. The former president said he \"did not advise her\" to say in an October appearance on \"The View\" she couldn't think of any differences between her and Biden, and claimed the line \u2014 which was heavily used in Trump campaign ads \u2014 was misinterpreted.",
      "Biden lashes out against Trump",

When asked why Mr. Trump remains \"fixated\" on him, Biden said, \"I beat him,\" referring to Biden's 2020 election victory.",
      "Biden brushed off Mr. Trump's claim that the pardons issued by Biden \u2014 including to his family members \u2014 are \"void\" and \"vacant\" because they were allegedly signed with an autopen.",

    "summary": "A three-judge panel permanently blocked Alabama from using a state-drawn map that they said flouted their directive to draw a plan that was fair to Black voters.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges ruled Thursday that Alabama intentionally diluted the voting strength of Black residents when it drew congressional lines, and said the state must continue using a court-ordered map that led to the election of the state's second Black congressman.",
      "A three-judge panel permanently blocked Alabama from using a state-drawn map that they said flouted their directive to draw a plan that was fair to Black voters. The decision was not a surprise because the panel ruled against the state twice previously and put a new map in place for last year's elections.",
      "The judges said that the map drawn by the Alabama Legislature in 2023 violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, just like the one previously drawn by the state.",
      "\"The long and short of it is that the 2023 Plan unlawfully dilutes Black voting strength by consigning it to one majority-Black district,\" the judges wrote, adding that Alabama should have a second district with a substantial percentage of Black voters.",
      "The judges chided what it called Alabama's \"deliberate decision to ignore\" their order to draw a second district where Black voters had an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choosing. \"The Legislature knew what federal law required and purposefully refused to provide it, in a strategic attempt to checkmate the injunction that ordered it,\" they wrote.",
      "The Thursday ruling came after a February trial over the state map.",
      "\"Today's decision is a testament to the persistence and resilience of Black voters in Alabama, including our clients,\" said Deuel Ross, deputy director of litigation at the Legal Defense Fund. \"Alabama's unprecedented defiance of the Supreme Court and the lower court orders harkens back to the darkest days of American history.\"",
      "In the Supreme Court's June 2023 decision in Allen v. Milligan, the 5-4 court declined to further weaken the landmark law, and instead affirmed a lower court opinion that found it substantially likely that Alabama's map violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The decision had come as a surprise as the high court has weakened the Voting Rights Act in recent years, first in 2013 and then in 2021.",
      "Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall's office did not immediately issue a comment on the decision. The state is expected to appeal.",
      "Judges scheduled a hearing on plaintiffs' request to again make Alabama subject to the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act.",
      "The long-running case began in 2021. Black voters and civil rights groups sued over Alabama's congressional map. Black residents account for about 27% of the state's population but were the majority in just one of the state's seven congressional districts. The lawsuits accused Alabama of packing Black voters into a single majority-Black district and splintering other Black communities to limit their influence elsewhere.",
      "A panel made up of three federal judges said\u00a0in September 2023 that Alabama should have two districts where Black voters have an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. Because of racially polarized voting in the state, that map would need to include a second district where Black voters are the majority or \"something quite close,\" the judges wrote.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 17:21:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A recent dip in overdose deaths\u200b has been credited in part to wider naloxone access.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting a $56 million grant that teaches first responders how to use the lifesaving overdose reversal drug naloxone, which experts say could reverse progress the United States has made in lowering opioid overdose deaths.",
      "A recent dip in\u00a0overdose deaths has been credited in part to wider naloxone access. The medication was made\u00a0available for over-the-counter purchase in 2023 and is\u00a0standard for first responders to carry. It's even popped up\u00a0in some classrooms.",
      "Naloxone, also sold under the brand name Narcan, is available in injectable and nasal spray form. It is an opioid antagonist that attaches to receptors in the brain, reversing and blocking the effects of other opioids, including fentanyl.",
      "The grant money can be used by state and local organizations for training people on how to use naloxone, as well as administering and distributing the medication. Grantees are expected to establish protocols to refer patients to treatment or support services and provide other safety information about illicit drugs and overdoses. The grant is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "\"While some skeptics may think that naloxone - and harm reduction more generally - enable people, there is decades of research that show giving people the information and tools they need helps keep people safe,\" medical anthropologist Jennifer Syvertsen said in an emailed statement. \"Naloxone simply enables people to breathe.\"",
      "Wider cuts could \"dismantle essential services\"",
      "The proposed cut comes as the Trump administration proposes cutting $33.3 billion from the Health and Human Services budget in 2026,\u00a0according to the Associated Press. The cuts would eliminate SAMHSA, the AP\u00a0reported in March.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who referenced his\u00a0history of heroin addiction\u00a0during his confirmation hearings, has proposed that the administration be absorbed into a new office. HHS has also\u00a0faced mass layoffs.",
      "These combined cuts could \"dismantle essential services,\" Hanna Sharif-Kazemi, the federal policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, told CBS News. The DPA is a non-profit agency based in New York City that seeks to reduce overdose deaths with harm reduction and evidence-based methodology.",
      "\"We believe it's going to exacerbate the overdose crisis at a time when nearly 90,000 people died from overdoses last year,\" Sharif-Kazemi said.",
      "The loss of federal funding, Sharif-Kazemi said, can exacerbate the budget issues that state and local agencies already face.",
      "\"Without federal funding, states may be forced to reduce essential services in other sectors, like health care, education and public safety, or they would fail to compensate for the loss in overdose prevention funding, which would put more lives at risk,\" Sharif-Kazemi said. \"Those cuts to overdose prevention programs are going to undermine proven strategies that we know save lives.\"",
      "How can the federal government support overdose prevention efforts?",
      "During his second term, Mr. Trump has focused on fentanyl entering the United States. He has enacted tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico with the goal of making the countries fight fentanyl trafficking. Little fentanyl enters the U.S. over the northern border. Precursor chemicals, or the ingredients for fentanyl and other illicit drugs, are largely manufactured in China and shipped overseas, usually to Mexico. The fentanyl is then produced, typically in Mexico, and brought to the United States for distribution.",
      "Sharif-Kazemi said the best way to build on the progress made in reducing overdose deaths is to continue and even expand federal funding for overdose prevention efforts. That could include expanded access to naloxone, she said, as well as better access to medication-assisted treatment, which Trump has previously pushed for, and the expansion of rehabilitation facilities. It could also include more funding for harm reduction strategies, like testing strips that allow people to check if drugs are contaminated with fentanyl.",
      "Recent years have also seen a push for overdose prevention centers, where people who use drugs can do so under the supervision of trained medical professionals. Those medical professionals can then monitor the drug users, and administer naloxone or other medications if necessary. OnPoint NYC operates two such sites in New York City. The organization said in January\u00a0that its staff have reversed over 1,700 opioid overdoses since November 2021.",
      "\"We know the 90,000 people that we lost to overdose last year were denied the care and support they needed,\" Sharif-Kazemi said. \"These are all tools that we know actually can save people's lives. Ultimately, if the Trump administration was really worried about making sure that people entered recovery, we need to make sure they stay alive and are able to actually enter recovery.\"",

      "President Trump announced Thursday that his administration wants to replace the technology at thousands of air traffic control sites across the country and build six new coordination centers. Mr. Trump called into a news conference that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy was holding to unveil the plan for a new air traffic control system.",
      "\"After decades of originally \u2014 and we're taking about a long time ago \u2014 reliable service, air traffic control is long overdue for, not an overhaul really, for a remaking,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's got to be brought up to a modern standard.\"",
      "The president also said he was confident that the current system remains \"extremely safe\" ahead of the summer travel season.",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration wanted to replace the technology at more than 4,600 air traffic control sites and build six new air traffic coordination centers. Officials said the plan also called for buying 25,000 new radios, replacing over 600 radars and installing 4,000 new high-speed network connections.",
      "A coalition of aviation industry groups said that the plan required a minimum of about $30 billion. Last week, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed a proposal that would spend $12.5 billion on improving the air traffic control system. The aviation coalition said Thursday that at least $18.5 billion in additional emergency funding would need to be spent on improvements over three years. Duffy told reporters the final number would be up to Congress, which is currently controlled by Republicans.",
      "\"It's going to be billions, lots of billions,\" said Duffy, who was a congressman representing Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019.",
      "Duffy also said the administration believes implementing the plan would take up to four years.",
      "The proposals come months after January's deadly midair collision between an Army helicopter and a commercial airliner over Washington, D.C., which is under investigation. Duffy was asked if the proposals could have prevented the collision.",
      "\"This is different,\" Duffy said. \"It could have had an impact in saving lives \u2026 We had 85 near-misses at DCA (Reagan National Airport), and I think all the airline CEOs would tell you, all of industry would tell you this was dangerous, and we should have seen that it was going to cost lives if we don't stop cross-traffic in the D.C. area. Now it's my job to say, what other risks do I see?\"",
      "The announcement comes as Newark Liberty International Airport  in New Jersey continues to deal with disruptions following an outage last week. Air traffic controllers directing flights into Newark lost communications and their screens went blank for about 90 seconds on April 28.",
      "\"We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are,\" one controller was heard saying on a recorded transmission.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said the outage lasted about 30 seconds, and it took another 30-60 seconds for planes to reappear on controllers' screens.",
      "Duffy spoke about the outage during Thursday's event, saying that the main communication line went down and a backup line didn't switch on. He said the incident was an example for why the system needs to be modernized.",
      "\"If we don't actually accomplish the mission that we're announcing today, you will see Newarks not just in Newark, you'll see Newarks in other parts of the country because it's an aging system,\" Duffy said.",
      "Several controllers went on trauma leave in the wake of the outage, which appears to at least in part be due to a fried copper wire. There have also been more than 4,000 delays and over 1,000 cancellations in and out of Newark.",
      "In an interview before Duffy's announcement, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told CBS News he fully supports upgrading the air traffic control system.",
      "\"I'm not saying that the working conditions are acceptable, and I think that the controllers do an amazing job in terms of managing,\" Bastian said in an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Bastian said it's safe to get on an airplane, but he also said the air traffic control system can't operate in its current form for much longer.",

Documents from the local investigation \u2014 along with many records from a separate FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives since the late 1980s. ODNI said some of the records that were published Wednesday had previously been handed over to the Los Angeles Police Department.",
      "Letter from RFK Jr. to former Attorney General Eric Holder",
      "Among the newly published documents is a letter Kennedy Jr. wrote in 2012 to then-Attorney General Eric Holder, asking for Holder to reopen the investigation into the assassination.",
      "Kennedy Jr. wrote in his letter that he was writing in support of a request to investigate made by Paul Schrade, \"a close friend and advisor to my father. He was standing beside my father when Daddy was killed and Paul was himself wounded by a bullet.\"",
      "Kennedy Jr.'s request focused on an audio analysis of the shooting that purported to suggest 13 shots fired, more than the eight rounds in Sirhan's handgun. this would offer proof there was a second gunman. The request includes an analysis that concluded, \"due to the poor quality of the recording (high background noise, distance of the microphone from the shooting source, initial recording made on a low grade recorder), an absolutely exact number of shot-sounds could not be determined.\"",
      "FBI probed leads ultimately deemed not credible",
      "FBI memos released Wednesday include some that described investigations into at least four people accused of having prior knowledge of the assassination: A person who claimed to have predicted the assassination, somebody who claimed to know about a co-conspirator, a person who claimed Sirhan had offered him $1 million to kill Kennedy, and somebody who burst into a congressional office and claimed that he'd given the orders to kill Kennedy.",
      "Many of these and other allegations were not treated as credible, and some of the people making the claims were described in the documents as unreliable.",
      "Sirhan went to a gun range two days before the assassination",
      "One FBI memo reveals Sirhan was surveilled in January 1968. It is unclear why, but there's no indication from the memo that the FBI developed concerning intelligence from the surveillance.",
      "The records lay out some details of the days and hours leading up to the assassination. The wife of a gun store owner identified Sirhan as among a group of people who on June 1, 1968 request information about \"armor-piercing ammunition,\" before Sirhan purchased ammo from the store.",
      "A staffer at a gun range told FBI agents that on June 4, 1968, the day before the shooting, he encountered a man he later identified from a photo as Sirhan. The man fired at targets with high accuracy and purchased ammunition, the staffer said. A woman with him also practiced shooting and was described as blonde and muscular.",
      "Statements from eyewitnesses",
      "Many of the documents detailed authorities' interviews with eyewitnesses, people who said they knew Sirhan and employees and guests at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where Kennedy was shot.",
      "One witness said that on the night of the killing, Sirhan expressed anger toward rich people and said he thought that other people at the event were disdainful of him.",
      "Hours before the shooting, the witness said he met a man he later believed to be Sirhan outside the Ambassador Hotel, and chatted with him about Kennedy's presidential campaign.",
      "Sirhan ostensibly said, of Kennedy: \"Don't worry about him if he doesn't win, that son of a bitch, he's a millionaire and he doesn't need to win. H\u0435 just wants to go to the White House, but even if he wins he's not going to do anything for you or for me or for any of the poor people.\"",
      "Sirhan was \"disgusted\" with Kennedy and believed he was trying to \"buy the presidency,\" according to the witness.",
      "What did last month's RFK files say?",
      "The government released a trove of 10,000 records on Robert F. Kennedy last month. A\u00a0CBS News review\u00a0found the documents included handwritten notes from Sirhan \u2014 including ones in which Sirhan wrote \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" \u2014 as well as FBI memos on Sirhan, crime scene and autopsy photos, witness interviews and other materials.",
      "A few of those records make reference to common conspiracy theories about the assassination, including mentions of witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him.\" Other witnesses said they didn't see anybody matching that description.",
      "Many of the details in those files were already publicly known.",
      "Who killed RFK \u2014 and what has RFK Jr. said?",
      "Sirhan was convicted of killing Robert F. Kennedy \u2014 then a Democratic presidential primary candidate \u2014 at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He was 24 years old when he was arrested shortly after the shooting. Sirhan has\u00a0admitted\u00a0to killing the senator at various points, sometimes claiming it was due to the senator's support for Israel, though at other times, Sirhan has said he is innocent or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan has been incarcerated in California for decades, and multiple requests for parole have been unsuccessful. The state's parole board\u00a0endorsed his 2021 bid for parole, but California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0rejected the request.",
      "The case has drawn public fascination for decades, with some observers\u00a0claiming\u00a0Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or acted as part of a wider conspiracy. They often cite conflicting eyewitness testimonies or the alleged presence of extra bullets \u2014 though many others have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",
      "One of the skeptics is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated. He has\u00a0argued\u00a0Sirhan wasn't responsible for the killing, and met with him in prison before backing his 2021 request for parole.",
      "However, other members of the Kennedy family have\u00a0staunchly opposed\u00a0Sirhan's release from prison.",

    "story": [
      "The big announcement that President Trump teased earlier this week in the Oval Office is a \"most favored nation\" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, sources told CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration previously sought to implement the \"most favored nation\" idea during Mr. Trump's first term, tying some high-cost Medicare drugs administered by health care providers to \"the lowest price that drug manufacturers receive in other countries.\"",
      "Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that in the coming days, he'd reveal \"a truly earth-shattering and positive development for this country and for the people of this country.\"",
      "\"The President will make a big and historic announcement on Monday. Until then, everyone can keep guessing!,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Court orders sought by the drug industry and others blocked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from implementing the proposal in Mr. Trump's first term, saying that the government failed to go through the proper rulemaking steps to create and implement the policy, which was finalized in late 2020.",
      "\"While there's nothing unlawful per se about rushing to enact policy in the final days of a presidential administration (indeed, it's a time-honored tradition), executive branch officials may not circumvent clear legal requirements in the eleventh hour to achieve goals they couldn't accomplish in the normal course,\" a federal judge in California ruled in 2020.",
      "The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022, blaming court orders blocking the model and concerns raised by stakeholders, including fears that it could cut off some Medicare beneficiaries from drugs and strain providers.",
      "Mr. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning on Tuesday, pointing to higher prices in Europe for the blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic. The drug is also used for weight loss under a different brand name, Wegovy.",
      "\"Right now the big impediment is really price. And we're negotiating that with the drug companies and seeing if we can at least launch some pilot programs, or if we can get the price low enough, we can make it available at government cost to everybody,\" he said in an interview with Newsmax.",
      "Kennedy defended a decision by the Trump administration last month not to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid, scrapping a proposal touted by the Biden administration. The Trump administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare under talks launched by the Biden administration, but only for its uses to treat diabetes and other health conditions.",
      "While drugs like Ozempic are \"miracle drugs in many ways,\" Kennedy warned that their cost was prohibitively expensive.",
      "\"If we made that so that Medicaid, Medicare paid for it, and that private insurance companies had to pay for it, we would double the cost of health insurance to most employers in this country. And that would really be destructive,\" he said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to clear the way for it to end a program that allowed more than 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States.",
      "The request for emergency relief arose from a case challenging Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke a grant of parole that had been extended by the Biden administration to migrants from the four countries through a special parole program. The 532,000 people who were temporarily protected from deportation through the program, known as CHNV, were set to lose their legal status April 24.",
      "A federal district court judge halted the secretary's March notice, finding that the Immigration and Nationality Act did not give Noem the discretion to terminate parole en masse for the 532,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans. Instead, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled that there had to be individualized decisions to end parole.",
      "A federal appeals court declined to allow Noem to move forward with the termination of the CHNV program, and the Trump administration has now filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court.",
      "In its request, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said that the district court did not have jurisdiction to enter its order because federal immigration law leaves parole-termination decisions to the discretion of the Homeland Security secretary. Sauer said the district court lacked the authority to \"usurp the Executive Branch's control of foreign policy and immigration.\"",
      "\"In doing so, the district court engaged in the very review Congress prohibited \u2014 needlessly upending critical immigration policies that are carefully calibrated to deter illegal entry, vitiating core Executive Branch prerogatives, and undoing democratically approved policies that featured heavily in the November election,\" he wrote.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security created special parole programs for certain nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuelan in late 2022 and early 2023. The Biden administration had said that the policy promoted legal immigration and dissuaded migrants from crossing the southern border.",
      "Under the CHNV program, 532,000 migrants were allowed to enter the U.S. after securing a sponsorship from individuals based in the U.S. After entering the country, the migrants were granted parole and could then work legally in the U.S. for two years.",
      "But the parole program was paused when President Trump returned for his second term in the White House. The policy was part of several others implemented in an effort by the Trump administration to crack down on immigration. Many aspects of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda have been challenged in federal court and temporarily blocked.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in March that beneficiaries of the parole program had 30 days to leave the U.S. or face arrest and deportation.",
      "A group of 23 individuals and a nonprofit organization challenged the termination of the CHNV parole program and prevailed before the U.S. district court in stopping the administration from terminating their legal protections.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a bill to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the \"Gulf of America,\" which would codify an executive order signed by President Trump on his first day in office.",
      "In a 211 to 206 vote, all but one Republican supporting the measure, which was introduced by GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia in January and instructs federal agencies to update all documents and maps to reflect the name change within six months of enactment. It now goes to the Senate.",
      "Even if the name change is codified into U.S. law, however, other countries would be under no obligation to refer to the Gulf of Mexico by the new name. If it isn't codified, a future president could reverse Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "Greene lauded the measure ahead of the vote Thursday morning, calling it \"one of the most important things that we can do this Congress,\" while claiming that Democrats are catering to Mexican cartels by opposing the name change.",
      "\"This is such an important thing to do for the American people,\" Greene said. \"The American people deserve pride in their country and they deserve pride in the waters that we own, that we protect with our military and our coastguard.\"",
      "Democrats have called the effort a waste of taxpayer dollars and said Congress should be spending its time on more serious issues. GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska was the sole Republican to oppose the measure.",
      "Bacon publicly disagreed with his Republican colleagues, telling CNN earlier this week that the effort to rename the body of water \"seems juvenile.\"",
      "\"We're the United States of America,\" he said. \"We're not Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany or Napoleon's France. I just \u2014 we're better than this. It just sounds like a sophomore thing to do.\"",
      "The vote came as House Republicans clash over slashing Medicaid and other social safety net programs to pay for Mr. Trump's tax, border security and energy agenda.",
      "\"Instead of debating that very important and destructive legislation, they are speaking up today about this deeply unserious bill to rename a body of water,\" Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, said ahead of the vote Thursday. \"A Congress that more and more appears to just be a joke, is now advancing a bill that literally started off as a joke.\"",
      "An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that it would cost less than $500,000 over five years to update federal documents and maps. But during a House Rules Committee meeting Monday to advance the measure, Democrats noted that schools, libraries and municipalities would bear the costs of updating textbooks, signs and other materials.",
      "\"If a school district can't afford to purchase an entirely new map, you know what? A sticker would do,\" said Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, on Monday. \"Just put that over the top and put 'Gulf of America.' I mean, there are a lot of simple ways to deal with this.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House has dug in on the name change, restricting Associated Press reporters' access to events over the news organization's decision to refer to the Gulf by its original name, while also acknowledging the \"Gulf of America\" name. The Associated Press sued over the restrictions and a federal judge ruled that the White House restore its access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to other reporters.",
      "Whether the Senate will take up the measure remains unclear. Unlike the House, the bill would require support from a number of Democrats to move forward in the upper chamber. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told CBS News ahead of the House vote that he hasn't \"thought that far ahead.\"",

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn.

      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",

      "The Eta Aquariids will peak from Monday night through Tuesday morning, according to NASA. Astronomy fans hoping to enjoy the meteors can check local forecasts for detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "Under optimal conditions, about 50 Eta Aquariid meteors can be seen per hour during the shower's peak. But light from the waxing moon will wash out the fainter meteors this year, according to Bill Cooke, who leads NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office. Viewers can expect 10-15 meteors per hour just before dawn on Tuesday morning.",
      "When and where to see the Eta Aquariids",
      "While the shower will peak from May 5 to May 6, the shower will be active until May 21.",
      "To catch the meteors at their peak, NASA advises going outside around 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday. The moon will set by around 3 a.m., leaving skies dark until dawn.",
      "The shower will be viewable in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres but the conditions will be better in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "Viewers should find an area away from lights, then lie on their backs with their feet facing east.",
      "NASA advises viewers should look away from the moon and give their eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the dark. Avoid looking at bright lights, such as a cellphone.",
      "Bring a sleeping bag, blanket or lawn chair to keep comfortable while waiting for the meteors.",

      "But meteor showers \u2014 when many meteors hit Earth's atmosphere over a short period of time \u2014 happen less frequently. When meteors pass through the atmosphere, they leave streaks of light behind them, giving them the appearance of a shooting star.",
      "Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but some survive the trip and are then considered meteorites.",
      "What makes the Eta Aquariids unique",
      "The Eta Aquariids are known for their speed. The Eta Aquariids travel about 40 miles per second.",

      "Meteors in the Eta Aquariids come from space debris that originated from Halley's comet. Halley sheds a layer of ice and dust into space each time it returns to the inner solar system. The shed space dust forms two meteor showers a year: the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October.",

    "summary": "Bill Gates revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil and criticized the Trump administration's aid cuts. Here are some standout moments.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates is giving up his wealth for the health and wellness of millions, announcing exclusively on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he's committing $200 billion from the Gates Foundation to be spent over the next 20 years.",
      "Gates first revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" last week, saying he will take an \"equity, value-driven approach\" to the distribution of funds. It will go toward several causes, with a focus on global health and education. His ultimate goal: save tens of millions of lives, especially those of women and children suffering from HIV, malaria and other deadly illnesses.",
      "Here are some highlights from his discussion about his $200 billion mission, as well as what he calls his \"last chapter\" in life \u2014 and more.",
      "\"It's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do\"",
      "Gates said he won't miss the money, but he does hope he'll live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped hard-hit communities.",
      "\"I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers \u2014 as much as I need,\" Gates joked.",
      "Some might be thinking, Why now? To Gates, it's simple: You can get more done by spending more money. That's why the Microsoft co-founder said he's \"doubling down.\"",
      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "\"I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities,\" said Gates, adding that the Gates Foundation can't replace U.S. assistance.",
      "In fiscal 2024, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, with $14.4 billion toward humanitarian assistance, the Pew Research Center reports, citing ForeignAssistance.gov.",
      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "The \"last chapter\" of Gates' career",
      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",

    "summary": "Experts say the closure of Mr. Deepfakes, a major AI pornography website, is a step forward in addressing nonconsensual deepfake imagery.",
    "story": [
      "One of the largest websites dedicated to deepfake pornography announced that it has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support, effectively halting the site's operations.",
      "Mr. Deepfakes, created in 2018, has been described by researchers as \"the most prominent and mainstream marketplace\" for deepfake porn of celebrities, as well as individuals with no public presence. On Sunday, the website's landing page featured a \"Shutdown Notice,\" saying it would not be relaunching.",
      "The site allowed users to upload and view deepfake porn videos created using artificial intelligence. Forums on the site allowed users to buy and sell custom nonconsensual deepfake content, as well as discuss practices for making deepfakes.\u00a0 The owner of the site remains unknown.",
      "The shutdown comes just days after Congress passed the \"Take It Down Act,\" which makes it a federal crime to post nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. The legislation, backed by first lady Melania Trump, requires social media platforms and other websites to remove images and videos within 48 hours after a victim's request.",
      "While it's not clear if the website's termination was related to the Take It Down Act, it's the latest step in a crackdown on nonconsensual sexual imagery.",
      "Henry Ajder, an expert on AI and deepfakes, told CBS News that \"this is a moment to celebrate,\" describing the website as the \"central node\" of deepfake abuse.",
      "Ajder said the issue of nonconsensual deepfake imagery will not go away but disbanding the largest archive of deepfake porn is \"a step in the right direction.\" He said it makes the content less accessible and scatters the community of users, likely pushing them toward less mainstream platforms such as Telegram.",
      "\"I'm sure those communities will find a home somewhere else but it won't be this home and I don't think it'll be as big and as prominent. And I think that's critical,\" Ajder said.",
      "Ajder said he wants to see more legislation introduced globally and an increase in public awareness to help tackle the issue of nonconsensual sexual deepfake imagery.",
      "\"We're starting to see people taking it more seriously and we're starting to see the kind of societal infrastructure needed to react better than we have, but we can never be complacent with how much resource and how much vigilance we need to give,\" Ajder said.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to soon receive the first group of White South African refugees it says deserve a safe haven in the U.S. because of alleged racial discrimination in post-Apartheid South Africa, government documents obtained by CBS News show.",
      "The initial arrival of the South African refugees could happen as early as next week, according to the documents, which describe the effort as a \"stated priority\" for the Trump administration. Officials have planned a Monday press event at Dulles International Airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents show, although sources familiar with the effort told CBS News the timing of the plan could change.",
      "In February, President Trump issued an executive order directing officials to use the U.S. refugee program to resettle Afrikaners, an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands.",
      "The president claimed that Afrikaners faced \"government-sponsored race-based discrimination,\" citing a law that U.S. conservatives, like South African-born Elon Musk, have said allow racially motivated seizures of land owned by White South Africans. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination.",
      "The hastily arranged initiative to welcome Afrikaners stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration's move to ban most other refugees from entering the U.S.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions after returning to the White House was suspending the American refugee admissions program, stranding thousands of approved refugees who had been identified as vulnerable individuals fleeing violence and persecution in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.",
      "Federal courts have ruled against Mr. Trump's plan to shutter the refugee program, which Congress created in 1980 to offer refuge to those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion or political views. A federal judge recently ordered officials to resettle the approximately 12,000 refugees who were ready to travel to the U.S. when the refugee program was paused in January.",
      "The processing of Afrikaner refugees has also been unusually fast. Before Mr. Trump's second term, the State Department said the refugee process, on average, took between 18 to 24 months to complete due to background checks, medical screenings and other interviews. The Afrikaners ready to travel in the U.S. have gone through that process in a matter of months or even weeks.",
      "While the State Department's long-standing program to assist refugees during their first months in the U.S. has been halted due to Mr. Trump's actions, his administration has instructed resettlement officials to use Department of Health and Human Services funds to aid the Afrikaners.",
      "The government documents show resettlement officials were told they can use funds administered by HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement to help Afrikaners secure housing, household items and basic necessities during their first 90 days in America, including \"groceries, weather-appropriate clothing, diapers, formula, hygiene products, and prepaid phones.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Office of Refugee Resettlement is using \"existing infrastructure and funding\" to offer \"immediate support\" to Afrikaners.",
      "\"Initial arrivals are expected in the near term, with additional individuals anticipated over the coming months,\" the department said. \"(The Office of Refugee Resettlement) is coordinating closely with federal, state, and local partners to ensure these refugees receive the services needed to safely and successfully integrate within our country.\"",
      "In a statement, the State Department said the American embassy in Pretoria, South Africa has been interviewing those who have applied for resettlement to the U.S. under Mr. Trump's directive to welcome Afrikaners and that it continues to receive inquiries.",
      "\"While we are unable to comment on individual cases, the Department of State is prioritizing consideration for U.S. refugee resettlement of Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination,\" the department added.",

      "Park rangers found the body of the male bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058, about 125 yards from Highway 26 near the Buffalo Fork River on Tuesday. The bear was one of four cubs that emerged in May 2020 with their mother, Grizzly No. 399, who was often called the world's most famous grizzly bear.",
      "Grizzly No. 399, who was beloved for decades by countless tourists, biologists and professional wildlife photographers, was hit and killed by a vehicle in October on a highway south of Jackson, Wyoming. Park officials used wildlife tags to confirm the relationship between the two bears.",
      "Grizzly No. 1058 had been seen occasionally in the park since he was weened in 2022, but no sightings of him had been reported this spring. After he was hit by the vehicle, he made his way to a patch of willows, where he died, the National Park Service said in a statement.",
      "Park officials said Tuesday he may have been dead for several days before his body was found.",
      "At 28 years old, No. 399 was the oldest known reproducing female grizzly in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Each spring, wildlife enthusiasts eagerly awaited her emergence from her den to see how many cubs she had birthed over the winter - then quickly shared the news online. The bear had 18 known cubs in eight litters over the years, including the litter of four in 2020. She stood around 7 feet \u00a0tall and weighed about 400 pounds.",
      "Named for the identity tag attached to her ear by researchers, the grizzly was often seen near roads in Grand Teton, drawing crowds and creating traffic jams.",
      "The driver who struck and killed No. 399 was not speeding, and the bear's death was ruled an accident. Park officials have not released any additional details about the crash that killed No. 1058.",
      "The National Park Service reminded visitors this week that wildlife -- including bears, elk and moose -- are \"often near park roadways, difficult to see, and can cross the road unexpectedly.\" Officials said drivers should not speed and be especially vigilant in national parks.",
      "\"Pay attention to your surroundings,\" officials said. \"Speeding is not the only cause of wildlife collisions; park wildlife are often hit because drivers are distracted.\"",
      "Authorities said 49 grizzly bears died because of vehicle collisions between 2009 and 2023.",
      "Grizzly bears generally live to be around 25, though some in the wild have lived for over 35 years, according to the Fish & Wildlife Service.",

      "\"We have a high reliance on that workforce out there,\" he said. \"Not only at the local level, at the state level, but at the federal level to make our wildfire season successful to deal with those large fires. People are the critical component in all of this.\"",
      "National Forest workers reduced by thousands",
      "Merkley said Trump's budget proposal cuts forest and watershed management programs that improve forest conditions, eliminates a collaborative forest landscape restoration program and slashes 2,000 National Forest positions, on top of the thousands who left through early retirement, buyouts and layoffs.",
      "Most of those workers may not have the title \"firefighter\" but they all hold Red Cards - which shows they have special training to provide essential frontline support to firefighting crews, Murray said.",
      "\"In fact, around three quarters of forest service workers are trained in wild land firefighting,\" she said. \"They provide crucial surge capacity when a crisis strikes.\"",
      "Trail maintenance crews ensure the paths are clear for firefighting personnel and equipment, Murray said. Biologists conduct testing to make decisions about prescribed burns and fuel reduction planning.",

    "summary": "Rumeysa Ozturk was taken into custody on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0A federal judge is holding a bail hearing Friday for Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate who was detained by immigration authorities after the Trump administration revoked her student visa.",
      "Ozturk is currently detained at an immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana, where she was transferred after she was taken into custody in Massachusetts in March. The bail hearing in her challenge to her confinement comes after a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with a district court's order to transfer Ozturk to immigration custody in Vermont.",
      "Ozturk is appearing remotely from Louisiana and is testifying before the court. During the proceedings, and while her doctor was testifying about Ozturk's asthma diagnosis, a lawyer appearing alongside her in Louisiana said Ozturk was suffering from an asthma attack, and she was briefly excused for 10 minutes.",
      "One of Ozturk's lawyers said that she faces \"significant health risks\" if she remains in detention and urged U.S. District Judge William Sessions, who is presiding over the case, to immediately grant her bail.",
      "Allowing her to remain in custody shows that \"you can be detained thousands of miles from your home for more than six weeks for writing a single news article,\" her attorney told the court.",
      "Ozturk alleges that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights. She is among the several hundred international students attending American universities who have had their student visas revoked after they were accused of criticizing Israel or participating in pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys said that an immigration judge denied bond for the Turkish national during a hearing last month after they asked an immigration judge to release her as her immigration case proceeds.",
      "Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to Ozturk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa.",
      "The immigration judge, Ozturk's attorneys said, denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\"",
      "Ozturk was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities outside her Somerville, Massachusetts, residence on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration. She was not informed about the revocation before she was detained, her lawyers said.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" according to court filings.",
      "Ozturk had co-authored an opinion piece that was published in the Tufts' student newspaper last year that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed did not mention Hamas.",
      "Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release, writing that the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "After Ozturk was taken into custody, she was transferred to New Hampshire and then Vermont, where she was kept overnight before putting her on a plane to Louisiana. The 30-year-old student has been detained at an immigration facility in Basile since late March.",
      "In a court filing by Ozturk, she said that she has suffered multiple serious asthma attacks in ICE detention and has received limited medical attention at the Louisiana detention center. She said that she is one of 24 people in a detention cell that has a sign stating the room has a capacity for 14.",
      "During Friday's bail hearing, Ozturk said she has suffered 12 asthma attacks since she was detained in late March, which have become \"longer and harder to stop.\" Four of them occurred since Ozturk disclosed her history to the court in a declaration last week, she said. There are \"constant triggers\" that can bring on an attack, including the room conditions at the facility in Louisiana, limited access to the outdoors and stress from her confinement, Ozturk said.",
      "\"It is affecting me in a very negative way, alongside other women living here, not accessing enough medical care and medication,\" she said.",
      "If she is released while her case is adjudicated, Tufts will provide Ozturk with housing, she said. Ozturk can continue working toward completion of her doctorate if she is let out of detainment, she told the court.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts in the hours after she was taken into custody kicked off a battle over where her habeas petition should be filed and whether federal district courts even have the authority to consider the challenge. While initially filed in court in Massachusetts, a judge there transferred her case to Vermont, given that Ozturk was in the state at the time her lawyers filed her habeas petition.",
      "The Justice Department, however, has argued that the case should proceed in Louisiana, as that is where Ozturk is confined. They have sought, unsuccessfully so far, to have her challenge to her detention tossed out.",
      "Sessions, who sits on the federal district court in Vermont, ruled last month that Ozturk had to be transferred from Louisiana to ICE custody in Vermont. Separate from her bail hearing, the judge will weigh the merits of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit to block it. But the three-judge panel rejected the request and said federal immigration authorities had to transfer Ozturk to Vermont, as Sessions ordered them to do.",
      "\"Permitting Ozturk's transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, address concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution of this matter \u2014 all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed expeditiously,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan said in their unanimous opinion. \"At stake, too, is Ozturk's ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.\"",

      "President Trump's tariffs are making it a lot more expensive to have kids, parents and baby gear makers say.",

      "At the same time, the White House is trying to encourage Americans to have more children. Mr. Trump is even considering a $5,000 \"baby bonus,\"\u00a0according to a\u00a0New York Times report, to boost the U.S.' declining birth rate.",
      "New parents and couples that are expecting could soon face tariff-related cost increases of up to $1,000 a year on baby essentials, according to Natalie Gordon, the CEO of Babylist, a baby registry service.",
      "Gordon noted that price increases are already in effect across a range of products, given manufacturers' reliance on China to produce strollers, cribs, car seats and other required goods. Currently, an import duty of up to 145% applies to U.S. imports from China, where the vast majority of strollers sold in the U.S. are made.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday signaled that the rate\u00a0could come down, writing in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that an \"80% Tariff on China seems right!\"",
      "Calling for a reprieve",
      "Gordon is among a group of advocates calling on the White House to exempt critical baby products from sky-high tariffs. In addition to levies on Chinese products, a baseline 10% tariff applies to all U.S. imports. Additional country-based duties \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are currently on hold for 90 days.",
      "\"Manufacturers are, on a day-to-day basis, dealing with the shock of tariffs on products and are very willing to invest in supply chains,\" Gordon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are looking at what it takes to onshore products, but it takes time and investment.\"",
      "Gordon added that she believes the tariffs amount to a \"baby tax on every parent across the country.\"",

      "That's why she said a reprieve is necessary. \"We know the administration wants to support families to feel like they can have babies, and this is the easiest and quickest way they can do that,\" she said.",
      "Inventory sitting on U.S. store shelves already costs more than it did last month. For example, UPPAbaby, which makes car seats and strollers overseas, said in a statement\u00a0posted\u00a0on its website in an April that tariffs are making price increases \"unavoidable.\" Price hikes on some products went into effect May 5.",
      "An UPPAbaby car seat, for example, already costs $150 more than it did last month, according to Elizabeth Mahon, who owns Three Littles, a children's store in Washington, D.C. One of her most popular items, the UPPAbaby Vista stroller, now costs $1,199, up $300 from $899, she told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent in May.",
      "\"There aren't very many products that are made exclusively in the United States, and even products that are made in the United States rely on global manufacturing for production, or for their materials that they're packing things in or shipping materials,\" Mahon said.",
      "Resale proves popular",
      "The rising cost of parenthood has some parents turning to resale platforms, boosting demand for discounted open-box goods or overstock inventory.",

      "\"Price hikes we thought would happen over the summer are already happening in real-time,\" she said, adding that the increase in costs doesn't jibe with the White House's call for families to have more children.",
      "\"If anything, people will get sticker shock and not want to have more kids at a time when many families are already experiencing inflationary pressures at checkout,\" she\u00a0said.",
      "Kidsy has seen a 70% spike in traffic over the past couple weeks, according to Tandon, as parents look for ways to save money.",

    "summary": "The White House is expected to send Congress a rescissions package in the coming days, looking to claw back congressionally approved funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House is expected to send Congress a rescissions package in the coming days, looking to claw back congressionally approved funding amid a broader effort to dramatically slash spending.",
      "As the administration faces legal challenges to its efforts to slash the U.S. Agency for International Development, public broadcasting\u00a0and other programs, the White House is looking to Congress to formalize the process and put it on a stronger legal footing.",
      "Here's what to know about rescission:",
      "What is the rescission process?",
      "The rescission process is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent, rendering the funds no longer available to departments, agencies and offices. Those funds can then be redirected elsewhere or sent to the Treasury general fund.",
      "Congress has the power of the purse under the U.S. Constitution, and each year, lawmakers approve funding to keep the federal government running. Those funds are then dispersed throughout government agencies and programs. The president can temporarily defer funds, or withhold them altogether \u2014 but only with Congress' approval.",
      "The distinction was made under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which established a mechanism for clawing back funding and was intended to stop presidents from unilaterally freezing previously appropriated funds. The law requires the president to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation in most cases.",
      "Only discretionary funds can be rescinded. Mandatory spending, like Social Security and Medicare, cannot be.",
      "How does the rescissions process work?",
      "To kickstart the rescission process, the White House's Office of Management and Budget submits a formal rescission request to relevant committees in Congress, and the panels have 25 days to act on the package. It would then go to the House and Senate floors for expedited votes.",
      "Overall, Congress has 45 days to act on the rescission request. And rescission bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation in the Senate. Instead, they only require a simple majority to pass.",
      "What leaders in Congress have said about a rescissions package",
      "Congressional Republicans are generally optimistic about the process \u2014 and eager to get started.",
      "\"I'm anxiously awaiting a rescissions package,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a recent Axios event.",
      "Johnson said it's his expectation that Congress will pass a rescissions package for fiscal year 2025. And asked about going back in 2026, Johnson said \"I'll go back as many times as the president will send us a rescissions package.\"",
      "\"We have to reduce spending. I mean, it should even be a partisan proposition \u2014 it's something every American has to support,\" Johnson said.",
      "Asked by reporters about the timing of the package, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso said on May 6 that he had not heard from the White House on when a rescission request would be transmitted, though he said the White House had previously outlined what could be in it.",
      "\"There's a lot of wasteful Washington spending, and people at home want to make sure we get rid of it,\" Barrasso said. \"A rescissions package is one way to deal with some of it.\"",
      "What's expected to be targeted within an initial rescission package",
      "The White House package is expected to ask Congress to cancel around $9 billion, seeking to make permanent some of the spending that Elon Musk and Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency have slashed in recent months.",
      "The recission package would likely be only a fraction of the cuts, with an expected focus on foreign aid money from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, along with funding for major public broadcasting systems, including NPR and PBS. But the final product remains to be seen, and could pose hurdles for passage in narrowly held Republican majorities in the House and Senate.",
      "Sen. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican, said on Fox News in May that Musk and DOGE did the \"hard part\" by identifying the \"wasteful spending.\"",
      "\"Now Congress has to do the easy part and claw that back and make those cuts permanent,\" Banks said.",
      "Banks called the initial rescission package \"really simple,\" while saying that he's \"getting frustrated\" because of a lack of urgency around the package.",
      "\"This is just the first $9 billion \u2014 if we can't cut $9 billion, how are we going to cut $150 billion?\" Banks said.",
      "When have rescissions been approved before?",
      "Rescission has frequently been used in Congress to reallocate unspent funds. But requests from the White House come less frequently.",
      "Since 1974, presidents have proposed nearly $92 billion in cuts through rescission packages, of which nearly $25 billion were accepted by Congress, according to the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Congress approved $1.2 billion in cuts proposed by President Gerald Ford, $2.1 billion by President Jimmy Carter, $15.6 billion by President Ronald Reagan, $2.3 billion by President George H. W. Bush and $3.6 billion by President Bill Clinton. Neither former Presidents George W. Bush nor former President Barack Obama utilized rescission packages.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, the Senate rejected a rescission package sent by the White House requesting nearly $15 billion in cuts.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, who was a steady member of the high court's liberal wing during his tenure despite being appointed by a Republican president, died Thursday. He was 85.",
      "The Supreme Court said Souter \"died peacefully\" at his home.",
      "\"Justice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. \"After retiring to his beloved New Hampshire in 2009, he continued to render significant service to our branch by sitting regularly on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for more than a decade. He will be greatly missed.\"",
      "Appointed in 1990 to replace Justice William Brennan, Souter was a little-known judge on the U.S. appellate court in Boston when he was selected by then-President George H.W. Bush for the nation's highest court. He served on the Supreme Court for nearly 20 years, often frustrating Republicans during his tenure as he consistently joined with the liberal members of the court.",
      "Souter stepped down from the Supreme Court in 2009, creating the first vacancy for then-President Barack Obama to fill. He was succeeded by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who made history as the first Hispanic member of the high court and whose appointment did not change the ideological makeup of the high court.",
      "Born in Melrose, Massachusetts, on Sept. 17, 1939, Souter was an only child. He graduated from Harvard University in 1961 and spent two years as a Rhodes scholar at Magdalen College at Oxford. Souter received his law degree from Harvard in 1966 and began his legal career at the private firm Orr & Reno in Concord, New Hampshire.",
      "Souter left private practice to become assistant attorney general of New Hampshire in 1968, followed by deputy attorney general in 1971 and attorney general of New Hampshire in 1976. He then served as an associate justice on the New Hampshire Superior Court and was appointed in 1983 to the state Supreme Court by then-Gov. John Sununu.",
      "Souter's career on the federal bench began in May 1990, when Bush tapped him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit. He was a judge on the 1st Circuit for only three months before Bush nominated Souter for the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed Souter as the 105th justice by a 90-9 vote, and he joined the high court on Oct. 8, 1990.",
      "Souter had been described as a \"stealth\" candidate, given that he had not authored many controversial opinions and did not have a lengthy paper trail. Sununu, who was Bush's chief of staff and recommended Souter for the Supreme Court, said he\u00a0would be a \"home run\"\u00a0for conservatives.",
      "But Sununu's prediction that Souter would be a conservative justice proved incorrect. Souter joined\u00a0Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer in allowing the narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions.",
      "He also co-authored the 1992 majority opinion with O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy that reaffirmed Roe v. Wade's central holding that the Constitution recognizes the right to abortion, but set out a new standard for determining when government restrictions are allowed.",
      "Less than 15 years after Souter's retirement, a more conservative Supreme Court would go on to\u00a0overturn the landmark Roe decision\u00a0and effectively\u00a0end the use of affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions.",
      "Souter  also was among the four justices who\u00a0dissented\u00a0from the 2000 decision in Bush v. Gore and said the Supreme Court should not have stopped Florida's recount in the presidential contest.",
      "\"There is no justification for denying the state the opportunity to try to count all disputed ballots now,\" Souter wrote in a dissenting opinion.",
      "Souter returned to New Hampshire after retiring from the Supreme Court but continued to hear and decide cases on the 1st Circuit. Notably, he\u00a0joined a 2019 decision\u00a0from the Boston-based appellate court upholding Massachusetts' ban on certain semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.",
      "In 2020, Souter was part of a\u00a0unanimous decision\u00a0finding that the Justice Department during President Trump's first term lacked authority to condition federal law enforcement grants on state and local governments' assistance with deporting migrants suspected of entering the country unlawfully.",

      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. \"Up to Scott B.\"",
      "The conciliatory tone of Mr. Trump's post comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland.",
      "In a separate\u00a0post\u00a0Mr. Trump said China should open up its markets to the U.S. \"WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR THEM!!!\" he\u00a0wrote\u00a0\"CLOSED MARKETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE!!!\"",
      "The two nations, which trade billions in goods each year, have been in a tense stand-off since last month when Mr. Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports. China retaliated with a 125% levy on American goods.",
      "The upcoming talks in Switzerland represent the first publicly announced meeting between the two nations since the trade war began. A spokesperson for the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S. suggested in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Wednesday that the U.S. was the one to reach out and initiate talks.",
      "\"After carefully assessing the U.S. messages, China decided to agree to hold discussions,\" the spokesperson said Wednesday in\u00a0remarks\u00a0posted online. \"The talks are being held at the request of the U.S. side.\"",
      "Last month, President Trump said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding trade, but a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson later\u00a0denied this, telling reporters that no negotiations had taken place.",
      "A deal would be a welcome sign for businesses that rely on Chinese imports to prop up their sales, and for American shoppers who have already started to see price hikes online.",

      "\"That said, media reports in the last 12-18 hours have suggested U.S. tariffs could be cut to 50%-60% as soon as Sun night/Mon morning following the Geneva negotiations, and if that doesn't happen (or if they are only reduced to 80%), there would likely be a significant negative reaction in markets Mon morning.\"",

    "summary": "A judge made it clear there wasn't enough evidence to prove the jet fuel spill directly caused plaintiffs' medical problems.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has awarded a total of more than $680,000 to 17 families who say they were sickened by a 2021 jet fuel leak into a Navy drinking water system in Hawaii. The bellwether cases set the legal tone for another 7,500 military family members, civilians and service members whose lawsuits are still awaiting resolution.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leslie Kobayashi handed down the ruling Wednesday, awarding from $5,000 to more than $104,000 to each plaintiff. In her order, Kobayashi wrote that it was clear that even though the contaminated water could have caused many of the kinds of medical problems the military families experienced, there wasn't enough evidence to prove a direct link.",
      "The amount awarded to each of plaintiff was significantly smaller than the roughly $225,000 to $1.25 million that one of their attorneys, Kristina Baehr, requested during the two-week trial in federal court in Honolulu.",
      "As bellwether plaintiffs, the 17 were chosen because they were seen as representative of the thousands of other people whose cases are still pending.",
      "Baehr called the damage awards disappointing but said the families \"prevailed against all odds against the U.S. Government.\"",
      "\"These families can be proud that they helped prove to the world what truly happened when the Navy poisoned the water supply near Pearl Harbor and sickened so many,\" Baehr said in a press release. \"The Court rejected the Government's argument that thousands of our clients were just psychosomatic and that there was not enough fuel to make anyone sick.\"",
      "Baehr said the legal team was reviewing options for resolving the thousands of remaining cases. Baehr previously told CBS News that her clients experienced symptoms including dizziness, brain fog, disorientation, rashes, nausea, vomiting and burning in the esophagus.",
      "The government admitted liability for the spill before the trial began, but its attorneys disputed whether the plaintiffs were exposed to enough jet fuel to cause the vomiting, rashes and other alleged negative health effects.",
      "The spill happened at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, a giant installation built in the early 1940s to supply the planes and ships crossing the Pacific Ocean. The installation includes a series of massive tanks \u2014 each roughly the height of a 25-story building, capable of holding 12.5 million gallons \u2014 hidden inside caverns that the military excavated from a mountain ridge above Pearl Harbor.",
      "Underneath it all is an aquifer, equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to the city of Honolulu.",
      "In May of 2021, a ruptured pipe allowed more than 20,000 gallons of fuel to spill into a fire suppression line. It remained unnoticed inside the sagging line for six months until a cart rammed the line, releasing the trapped fuel. Around Thanksgiving Day, much of that fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "A Navy investigation report released the following year found that military officials failed to immediately notify the state Department of Health, that the Navy missed four separate opportunities to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination, and that the Navy told residents that the drinking water was safe without doing any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.",
      "Within a week of the spill, military families started complaining about health problems \u2014 including peeling skin, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea and other issues.",
      "The plaintiffs said they were left with ongoing health problems, including seizures, asthma, eczema and vestibular dysfunction.",
      "Jamie Simic, one of the plaintiffs named in Baehr's larger case, said her \"daughter's teeth were crumbling out of her head\" and that she herself was \"throwing up while cooking dinner.\"",
      "Mai Hall told CBS News that she, her husband and their two kids were living in military-provided housing at the time of the leak. The family quickly began experiencing symptoms, she said. Even their pets became sick.",
      "\"The cats were vomiting. I was like, 'Oh my God, we're gonna die,'\" she told CBS News in 2023. \"...We knew something was wrong. It was kind of like post-apocalyptic.\"",
      "The spill sparked an outcry from lawmakers, environmental groups and residents, and the military eventually agreed to drain the tanks and close the facility. The tanks were drained last year, but Baehr told CBS News in 2023 that the military didn't do much to help individual families.",
      "\"They didn't actually clear your house. They didn't properly flush any of those houses,\" Baehr said.",

    "story": [
      "After less than 24 hours of seclusion in the Vatican, cardinals ended the 2025 papal conclave with the election of a new pontiff. The man chosen,\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost, will be known as Pope Leo XIV \u2014 the first pope ever from the United States.",
      "Here's what to know about him.",
      "Where is Pope Leo XIV from?",
      "Pope Leo XIV was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, Illinois, in 1955. He is the first U.S. pope in the church's history, and is also a citizen of Peru, where he worked for many years.",
      "CBS News Chicago reports he grew up in south suburban Dolton and has two brothers. A woman who knew him in childhood says the Prevost family was very active in their church.",
      "\"His family was very, very devout Catholics. I will say that. The mom and dad both were,\" Linda Jorsch told the station. \"They never missed church, and they were very active within our parish. His mom was like a member of the Altar & Rosary Society. They were lectors in their church \u2014 very active, very devout family.\"",
      "He graduated from\u00a0Villanova University in Pennsylvania with a degree in mathematics, then studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago, where he earned a Master's of Divinity.",
      "When he was 27, he was sent to Rome to study, and he was ordained as a priest in 1982. He went on to earn a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.",
      "\"My experience of Cardinal Prevost was that he's not a showboat.\" a seminary classmate, Father Mark R. Francis, CSV, provincial of the Viatorians in the United States, told CBS News Chicago. \"He's very calm, but extremely intelligent, and extremely compassionate.\"",
      "Pope Leo XIV has voted in U.S. elections \u2014 and weighed in on Trump administration",
      "The new pope is registered to vote in the Chicago suburbs, and voting records obtained by CBS News show he's voted in several general elections \u2014 along with both Democratic and Republican primaries.",
      "He voted in the 2024 general election, as well as in the 2012, 2008, 2004 and 2000 cycles, according to the records. He also cast ballots in the 2016 and 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and in the 2008 and 2010 Democratic primaries.",
      "The now-pope has shared posts about politics on his X account for years, in some cases reposting criticisms of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "At one point, he shared an article headlined, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\" The article criticized the Catholic vice president for claiming Christians can prioritize love for family, then neighbors, their community, fellow citizens and, lastly, the world.",
      "What is Pope Leo XIV's background in the church?",
      "After his ordination, Prevost went to work as a missionary Peru. He returned to the U.S. for a few years and then went back to Peru, where he ran an Augustinian seminary in Trujillo.",
      "In 2014, he was appointed apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru by Pope Francis, according to the Vatican. A year later, he became a bishop.",
      "Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2023.",
      "Before becoming pope, Prevost, who is 69, was the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversaw the selection of new bishops.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",
      "\"He kept a low profile on the most contentious, nerualgic, sensitive, controversial issues\" facing the church, said CBS News papal contributor Francis X. Rocca.",
      "Pope Leo XIV congratulated by presidents, Chicago mayor",
      "President Trump posted a message on social media congratulating the first U.S.-born pope.",
      "\"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very  meaningful moment!\" he wrote.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, tweeted: \"Habemus papam - May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama also shared his best wishes for \"a fellow Chicagoan.\"\u00a0 \"Michelle and I send our congratulations to a fellow Chicagoan, His Holiness Pope Leo XIV. This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith,\" Obama wrote.",

      "\"Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon,\" Johnson wrote.",
      "Why did Pope Leo XIV choose his name?",
      "The first act of a new pope after he's elected is to choose a new name. This is to signify that his becoming pontiff is akin to a second birth, the Vatican said.",
      "Cardinal Prevost\u00a0chose the papal name Leo, one of the more popular choices in history, which has been used by 13 previous popes. The most recent one, Pope Leo XIII, served from 1878 to 1903.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss explained. Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461 and included a famous meeting with Attila the Hun where Leo dissuaded him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "She noted that Leo I was also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer.\"",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, also saw it as an homage to Leo XIII and called it \"very significant.\"",
      "Leo XIII was a \"great 19th century pope,\" Barron told CBS News. \"When the revolutions in the 18th century happened, and the philosophical revolutions of the 19th century, the church initially said 'no' to much of that. Leo represents a very nuanced, intelligent engagement with modernity \u2014 not caving into it, not saying yes completely, but not saying no \u2014 using the resources of our own traditions to engage modernity creatively. That makes him a bridge figure.\"",
      "The name a new pope chooses often reflects attributes they hope to embody in their papacy.",
      "It will \"indicate a certain spirit and direction and vision of the new pope,\" said Dennis Doyle, a theologian and professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Dayton.",
      "Pope Francis, for example, was the first pope in history to take that name, a nod to St. Francis of Assisi. In Catholic tradition, St. Francis of Assisi had a mystical vision of Jesus, who told him to rebuild his church. He also renounced his wealth and founded the Franciscan order of friars in 1290.",

      "The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,\u00a0Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u00a0on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow.",
      "\"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the president said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\"",
      "While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",
      "What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.\u00a0 President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, but\u00a0China denied\u00a0any talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place.",
      "The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal.",
      "\"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\"",
      "\"That's a low number,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"Many, some will be much higher.\"",
      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",

    "summary": "NOAA announced  that it is decommissioning several databases, including its widely reported annual compilation of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.",
    "story": [
      "NOAA announced Thursday that it is decommissioning several databases, including its widely reported annual compilation of\u00a0billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.",
      "The announcement was made on NOAA's website under \"notice of change,\" which said it would no longer be updated due to \"evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.\" The move was first reported\u00a0by CNN.",
      "The database is a popular tool, both for the government as well as the insurance industry, and media organizations often use it for reporting on the economic costs of extreme weather.",
      "According to a current NOAA employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of losing their job, part of the reason the billion-dollar database is being decommissioned is because it is \"not core\" to NOAA's mission, since its focus is on economics and an analysis of various datasets. Additionally, the lead researcher of the database resigned last month by taking a separation incentive package.",
      "More than 2,200 NOAA employees have been let go under the Trump administration, and the White House budget proposal would cut NOAA's funding by 30%.",
      "Criticism had been mounting against the billion-dollar database over the years, driven by\u00a0Roger Pielke Jr.,\u00a0a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and faculty at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Pielke argued it needs better metadata, review and documentation. He published\u00a0a paper in the journal Nature\u00a0last year about the database, saying it failed to meet NOAA's \"criteria of procedure and substance\" based on the agency's \"information quality and scientific integrity policies.\"",
      "In a phone interview with CBS News, Pielke said, \"I'm a huge fan of NOAA and the National Weather Service, they play a huge public service role, and I'm not happy with the sledgehammer that is being taken to the agency.\"",
      "He said having climatologists in charge of the data was problematic and resulted in some quality-control issues that could be addressed by proper economists. He also said the current dataset isn't fixable at NOAA, but that it would be very important for another federal agency to take disaster losses seriously and track the data.",
      "Several members of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology sent a letter to then-NOAA Administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad last fall sharing concerns that the database was misleading.",
      "\"The lack of updated, comprehensive data in these models raises considerable concern given that these reports have been cited by both Congress and the President as the justification for different federal government actions concerning climate change,\" they wrote, repeatedly citing Pielke's research in the letter.",
      "Spinrad says he doesn't necessarily disagree with Pielke's arguments, but believes it should be a collaboration between an office like the Bureau of Economic Analysis and NOAA.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is a large component of billion-dollar losses are based on environmental observations,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"How do you separate out the differences between a liquid natural gas facility exploding and a tornado hitting a town? ... What constitutes the physical delineations that cause a problem? You need an environmental component and I'd feel better with a NOAA scientist doing that in conjunction with an economist.\"",
      "According to Spinrad, critics have also taken issue with how much of the damage to attribute to\u00a0climate change as compared to other factors such as development and population growth in urban areas.",
      "Spinrad said he previously suggested that the report should be broken into two parts: the data and the interpretation of the causes.",
      "Both Pielke and Spinrad agree that good data needs to be collected and published.",
      "\"Yanking down the database obfuscates the discussion on natural disasters, and for this to go away and not be part of the dialogue is a big problem. If you talk to the reinsurance industry and retail, so many sectors rely on this database,\" Spinrad said.",

      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts, including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation.

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and opening statements are expected on Monday, May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "Pope Leo XIV gave his first homily at a Mass on Friday, one day after he was selected by a conclave of cardinals at the Vatican to lead the Catholic Church. The first U.S. pope in history said he would be a \"faithful administrator\" of the church and warned against reducing Jesus to \"a kind of charismatic leader or superman.\"",
      "He delivered his homily wearing relatively simple white and gold vestments, and spoke mainly in Italian.",
      "\"There are many settings in which the Christian faith is considered absurd, meant for the weak and unintelligent. Settings where other securities are preferred, like technology, money, success, power, or pleasure,\" Pope Leo said. \"These are contexts where it is not easy to preach the Gospel and bear witness to its truth, where believers are mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied. Yet, precisely for this reason, they are the places where our missionary outreach is desperately needed. A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.\"",
      "Leo also preached that, \"today, too, there are many settings in which Jesus, although appreciated as a man, is reduced to a kind of charismatic leader or superman. This is true not only among non-believers but also among many baptized Christians, who thus end up living, at this level, in a state of practical atheism.\"",
      "What else is Pope Leo going to do on his first full day as pontiff?",
      "Cardinals from the United States were expected to eat lunch with the new pope on Friday, and then they were all set to speak with the gathered international media in the afternoon.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to soon receive the first group of White South African refugees it says deserve a safe haven in the U.S. because of alleged racial discrimination in post-Apartheid South Africa, government documents obtained by CBS News show.",
      "The initial arrival of the South African refugees could happen as early as next week, according to the documents, which describe the effort as a \"stated priority\" for the Trump administration. Officials have planned a Monday press event at Dulles International Airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents show, although sources familiar with the effort told CBS News the timing of the plan could change.",
      "In February, President Trump issued an executive order directing officials to use the U.S. refugee program to resettle Afrikaners, an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands.",
      "The president claimed that Afrikaners faced \"government-sponsored race-based discrimination,\" citing a law that U.S. conservatives, like South African-born Elon Musk, have said allow racially motivated seizures of land owned by White South Africans. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination.",
      "The hastily arranged initiative to welcome Afrikaners stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration's move to ban most other refugees from entering the U.S.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions after returning to the White House was suspending the American refugee admissions program, stranding thousands of approved refugees who had been identified as vulnerable individuals fleeing violence and persecution in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.",
      "Federal courts have ruled against Mr. Trump's plan to shutter the refugee program, which Congress created in 1980 to offer refuge to those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion or political views. A federal judge recently ordered officials to resettle the approximately 12,000 refugees who were ready to travel to the U.S. when the refugee program was paused in January.",
      "The processing of Afrikaner refugees has also been unusually fast. Before Mr. Trump's second term, the State Department said the refugee process, on average, took between 18 to 24 months to complete due to background checks, medical screenings and other interviews. The Afrikaners ready to travel in the U.S. have gone through that process in a matter of months or even weeks.",
      "While the State Department's long-standing program to assist refugees during their first months in the U.S. has been halted due to Mr. Trump's actions, his administration has instructed resettlement officials to use Department of Health and Human Services funds to aid the Afrikaners.",
      "The government documents show resettlement officials were told they can use funds administered by HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement to help Afrikaners secure housing, household items and basic necessities during their first 90 days in America, including \"groceries, weather-appropriate clothing, diapers, formula, hygiene products, and prepaid phones.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Office of Refugee Resettlement is using \"existing infrastructure and funding\" to offer \"immediate support\" to Afrikaners.",
      "\"Initial arrivals are expected in the near term, with additional individuals anticipated over the coming months,\" the department said. \"(The Office of Refugee Resettlement) is coordinating closely with federal, state, and local partners to ensure these refugees receive the services needed to safely and successfully integrate within our country.\"",
      "In a statement, the State Department said the American embassy in Pretoria, South Africa has been interviewing those who have applied for resettlement to the U.S. under Mr. Trump's directive to welcome Afrikaners and that it continues to receive inquiries.",
      "\"While we are unable to comment on individual cases, the Department of State is prioritizing consideration for U.S. refugee resettlement of Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination,\" the department added.",

    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, scientists warned that a \"city killer\" asteroid had a small chance of hitting Earth. While that prediction was thankfully\u00a0revised, the planet may have to worry about another object plummeting down from the heavens \u2014 a 1970s spacecraft called Kosmos 482.",
      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's reentry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to fall through the atmosphere at 05:54 UTC on Saturday, or 1:54 am ET, but that forecast has fluctuated.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",
      "Space junk has hit Earth recently",
      "Space debris has crashed back into Earth in recent months.",
      "In February, debris from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off in the United States entered the Earth's atmosphere over Poland. Two chunks from an unidentified object \u2014 both measuring about 5 feet by 3 feet \u2014 were later found on the ground. Police said it was possible the objects came from the SpaceX rocket.",

      "While Leo held the first Mass of his papacy in the Sistine Chapel on Friday morning, the day after his election, that service was for the cardinals of the Catholic Church and was not open to the public.",
      "During the papal inauguration, a Mass is celebrated before political and religious leaders from around the world. While world leaders are typically invited to attend the Mass for the Beginning of the Pontificate, most nations tend to send official delegations rather than heads of state.",
      "The Mass used to include the papal coronation ceremony, but that portion of the celebration has not been included in the Mass since Pope John Paul I was officially installed as pope in 1978. His predecessor, Pope Paul VI, was the last pope to be crowned or to use a papal tiara.",

    "story": [
      "Two men were convicted Friday of cutting down Britain's beloved Sycamore Gap tree in 2023 in an unexplained act of vandalism that caused widespread outrage.",
      "Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers were found guilty by a Newcastle Crown Court jury of two counts each of criminal damage for felling the tree and toppling it onto the ancient Hadrian's Wall.",
      "The tree was not Britain's biggest or oldest, but it was prized for its picturesque setting symmetrically planted between two hills along the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire. The tree was set in a dip in the Hadrian's Wall in an otherwise treeless landscape.",
      "The tree had been known to locals but received international attention in Kevin Costner's 1991 film \"Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.\" It drew tourists, lovers, landscape photographers and even those who spread the ashes of loved ones. It was voted \"English Tree of the Year\" in 2016.",
      "\"For over a century, Sycamore Gap has been an iconic natural landmark in the northeast of England, bringing immeasurable joy to those visiting the area,\" Gale Gilchrist, chief prosecutor for the region, said in a statement after the verdict. \"In just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction.\"",
      "Jurors deliberated about four hours on Thursday and reached a verdict after meeting for less than 30 minutes Friday morning. Neither defendant showed any visible reaction as the verdicts were read.",
      "Justice Christina Lambert ordered both men held in custody until sentencing on July 15 and said they could face \"a lengthy period in custody.\" The maximum sentence for criminal damage is 10 years in prison.",
      "The defendants, once close friends, both testified that they had nothing to do with cutting down the tree. Graham pointed the finger at Carruthers.",
      "Prosecutors showed grainy video from Graham's phone of the tree being cut down \u2014 a video sent shortly afterward to Carruthers' phone. Metadata showed it was taken at the tree's location in Northumberland National Park. Data showed Graham's Range Rover had traveled there.",
      "Prosecutor Richard Wright said he couldn't say who cut the tree and who held the phone, but the two men were the only people in the world who had the video on their devices.",
      "The following day, Carruthers and Graham exchanged text and voice messages that captured their excitement as the story went viral.",
      "Prosecutors offered no evidence of a motive for the crime other than calling it senseless vandalism. But Wright suggested to jurors in his closing argument that the men cut the tree down for \"a bit of a laugh\" but had failed to realize the anger they would spark in the \"arboreal equivalent of mindless thuggery.\"",
      "\"They woke up the morning after and soon realized \u2014 as the news media rolled in, as the outrage of the public became clear \u2014 it must have dawned on them that they couldn't see anyone else smiling,\" Wright said. \"Far from being the big men they thought they were, everyone else thought that they were rather pathetic.\"",
      "Northumbria Police said two never gave an explanation for their actions, and added there could \"never be a justifiable one,\" BBC News reported.",
      "Prosecutors originally said the tree was valued at more than 620,000 pounds (around $830,000) and damage to the wall was estimated at 1,100 pounds (nearly $1,500). But on Friday prosecutor Rebecca Brown said those figures are in dispute and are likely lower, but would still fall in the top category of harm for sentencing purposes.",
      "The tree's value is important given that is is among the factors the judge will consider when deciding the sentences, the BBC reported."

    "story": [
      "After less than 24 hours of seclusion in the Vatican, cardinals ended the 2025 papal conclave with the election of a new pontiff. The man chosen,\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost, will be known as Pope Leo XIV \u2014 the first pope ever from the United States.",
      "Here's what to know about him.",
      "Where is Pope Leo XIV from?",
      "Pope Leo XIV was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, Illinois, in 1955. He is the first U.S. pope in the church's history, and is also a citizen of Peru, where he worked for many years.",
      "CBS News Chicago reports he grew up in south suburban Dolton and has two brothers. A woman who knew him in childhood says the Prevost family was very active in their church.",
      "\"His family was very, very devout Catholics. I will say that. The mom and dad both were,\" Linda Jorsch told the station. \"They never missed church, and they were very active within our parish. His mom was like a member of the Altar & Rosary Society. They were lectors in their church \u2014 very active, very devout family.\"",
      "He graduated from\u00a0Villanova University in Pennsylvania with a degree in mathematics, then studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago, where he earned a Master's of Divinity.",
      "When he was 27, he was sent to Rome to study, and he was ordained as a priest in 1982. He went on to earn a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.",
      "\"My experience of Cardinal Prevost was that he's not a showboat.\" a seminary classmate, Father Mark R. Francis, CSV, provincial of the Viatorians in the United States, told CBS News Chicago. \"He's very calm, but extremely intelligent, and extremely compassionate.\"",
      "Pope Leo XIV has voted in U.S. elections \u2014 and weighed in on Trump administration",
      "The new pope is registered to vote in the Chicago suburbs, and voting records obtained by CBS News show he's voted in several general elections \u2014 along with both Democratic and Republican primaries.",
      "He voted in the 2024 general election, as well as in the 2012, 2008, 2004 and 2000 cycles, according to the records. He also cast ballots in the 2016 and 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and in the 2008 and 2010 Democratic primaries.",
      "The now-pope has shared posts about politics on his X account for years, in some cases reposting criticisms of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "At one point, he shared an article headlined, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\" The article criticized the Catholic vice president for claiming Christians can prioritize love for family, then neighbors, their community, fellow citizens and, lastly, the world.",
      "What is Pope Leo XIV's background in the church?",
      "After his ordination, Prevost went to work as a missionary Peru. He returned to the U.S. for a few years and then went back to Peru, where he ran an Augustinian seminary in Trujillo.",
      "In 2014, he was appointed apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru by Pope Francis, according to the Vatican. A year later, he became a bishop.",
      "Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2023.",
      "Before becoming pope, Prevost, who is 69, was the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversaw the selection of new bishops.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",
      "\"He kept a low profile on the most contentious, nerualgic, sensitive, controversial issues\" facing the church, said CBS News papal contributor Francis X. Rocca.",
      "Pope Leo XIV congratulated by presidents, Chicago mayor",
      "President Trump posted a message on social media congratulating the first U.S.-born pope.",
      "\"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very  meaningful moment!\" he wrote.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, tweeted: \"Habemus papam - May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama also shared his best wishes for \"a fellow Chicagoan.\"\u00a0 \"Michelle and I send our congratulations to a fellow Chicagoan, His Holiness Pope Leo XIV. This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith,\" Obama wrote.",

      "\"Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon,\" Johnson wrote.",
      "Why did Pope Leo XIV choose his name?",
      "The first act of a new pope after he's elected is to choose a new name. This is to signify that his becoming pontiff is akin to a second birth, the Vatican said.",
      "Cardinal Prevost\u00a0chose the papal name Leo, one of the more popular choices in history, which has been used by 13 previous popes. The most recent one, Pope Leo XIII, served from 1878 to 1903.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss explained. Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461 and included a famous meeting with Attila the Hun where Leo dissuaded him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "She noted that Leo I was also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer.\"",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, also saw it as an homage to Leo XIII and called it \"very significant.\"",
      "Leo XIII was a \"great 19th century pope,\" Barron told CBS News. \"When the revolutions in the 18th century happened, and the philosophical revolutions of the 19th century, the church initially said 'no' to much of that. Leo represents a very nuanced, intelligent engagement with modernity \u2014 not caving into it, not saying yes completely, but not saying no \u2014 using the resources of our own traditions to engage modernity creatively. That makes him a bridge figure.\"",
      "The name a new pope chooses often reflects attributes they hope to embody in their papacy.",
      "It will \"indicate a certain spirit and direction and vision of the new pope,\" said Dennis Doyle, a theologian and professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Dayton.",
      "Pope Francis, for example, was the first pope in history to take that name, a nod to St. Francis of Assisi. In Catholic tradition, St. Francis of Assisi had a mystical vision of Jesus, who told him to rebuild his church. He also renounced his wealth and founded the Franciscan order of friars in 1290.",

The nuclear armed South Asian neighbors have attacked each other this week with missiles and drones in a sudden flare-up of a decades-old feud that's being watched with concern by leaders around the world.",
      "The bitter rivals have fought three wars over Kashmir in the past, and once again they're warning each other against any moves that could escalate the tension \u2014 and vowing to respond in kind to any such moves with tough military action.",
      "After a week of intense clashes, air raid sirens blared in a couple Indian cities near the Pakistani border on Friday and authorities asked people to remain indoors. Officials said a woman was killed and four men injured in alleged Pakistani cross-border fire in the Kashmiri town of Uri, while all major airports and the capital city of Delhi were on high alert, with some schools shut and major landmarks evacuated.",
      "Pakistani officials have accused India of killing at least 36 people this week, including 26 it says died in a Tuesday night missile attack on multiple locations, which Islamabad labeled an \"act of war.\" India called the strikes a measured response to the April terrorist attack, claiming it had killed 100 terrorists at camps and other sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.",
      "The rivalry between the two countries goes back decades, and at the heart of the dispute lies the stunning mountainous region of Kashmir.",
      "The Kashmir conflict explained",
      "Kashmir is a Himalayan region dotted with snow-capped mountains, pristine lakes, and beautiful meadows. It was previously one of the many \"princely states\" of India, ruled by so-called maharajas, before India gained independence from British rule in August 1947.",
      "That independence, however, has never been a simple matter. As it ceded its colonial power, Britain partitioned India into two nations: Hindu-majority India, and Muslim-majority Pakistan.",
      "The migration of Hindus from the newly carved out Pakistan into India, and of Muslims from India into Pakistan, was marred by massacres and widespread sectarian violence. It is widely considered the deadliest partitioning of a nation in contemporary history.",
      "At the time of partition, Kashmir was a Muslim-majority princely state, and its Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh, chose to remain independent of the two newly defined nations. But in October 1947, when tribesmen from Pakistan invaded Kashmir, the Maharaja sought India's help.",
      "India agreed to come to his assistance, but only if Singh would let India claim dominion over Kashmir as a precondition. The Maharaja agreed.",
      "India sent its army to Kashmir, which drove out the Pakistani tribesmen and, for all intents and purposes, Kashmir became a semi-autonomous part of India.",
      "India and Pakistan's wars over Kashmir",
      "Pakistan refused to recognize Kashmir's accession to India, dismissing it as a fraud. The standoff led the two nations into their first war that same year, and it endured into 1948.",
      "India asked the United Nations to intervene. The U.N. recommended that, after the full demilitarization of the region by both armies, a vote be held by Kashmir's residents to determine its future.",
      "That was never achieved, and in 1949, India and Pakistan signed a ceasefire agreement that divided hotly-contested Kashmir into two parts.",
      "Both nations claim all of Kashmir as their own territory, but each controls only part of it. Another, northeastern portion of the region is administered by China, which has long been a point of friction between Delhi and Beijing.",
      "In 1965, the tension over the region between India and Pakistan again erupted into a full-scale war. Thousands of people were killed on both sides. About seven years later, an agreement was signed that formally established a Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir, which still serves as the de-facto border between the two rivals.",
      "In 1989, a heavily armed pro-independence insurgency took root in Indian-administered Kashmir, launching deadly attacks against Indian forces. India has long accused Pakistan of training, arming and backing those militants \u2014 a charge Pakistan flatly denies.",
      "The three-decade insurgency has left tens of thousands of people dead.",
      "Pakistan has consistently denied the allegations that it supports Kashmiri separatists.",
      "In 1999, the two countries again engaged in a brief war, fought along the LoC in northern Kashmir.",
      "They almost went to war again following the deadly terror attack on India's commercial capital Mumbai in 2008, which was carried out by a militant group based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir \u2014 with, Indian authorities alleged, the full support of Pakistani security forces.",
      "India removed Kashmir's autonomy in 2019",
      "As the insurgency continued, India maintained a heavy military presence in Kashmir, making it one of the most militarized zones in the world. Indian forces have killed hundreds of separatists every year in regular shootouts across and around the LoC, but they have not managed to stop the militants' attacks.",
      "In 2016, gunmen whom India said were based in Pakistan killed 19 Indian soldiers in an attack on the town of Uri. India responded by launching what it called\u00a0\"surgical strikes\"\u00a0across the LoC, targeting alleged militant bases. Pakistan denied any Indian strikes on its territory.",
      "In 2019,\u00a0another attack\u00a0blamed on alleged Pakistani gunmen, on an Indian military convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama area, killed more than 40 paramilitary forces.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, furious over the attack, ordered\u00a0airstrikes\u00a0against Pakistan, sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight in which one Indian fighter jet was downed.",
      "Later that year, India's federal government, under Modi,\u00a0revoked Kashmir's special status, lifting the partial autonomy it had enjoyed since 1947, which granted the region its own constitution and major decision-making powers.",
      "Modi's government faced criticism for the way it revoked Kashmir's autonomy. A day before his government tabled and passed the bill in parliament, Indian forces launched a major crackdown in Kashmir. Internet, television and phone lines were shut down, and civilians were ordered to remain indoors. Dozens of people, including local politicians, were placed under house arrest as India flew more paramilitary forces into the region to maintain a security and information lockdown. Some of those restrictions remained in place for more than two years.",
      "Pakistan objected to the move and vowed to \"exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps.\"",
      "Over the following years, as India continued to bolster its security presence in the region, militancy waned and tourism returned to Kashmir. Modi's government took credit for transforming the region from a hotspot for terrorism, into a hotspot for tourism.",
      "But last month's terrorist attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam changed everything. It has once again put the two nations on a war footing - and the world on edge over the risk of another major conflict breaking out in already-tumultuous times, and between two nations with a long history of animosity, and nuclear weapons.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 17:42:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have both said numerous trade agreements could come as soon as this week.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom.",
      "Speaking from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said a \"breakthrough\" deal with the U.K. would include \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports,\" specifically agricultural products. He added that the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers.",
      "The final details are being written and will be delivered in the coming weeks, the president said.",
      "\"We still have our 10% tariff on which will produce $6 billion of revenue for the United States,\" said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during the White House briefing, referring to a\u00a010% tax on imported goods from all U.S. trade partners, including Britain, imposed by Mr. Trump in April.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would boost trade between the two countries and create jobs.",
      "\"This is a really fantastic, historic day in which we can announce this deal between our two great countries,\" Starmer \u00a0said over the phone during the White House announcement. \"I think it's a real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "Britain says the deal will cut\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on U.K. cars from 27.5% to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, adding that the agreement sets a quota of 100,000 U.K. vehicles that can be imported to the U.S. at a 10% tariff.",
      "News of a potential deal inflated investor confidence Thursday, with markets making gains in early trading. Following the trade deal announcement, the S&P 500 soared 55 points, or 1%, to 5,686 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 408 points, or 1% and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.3%.",
      "More trade deals are also in the works, according to President Trump.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is traveling to Switzerland this weekend, where he will meet with a Chinese trade delegation. Mr. Trump imposed levies of as high as 145% on Chinese imports, leading the country to fire back with 125% tariffs on American goods.",
      "For businesses, consumers and investors, progress on the trade front can't come soon enough amid ongoing uncertainty on where the U.S. economy is headed. A 10% baseline tariff on most imported goods has been in effect since April 5, while so-called reciprocal tariffs against other countries \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are paused until July.",
      "Where do negotiations stand?",
      "The announcement Thursday of a deal with the U.K. marks what could be the first of other trade agreements, with Mr. Trump and his team in negotiation mode with foreign leaders from Canada,\u00a0Italy, India, Japan and other trading partners since announcing his\u00a0\"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u00a0on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump has not specified when agreements with other countries would be announced, but said that more deals are to follow.",
      "\"We have many meetings planned today and tomorrow,\" the president said Thursday during the announcement from the Oval Office. \"And every country wants to be making deals.\"",
      "While testifying on Capitol Hill earlier this week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed the timeline for trade deals: \"I'd be surprised if we don't have more than 80% or 90% of those wrapped up by the end of the end of the year. And that may be much sooner,\" he said, referring to countries with which the U.S. has trade deficits.",
      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions. That's because of the longterm implications these deals will have, the former South Korean trade minister told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Negotiations will likely drag past May into June, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, although some countries might be motivated to act quickly.",
      "\"Everyone facing negotiations has been told to submit letters with their 'best offers,'\" Bremmer said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch, \"and smaller countries that desperately want/need deals are complying.\"",
      "Who is the U.S. negotiating with?",
      "Bessent told the House committee Tuesday that the U.S. has 18 \"important trading relationships\" and is currently negotiating with 17 to reach deals. \"Many of our trading partners have approached us with very good offers and we are in the process of renegotiating those,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration in recent weeks has discussed trade and tariffs with Canada, Italy, India and Japan.",
      "It's unclear which deals will be announced first, but Clayton Allen, who covers politics and policy in Washington for Eurasia Group, said to look for deals with Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and India \u2014 countries that have been engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S. the longest.",
      "Eurasia predicts a deal with Japan could come in mid-June.",
      "China absent from negotiations for now",
      "What Bessent did make clear to Congress on Tuesday is that the U.S. has not yet entered into active trade talks with China.\u00a0 President Trump in April said that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid tariff tensions, but\u00a0China denied\u00a0any talks between Beijing and Washington had taken place.",
      "The Treasury secretary, however, is set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend while conducting trade talks in Switzerland, the Trump administration\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "A\u00a0post\u00a0from the Chinese Embassy on X confirmed the meeting. \"Based on full consideration of global expectations, China's interests, and the appeals of the U.S. business community and consumers, #China has decided to agree to engage with the #US side,\" the posts reads. \"As China's lead on China-U.S. economic and trade affairs, Vice Premier He Lifeng will hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during his visit to #Switzerland from May 9 to 12.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the embassy said in a statement Wednesday that the U.S. has reached out to China \"through various channels\" and that the talks are being held \"at the request of the U.S. side.\" The spokesperson added that China \"firmly\u2002oppose[s]\u2002the U.S. abuse of tariffs.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong reiterated this stance, saying the U.S. \"needs to show sincerity to talk and be prepared to rectify its wrongdoing and cancel unilateral tariffs,\" according to\u00a0Bloomberg.",
      "What could trade agreements look like?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. trade pact gave the world its first glimpse at what future deals might look like. But as Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, points out not all trade deals will necessarily be created equal.",
      "\"For the rest of the world, this could offer something of a blueprint, but countries being threatened with even higher reciprocal tariffs would presumably have to offer more that the U.K., which only ever faced the 10% minimum,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Mr. Trump also signaled on Thursday that other countries should not expect to get the same treatment as the U.K. Asked whether the baseline 10% tariff on imported British goods would be a template for future trade deals, he said the answer is \"no.\"",
      "\"That's a low number,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"Many, some will be much higher.\"",
      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",
      "In other words, the U.S. could come to an agreement with a trading partner only to renege later on by issuing additional tariffs.",
      "\"The framework deal is only as good as the nice piece of paper that you write it down on,\" said Eurasia's Allen. \"Trade deals are very, very complex animals, and you're going to get probably top line agreement on some key issues of concern with a promise to come back and negotiate other things,\" he said.",
      "Asked by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce about the format of the deals, Bessent on Tuesday said, \"I expect that we can see a substantial reduction in the tariffs that we are being charged, as well as nontariff barriers, currency manipulation and the subsidies of both labor and capital investment.\"",

      "The Pope who blessed Rome gave his blessing to the world, to the entire world, that morning of Easter Day. Allow me to follow up on that same blessing: God loves us, God loves you all, and evil will not prevail! We are all in God's hands. Therefore, without fear, united hand in hand with God and among ourselves, let us move forward. We are disciples of Christ. Christ precedes us. The world needs his light. Humanity needs him as the bridge to be reached by God and his love. Help us too, and then each other to build bridges, with dialogue, with encounter, uniting us all to be one people always in peace. Thank you Pope Francis!",
      "I also want to thank all my brother cardinals who have chosen me to be the Successor of Peter and to walk together with you, as a united Church always seeking peace, justice, always trying to work as men and women faithful to Jesus Christ, without fear, to proclaim the Gospel, to be missionaries.",

Chicago-born\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost\u00a0was elected and accepted his fate as the next Bishop of Rome, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. He chose Leo XIV as his papal name.",

So, I think there's some truth to that, that we're such a superpower and so dominant, they don't wanna give us, also, control over the church.\"",

      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "27-inch light-field display (Looking Glass)",
      "How it works",
      "The\u00a0Looking Glass 27 uses light-field display technology, which projects multiple perspectives of an object simultaneously. This allows for \"Super Multi View\" experiences, where everyone around the screen can see a slightly different angle, just like in the real world. It\u2019s a step beyond traditional 3D displays, offering richer depth cues and a more natural viewing experience.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The display can showcase single images, 3D videos or interactive applications, and it\u2019s flexible enough to handle everything from quick model previews to fully interactive group experiences.",

      "A breakthrough in group 3D experiences",
      "Shawn Frayne, Looking Glass\u2019 CEO and co-founder, describes this release as a \"breakthrough moment for 3D.\" The new 27-inch display is the company\u2019s most advanced yet, combining major hardware and software advances to cut costs and dramatically reduce the computing power needed to run complex 3D content.",
      "The display sits at just an inch thick but packs a punch with 5K resolution (5,120 x 2,880 pixels) at 60 Hz, delivering up to 16 inches of virtual depth and 8-bit color. The result? Real-time 3D visuals that look and feel like they\u2019re actually present in the room.",
      "But what really sets this display apart is its ability to create a shared 3D experience. Unlike traditional VR or AR setups that require each participant to wear a headset, the Looking Glass 27 can project up to 100 unique perspectives across a 53-degree viewing cone. This means a team can gather around a single screen and see the same digital object from different angles, just as they would with a real-world prototype or artifact.",

      "Looking Glass has made it easier than ever for developers and enterprises to build, test and deploy 3D applications. Content creation starts on a computer running Unity, but the finished product can be deployed on an iPad, which also powers the display and serves as its interface. This approach reduces system costs by about 35% compared to previous models and makes deployment far more flexible. The display also supports Blender, Unreal Engine, WebXR and Looking Glass\u2019 own Studio and Bridge tools, making it compatible with a wide range of 3D workflows.",
      "The display is designed for versatility. It can sit on a desk or be mounted on a wall, and it\u2019s available in both portrait and landscape configurations (though you\u2019ll need to pick one when ordering). The software ecosystem allows for quick creation of 3D apps using Unity templates, and content can be managed just like any other iOS application, streamlining updates and deployment.",

Imagine medical students exploring a virtual anatomy lesson together or design teams collaborating on a 3D prototype without the hassle of headsets. The display\u2019s ability to render depth, texture, translucency and lighting effects as they appear in real life makes it a powerful tool for any field that benefits from visualizing complex, spatial information.",

This includes cards with \"INDEF\" (indefinite) expiration dates, despite past confusion and software glitches.",

TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport.",
      "However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025. The Global Entry card is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler card that meets federal identification standards and is explicitly accepted by TSA as an alternative to a REAL ID.

      "This development raises important questions about safety, reliability and the future of the trucking industry.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What's happening?",
      "Aurora's autonomous trucks now operate on routes between Dallas and Houston, hauling commercial loads.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "This isn't just a test program; it's a full deployment of driverless technology. Additional trucks will start operating on public roads in New Mexico and Arizona by the end of 2025, traveling at speeds ranging from 25 to 75 mph.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL",
      "How safe are these trucks?",
      "The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.\u00a0Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Report outlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds.",
      "Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over 2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents.",
      "Safety case and validation",
      "Aurora's safety approach is evaluated through a \"safety case\" method, commonly used in aviation and nuclear industries. A third-party audit by T\u00dcV S\u00dcD validated Aurora's safety management system, confirming alignment with SAE International's level 4 and level 5 standards. This audit also praised Aurora's safety culture and oversight practices.",

      "THE FUTURE OF TRUCKING ROLLS FORWARD IN SHELL'S EXPERIMENTAL BIG RIG",
      "Industry pushback: OOIDA and Teamsters raise concerns",
      "The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), representing over 150,000 truckers, strongly questions Aurora's safety claims.",
      "\"Simulations and supervised testing aren't enough,\" OOIDA states.\u00a0\"Phantom braking and unpredictable road conditions make autonomous trucks a risky proposition. Until there's mandatory, transparent oversight, these safety claims are premature.\"",
      "OOIDA also criticizes the lack of robust federal regulation, pointing to voluntary data programs like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) AV TEST as inadequate.",
      "\"Exemptions from FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) safety rules weaken proven standards,\" OOIDA argues. The association wants mandatory crash and disengagement reporting and warns against removing trained drivers from the cab entirely.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a labor union representing more than 1.2 million workers in North America, shares similar safety concerns.",
      "\"The Aurora Driver can't operate in severe weather like ice, unplowed snow or torrential rain,\" said Matt McQuaid, communications project manager for the Teamsters. He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\u00a0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.",
      "This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What this means for the future",
      "There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",
      "\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.",
      "That said, a\u00a0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\u00a0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.",
      "Still, consistent federal regulation is lacking. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has called for nationwide standards: \"We can't fall behind China or other countries. After safety, we need to give a wide runway for innovation.\"",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reveals that a new AirPlay bug lets hackers take over Apple devices via Wi-Fi with no clicks needed.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration.",
      "Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up.",
      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Oligo\u00a0recently disclosed AirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device.",
      "From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance.",
      "A woman scrolling on her smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What is Apple doing about the AirBorne bugs?",
      "Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches.",
      "A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors.",
      "The researchers also discovered that Apple CarPlay is affected. While exploiting it would be harder and would require Bluetooth or USB pairing, more than 800 car and truck models are potentially vulnerable.",

      "Steps to update your iPhone\u2019s software (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO UPDATE ALL OF YOUR DEVICES AND KEEP THEM SAFE",
      "5 ways to protect yourself from AirPlay hackers",
      "1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:\u00a0Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network.",
      "2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:\u00a0AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers.",
      "3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:\u00a0One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like caf\u00e9s, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices.",
      "Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:\u00a0Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Limit device permissions and exposure:\u00a0Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 10:00:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that Tesla owners are facing threats as hackers weaponize leaked data. Are you next?",
    "story": [
      "A 35-year-old man is accused of arson after a Cybertruck was burned at a Tesla dealership in Mesa, Ariz., on April 28, 2025. (KSAZ-TV)",
      "The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone.",
      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",
      "As the DOJ and FBI label these attacks as domestic terrorism and ramp up investigations, the chilling reality is that anyone, even those only suspected of owning a Tesla, can find themselves exposed and at risk.",

      "A Tesla supercharger (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How innocent people get caught in the crossfire",
      "On March 18, 2025, a hacker group launched \"Dogequest,\" a website featuring a searchable map of supposed Tesla owners and employees. The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk.",
      "The real-world consequences",
      "This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns. Law enforcement, including the DOJ, now calls it domestic terrorism. And because the data is so often wrong, anyone could be next, regardless of whether you've ever set foot in a Tesla.",
      "\"Doxxing\" affecting Tesla and non-Tesla owners alike (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why misidentification matters to everyone",
      "If you think you're safe because you don't own a Tesla, think again. The same flawed data sources that misidentified Tesla owners exist for countless other products, memberships and affiliations. Today, it's electric cars; tomorrow, it could be political donors, healthcare workers or anyone else whose data is bought and sold.",
      "HERTZ DATA BREACH EXPOSES CUSTOMER INFORMATION",
      "What you can do to protect yourself now",
      "Whether your personal data was exposed in a breach, leaked by someone with inside access or scraped from people-finder sites, you're at risk, not just if you own a Tesla, but even if you're misidentified. Here's how to reduce your exposure and protect yourself from becoming the next target of a doxxing attack.",
      "To help prevent your data from ending up in a breach or leak:",
      "Limit what data companies have on you in the first place. Fill in only the required fields, use email aliases and burner or VoIP numbers where possible, and use a P.O. Box in place of a street address. Provide fake details where it\u2019s practical and legal to do so.Delete accounts you no longer need. That online shopping account you used once five years ago? All that personal information is still sitting there, just waiting to be breached or leaked. Look for options like \"delete my data\" and \"delete data and close account\" rather than just \"close account.\"",

      "Also known as people-search sites, these data brokers profit by compiling detailed personal profiles that are fully searchable and available to anyone for a small fee. They're among the most dangerous sources of exposed personal information online. Fortunately, they're also some of the easiest to tackle, especially with the help of a\u00a0personal data removal service.",
      "These services send legally binding opt-out requests to people-search sites and other data brokers on your behalf, ensuring your information is taken down. Some services,\u00a0like our No. 1 pick, even offer custom removal options, where privacy professionals handle complex cases that go beyond automated systems.",
      "While no service can guarantee complete data erasure from the internet, using a trusted removal service is a smart way to automate and maintain ongoing protection from hundreds of data-hungry sites over time.",
      "CHECK OUT MY TOP PICKS FOR DATA REMOVAL SERVICES HERE",
      "Hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional critical digital defenses to implement",
      "While removing your data from brokers and minimizing online footprints are essential first steps, true safety in this new era of weaponized information also requires securing our digital infrastructure against both physical and virtual threats. Here are a few steps you can take to protect your data.",
      "Use two-factor authentication: Protect your vehicle\u2019s account and associated emails with\u00a0authenticator apps rather than SMS, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "Use a VPN: Mask your IP address when accessing your vehicle\u2019s apps on public Wi-Fi to prevent location tracking and man-in-the-middle attacks. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Cabin cam caution: Disable Cabin Camera Recording under Data Sharing unless essential. While Tesla claims footage isn\u2019t linked to identities by default, third-party app vulnerabilities could expose this data. Newer Teslas process cabin cam footage locally, but legacy models may still use cloud backups, so check your software version.",
      "Report doxxing or cyber harassment: If you\u2019ve been doxxed or targeted online, don\u2019t wait to take action. Report it to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3),\u00a0ic3.gov, or to local law enforcement, as many states have laws addressing doxxing, stalking and cyber harassment. File a police report with documented evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps). Also, for account-specific threats, contact Tesla customer service directly to report suspicious activity and secure your account.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The reality is unsettling but not hopeless, and while the threats of our hyper-connected world can feel overwhelming, you don\u2019t have to just hope you won\u2019t be targeted. You can take control by arming yourself with knowledge, using the right tools, building smart habits like checking your digital footprint, using removal tools and staying alert to new threats because the attackers are organized, and it\u2019s time we are, too.",

      "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically.",
      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",
      "That\u2019s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times.",
      "While they might seem harmless, these bottles contribute significantly to the growing plastic pollution crisis because they\u2019re often not recycled properly.",

      "Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",
      "How does it keep pills safe?",
      "You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AUTONOMOUS TRASH-GOBBLING ROBO BOAT WAGES WAR ON WATERWAY WASTE",
      "Real-world impact",
      "UVA Health is already leading the way by rolling out Tully Tubes across its system. This move is expected to eliminate millions of plastic bottles from their waste stream, showcasing how sustainable packaging can work even in industries with strict safety and regulatory standards. Their example proves that eco-friendly alternatives aren\u2019t just theoretical, they\u2019re ready for real-world use today.",

It challenges the longstanding reliance on plastic in the pharmaceutical industry by offering a practical, safe and sustainable alternative. As more hospitals and pharmacies consider adopting this new packaging, the impact could be enormous.",

      "Even firms entrusted with managing personal information are not immune. The latest example is VeriSource Services, a Texas-based employee benefits and HR administration provider that experienced a major data breach.",

      "What happened at VeriSource?",
      "VeriSource discovered\u00a0the breach Feb. 28, 2024, when it noticed unusual activity disrupting some of its systems. The company later determined an unknown attacker had gained unauthorized access around Feb. 27, 2024, stealing data on or about that date.",
      "Somehow, it took VeriSource over a year to determine the full scope of the breach, including the identification all individuals who had their information exposed.",
      "According to the investigation, this was a criminal cyberattack carried out by external threat actors (hackers), as opposed to an insider mishandling data. The perpetrators accessed sensitive personal records stored by VeriSource. In a\u00a0sample notice filed with state authorities, VeriSource reported that the compromised information included individuals' full names, mailing addresses, dates of birth, gender and Social Security numbers (via\u00a0BleepingComputer).",

Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as opening fraudulent accounts or filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams.",
      "What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised.",

Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you.\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "4. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn\u2019t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn\u2019t the only vulnerability worth addressing.",

      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Healthcare seems to be the favorite target of attackers this year. It's been only four months, and we've already seen some of the biggest data breaches in the sector. Recently, news about the Blue Shield of California data breach came to light, leaking the personal data of 4.7 million people.",
      "But if that wasn\u2019t enough, Connecticut\u2019s largest healthcare system, Yale New Haven Health, has now revealed that a data breach affected more than 5.5 million people.",

      "What you need to know",
      "According to a\u00a0legally mandated disclosure with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Yale New Haven Health experienced a cyberattack on March 8 that allowed malicious hackers to obtain copies of patients' personally identifiable information as well as some healthcare-related data.",
      "Yale New Haven Health is a nonprofit healthcare system based in New Haven, Connecticut. It includes five acute-care hospitals, a medical foundation, and a network of outpatient facilities and multispecialty centers across Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "In a\u00a0notice posted on its website, the healthcare system said the stolen data varied by individual but could include names, dates of birth, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, race and ethnicity information, Social Security numbers, types of patients and medical record numbers. Reportedly, the number of affected individuals may still change as investigations continue. Importantly, electronic medical record systems and treatment information were not accessed, and no financial account, payment or employee HR information was involved.",
      "This is not the first time healthcare systems have been in the crosshairs of cybercriminals. In recent years, attacks on institutions like\u00a0UnitedHealth and\u00a0Ascension Health have led to months of operational disruption, massive financial costs and prolonged investigations.",
      "Illustration of a doctor looking at data on a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVER",
      "What Yale New Haven Health is doing",
      "Yale New Haven Health brought in cybersecurity firm Mandiant to assist with the investigation and said a rapid response helped contain the incident and prevent any disruption to patient care. The organization noted that it regularly updates and strengthens its systems to protect sensitive data and will continue those efforts. Notification letters began going out to affected individuals on April 14, and complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services have been offered to those whose Social Security numbers were compromised.",
      "The breach could have serious consequences for those impacted. The stolen data includes highly sensitive information that can be used for identity theft, financial fraud, phishing attacks or targeted scams. Healthcare data is especially valuable on the black market because it can be exploited for long periods without easy detection. Even if Social Security numbers or medical information aren\u2019t misused right away, the long-term risk for affected individuals remains significant.",
      "We reached out to Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS), and a health system spokesperson said in part:",
      "\"We take our responsibility to safeguard patient information incredibly seriously, and we regret any concern this incident may have caused. We are continuously updating and enhancing our systems to protect the data we maintain and to help prevent events such as this from occurring in the future. For more information on this incident, patients may visit YNHHS\u2019 website at\u00a0ynhhs.org or call our dedicated, toll-free call center at 1-855-549-2678, Monday through Friday, between 9:00 am and 9:00 pm Eastern Time, excluding major U.S. holidays.\"",

      "If your information was part of the Yale New Haven Health breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Yale New Haven Health data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, social security number, and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The Yale New Haven Health data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Yale New Haven Health hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses..",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While Yale New Haven has been working with security experts to contain the breach and notify those affected, it is troubling that hackers were able to access the data of 5.5 million individuals before the organization detected the intrusion. The incident highlights a deeper issue, revealing gaps in the security infrastructure that many healthcare institutions are still not adequately addressing.",

Col. Matt Anderson,\" Brauchler said, describing the horrific scene that unfolded.",
      "\"In Colorado, the gut reaction charge would be, oh, that's vehicular homicide. And that sounds horrible, but in Colorado, we have some of the weakest traffic laws in the country. So vehicular [homicide] would have only been punishable at most by 12 years in the Department of Corrections.

Anything they come up with at this point, by way of excuse, has already been air-dried in front of the jury and rejected when they were convicted. There's no good message for America that comes out of these guys ever taking a free breath again.\"",

      "\"There has been a real concerted effort by decent people and many in the media to no longer amplify the killers; like, we should be focused on the victims. I would say since the Aurora theater shooter, I've said that guy's name maybe four times through the whole trial, which lasted from Jan. 20th until April 7th, 2015. I said his name exactly twice.

And I think that if you let these guys out, you do the opposite.\"",
      "Brauchler added that there are even studies now about the\u00a0correlation between the amount of notoriety that a criminal gets and then copycat-type crimes.",
      "\"I'll give you an example with Columbine. The STEM school mass shooting that I covered, both of those shooters had passing fascination with those Columbine shooters. We had a near-mass shooting at another high school right down the road from my kid's high school. They both had a fascination with the Columbine shooters and the Aurora theater shooter.

So, the more notorious an event or some people become, it does have an effect on other folks,\" Brauchler said.",

Just an incredible woman with an incredible story. She should inspire everyone.\"",
      "Clarke was born on April 29, 1945 at the gates of Mauthausen concentration camp, one of only three known babies to have survived birth there.",
      "Clarke\u2019s mother, Anka Kauderova, endured three and a half years in concentration camps: Theresienstadt in then-Czechoslovakia, Auschwitz, and the Freiberg slave labor camp and armament factory in Germany. She was eventually transported in open coal wagons, along with 2,000 other prisoners, on a grueling 17-day journey without food and with minimal water to Mauthausen.",

      "\"My parents were in Theresienstadt for three years, which was unusually long. They were young, strong, and able to work. To some extent, it was a transit camp to a death camp,\" Clarke told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"At the end of September 1944, their luck ran out. My father was sent to Auschwitz, and incredibly, my mother volunteered to follow him the next day. She didn\u2019t know where he was going and, ever the optimist, believed it couldn\u2019t get worse and they\u2019d survive,\" she said.",
      "Anka never saw her husband again. An eyewitness later told her that he was shot and killed in the death march near Auschwitz on Jan. 18, 1945. Auschwitz was liberated by the Russian army on Jan. 27.",
      "In 1943, Anka became pregnant. \"It was dangerous, but she met my father secretly. Becoming pregnant in a concentration camp was considered a crime punishable by death,\" Clarke said.",

      "Her brother was born in February 1944 but died of pneumonia two months later. \"Had my mother arrived at Auschwitz with a baby in her arms, both would have been sent to the gas chamber. Nobody knew she was pregnant again\u2014with me.\"",
      "In April 1945, Anka was sent to Mauthausen. \"It\u2019s a beautiful village on the Danube in Austria, but the camp sits on a steep hill behind it. When my mother saw the name at the train station, she was shocked\u2014she had heard how horrific it was. That shock likely triggered her labor, and she began giving birth to me,\" Clarke said.",
      "She credits her survival to timing. \"On April 28, the Nazis ran out of gas. I was born on April 29. Hitler committed suicide on April 30. On May 5, the American 11th Armored Division liberated the camp.\"",
      "When the Americans arrived, they brought food and medicine\u2014though many, weakened, died upon receiving them. Three weeks later, once Anka regained strength, U.S. forces repatriated her to Prague. There, Anka met her second husband, and the two left to avoid living under communism, eventually settling in the U.K.",

      "While Tehran has backed the Houthis since at least 2014 \u2013 and possibly as early as 2009 during the war in Yemen \u2013 through training and advanced weapons like ballistic missiles, Oman has also played a role by allowing the group to operate from its territory and serving as a key smuggling route for Iranian arms.",

    "summary": "Learn more about Pope Leo XIV after he was selected to become the first American-born pontiff. Robert Francis Prevost grew up in Chicago and attended Villanova.",
    "story": [
      "For centuries, the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church were largely Italians until a cardinal from Poland was elected pope in 1978 and then succeeded by a German and an Argentine.",
      "Now, for the first time, the pope's an American who has taken the name Leo XIV.",
      "And he's from the South Side of Chicago, home of the beleaguered White Sox, the Daley political dynasty and, until they decamped for Washington and eventually the White House, Michelle and Barack Obama.",
      "The new pope, who has spent much of his career ministering in Peru and leading the Vatican\u2019s powerful office of bishops,\u00a0was born Robert Francis Prevost on Sept. 14, 1955, at what was then called Mercy Hospital, at the corner of South Prairie Avenue and 34th Street.",
      "But while Prevost made his debut in Chicago, his parents and two older brothers were already living just south of the sprawling city in a working-class suburb called Dolton.",
      "Home was a tidy brick house the Prevosts bought new in 1949 on East 141st Place.",
      "Prevost's father, Louis Prevost, served in the Navy during World War II and worked as a superintendent of schools in the south suburbs of Chicago.",
      "The future pope's mother, Mildred Martinez Prevost, was a librarian with a master's degree in education and two sisters who were nuns.",
      "But the focus of the family was St. Mary of the Assumption Parish on 137th Street, which was then a busy church and school that straddled the Chicago/Dolton border.",
      "It was there that the Prevost family regularly attended Mass, which back then was still in Latin. And it was there that his classmates realized that Robert was already practicing what he would one day be preaching.",
      "\u201cWe used to pray with our hands, you know, our fingers pointing to heaven, and after a while you get tired of doing that, and you just want to fold them over,\u201d former classmate\u00a0Marianne Angarola, 69, told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cRobert Prevost never folded his hands over. He was just godly. Not in an in-your-face way. It was part of his aura, like he was hand-selected, and he embraced it. And he wasn\u2019t weird. He was nice.\u201d",
      "While most of the boys from St. Mary's went on to local Catholic high schools like Mendel College Prep, Prevost left home and attended St. Augustine Seminary High School, a boarding school in Holland, Michigan, that was run by priests from the Order of St. Augustine.",
      "Upon graduating, he headed east to Villanova University in Pennsylvania, a private Catholic college, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in math in 1977. By then, he had found his calling, and in 1978 he officially joined the Order of St. Augustine.",
      "Four years later, in June 1982, Prevost was ordained a priest after having studied theology at Catholic Theological Union of Chicago.\u00a0Then he was off to Rome, where he earned a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in 1987.",
      "He returned to Chicago, but only briefly, before he was dispatched in 1985 to Peru, where he served the order as a missionary and taught canon law in the diocesan seminary in the city of Trujillo for 10 years.",
      "By 1999, Prevost was back in Chicago and appointed leader of the Augustinian order's Midwestern region, which he oversaw until 2010.",
      "Part of his turf included Providence Catholic High School in New Lenox, and it was during his tenure that allegations surfaced that the school\u2019s president, the Rev. Richard McGrath, had abused at least one student and kept child pornography images on his phone.",
      "The Sun-Times reported last June that the Augustinians paid a $2\u202f million settlement to the abused student and that Prevost never explained why he did not remove McGrath from his post.",
      "By 2014, Prevost was back in Peru after Pope Francis appointed him apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo and later the bishop of Chiclayo.",
      "But in Peru, he was once again accused of failing to investigate and punish a priest accused of sexually abusing three sisters from 2007 to 2015.",
      "The Diocese of Chiclayo denied a cover-up, and Prevost has never been personally accused of abusing members of his flock.",
      "The allegations also did not derail his rise through the ranks.",
      "Francis promoted him to archbishop in January 2023 and made him a cardinal a year later.",
      "In public statements, Prevost often echoed Francis with calls for \u201creaching out to the poor, to the neediest, to those on the margins.\u201d",
      "But while Francis promoted greater acceptance of LGBTQ people, Prevost in a 2012 took a less tolerant tone in an address to a group of bishops, complaining that Western culture was fostering \"sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel,\" The New York Times reported.",
      "Meanwhile, Prevost's other job running the office that helps decide who will be appointed a bishop made him a contender for the top job at the Vatican, which he landed Thursday.",
      "Speaking in Spanish and Italian, but not in English, Pope Leo stood on the balcony overlooking his cheering flock and thanked the pope who blazed the path for him. He also laid out a vision of the future that Francis would most likely have applauded.",
      "\u201cWe can be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges, that is always open to receive everyone \u2014 just like in this square, to welcome everyone, in charity, dialogue and love,\u201d\u00a0he said."

      "His most recent activity on X came in mid-April, when he shared a post on his account from a Catholic commentator who called out Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for laughing about the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland. The post linked to an article published by the Catholic Standard newspaper, in which Bishop Evelio Menjivar asked of Catholics about Abrego Garcia: \u201cIs your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?\u201d",

      "Reached for comment Thursday, the White House directed NBC News to a post on X by Vance.",
      "Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019 and happened to meet with Pope Francis the day before he died, congratulated Prevost on being elected the first American pope.",
      "\"I\u2019m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!\u201d he wrote on X.",

      "\u201cWhat excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!\u201d",
      "Other reposts from Prevost's X account have suggested he supports protecting immigrants, reducing gun violence and combating climate change.",
      "The day after the Las Vegas mass shooting in October 2017, Prevost shared a post from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., that said: \"To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers. None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.\"",
      "Also in 2017, Prevost reposted someone who was defending immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, known as Dreamers.",
      "\"I stand with the #Dreamers and all people who are working toward an immigration system that is fair, just, and moral. #DefendDACA #DACA,\" the post said.",
      "In a matter of hours, his X account had added more than 200,000 followers.",
      "Still, the new pope has not been a prolific poster \u2014 and much of what he shared was fairly standard Catholic fare \u2014 so his social media posts don't give a complete picture of all his political views.",
      "Some conservative commentators have already seized on Prevost's posts and comments.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator and close Trump ally, published a series of posts decrying Leo\u2019s politics. \u201cJust another Marxist puppet in the Vatican,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was more neutral in his reaction to Prevost's election.",
      "\"Let\u2019s just say, not so great tweets about having some willingness for open borders. We\u2019ll see kind of how he is on that. Also some George Floyd stuff that I\u2019m not too crazy about,\" he said in a video on X. \"But overall, it seems like he\u2019s a pro-life warrior. There\u2019s a lot yet to learn about this pope, but I hope that he will be a strong advocate for strong borders. And for sovereignty.\u201d",
      "In 2020, Prevost reposted tweets offering prayers and a message of support for Floyd, whose murder by a Minneapolis police officer led to a national reckoning on race relations and policing.",
      "Other Republicans, like former President George W. Bush, had more positive reactions. Bush said in a statement that it's a \"historic and hopeful moment for Catholics in America and for the faithful around the world.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat and only the second Catholic to be elected to the White House, also voiced support for the new pope on X: \"Habemus papam \u2014 May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\""

      "Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 to replace liberal Justice William Brennan, Souter was viewed as a stealth candidate, someone who Republicans hoped could be easily confirmed but would prove to be a solid conservative.",
      "Souter, little known outside of New England, was duly confirmed by the Senate in a 90-9 vote.",
      "He quickly surprised both his supporters and opponents by forging a path as a moderate on the court who, as time passed, became a solid liberal vote on issues like abortion, the death penalty and LGBTQ rights.",
      "He was a low-key figure who steered clear of Washington cocktail parties and lived a frugal life, visiting his family home in New Hampshire as often as possible. He was known to enjoy a simple lunch of yogurt and a whole apple, including the core.",
      "In some ways, one of his biggest legacies was the impact he had on conservative legal activists, who vowed to ensure that a Republican president never appointed another justice who was not properly vetted in order to ensure the nominee would be a rock-solid conservative. \"No more Souters\" became a rallying cry on the right.",
      "Subsequent Republican nominees have all shifted the court, which now has a 6-3 conservative majority, further to the right.",
      "That Souter was to fall short of conservative expectations became crystal clear in 1992 when the Supreme Court considered a major challenge to abortion rights, then enshrined in law under the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.",
      "Conservatives had hoped that, with a conservative majority on the court, the case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, would lead to Roe v. Wade being overturned.",
      "But instead, Souter joined two other Republican appointees \u2014 Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 in crafting a decision that upheld what they called the \"essential holding\" of Roe while making significant changes to the legal test for upholding abortion restrictions.",
      "It would be another 30 years before the court, now with a more reliable conservative majority, would overturn Roe.",
      "Souter also dissented along with his liberal colleagues in 2000 when the court in the Bush v. Gore decision stopped the vote recount in Florida, thereby ensuring that Republican candidate George W. Bush became president.",
      "In 2009, at the relatively young age of 69, Souter gave up his lifetime appointment to return to New Hampshire. That he chose to leave the court under President Barack Obama, allowing a Democratic president to replace him, emphasized how much he was now perceived as a key part of the liberal bloc. Obama then appointed Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to serve on the court.",
      "Born in Massachusetts, Souter obtained both undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard and was also a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University.",
      "He worked as a lawyer in New Hampshire and eventually became the state's attorney general in 1976. Two years later, he became a state judge before being elevated to the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1983. Prior to his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, Souter served briefly as a federal appeals court judge."

      "The half-ton craft, known as Kosmos-482, was designed to land on Venus but instead has spent the past 53 years languishing in Earth\u2019s orbit because of a rocket malfunction. Now the spacecraft is expected to plunge through the atmosphere in the coming days, with the latest forecasts predicting uncontrolled re-entry will occur sometime on Saturday.",
      "A huge hunk of metal tumbling back to Earth may seem like a terrifying prospect, but old satellites, spent rocket parts or other small bits of space debris actually fall to Earth and re-enter the atmosphere on an almost daily basis, according to the European Space Agency (ESA).",
      "In most cases, the spacecraft will burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, with very few \u2014 if any \u2014 parts surviving the fiery journey. But even when some pieces have withstood atmospheric re-entry, it\u2019s very rare that they have fallen over land and caused any damage, mostly because oceans cover around 71% of the planet\u2019s surface.",
      "\u201cThe risk of any satellite reentry causing injury is extremely remote,\u201d ESA officials wrote in a blog post about Kosmos-482. \u201cThe annual risk of an individual human being injured by space debris is under 1 in 100 billion. In comparison, a person is about 65,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s difficult to make precise forecasts of when an uncontrolled spacecraft will fall back to Earth because much of it depends on atmospheric dynamics, space weather and the specific orientation of the object as its orbit degrades \u2014 all of which are tricky to model.",
      "As the spacecraft gets closer to re-entry, researchers will be able to refine these predictions, but it\u2019s still hard to know exactly where the spacecraft will make landfall.",
      "NASA said the landing location could be \u201canywhere between 52 N and 52 S latitude,\u201d a huge swath that covers Africa, Australia, much of North America and South America and large portions of Europe and Asia.",
      "Space Force officials said their latest predictions show Kosmos-482 re-entering the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, west of Guam, while ESA\u2019s ground track pegs the landing site south of Australia, in or around the Southern Ocean.",
      "Kosmos-482 was launched by the Soviet Union in 1972 on a mission to land on the surface of Venus. It was one of a series of missions to Venus, but this one became stranded in orbit around Earth after a rocket mishap.",
      "Most of the debris from the ill-fated mission already fell back to Earth decades ago, but it's the half-ton, spherical landing capsule that is expected to return to Earth sometime this weekend.",
      "Since the capsule, which measures about 3 feet across, was designed to operate on fiery-hot Venus, it could survive re-entry through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, according to Marco Langbroek, a scientist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, who has been tracking Kosmos-482 and posting updates online.",
      "\u201cIt is possible that it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and\u00a0impact intact,\u201d Langbroek wrote in a post that was updated Thursday. \u201cIt likely will be a hard impact: I doubt the parachute deployment system will still work after 53 years and with dead batteries.\u201d",
      "Still, that doesn't mean anyone on land will be in any immediate danger.",
      "\u201cThe risks involved are not particularly high, but not zero: with a mass of just under 500 kg and 1-meter size, risks are somewhat similar to that of a meteorite impact,\u201d he wrote."

    "summary": "Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a lifelong bachelor who was renowned for his love of a simple life in New Hampshire and dislike of Washington, died on Thursday at the age of 85, according to a Supreme Court statement.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, a lifelong bachelor who was renowned for his love of a simple life in New Hampshire and dislike of Washington, died at home on Thursday at the age of 85, the court said in a statement.",
      "Plucked from relative obscurity to serve on the Supreme Court, Souter gravely disappointed conservatives whose hopes that he would be a reliable conservative vote were quickly dashed as he aligned with more liberal justices on issues like abortion.",
      "\"Justice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. \"He will be greatly missed.\"",
      "Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 to replace liberal Justice William Brennan, Souter was viewed as a stealth candidate, someone who Republicans hoped could be easily confirmed but would prove to be a solid conservative.",
      "Souter, little known outside of New England, was duly confirmed by the Senate in a 90-9 vote.",
      "He quickly surprised both his supporters and opponents by forging a path as a moderate on the court who, as time passed, became a solid liberal vote on issues like abortion, the death penalty and LGBTQ rights.",
      "He was a low-key figure who steered clear of Washington cocktail parties and lived a frugal life, visiting his family home in New Hampshire as often as possible. He was known to enjoy a simple lunch of yogurt and a whole apple, including the core.",
      "In some ways, one of his biggest legacies was the impact he had on conservative legal activists, who vowed to ensure that a Republican president never appointed another justice who was not properly vetted in order to ensure the nominee would be a rock-solid conservative. \"No more Souters\" became a rallying cry on the right.",
      "Subsequent Republican nominees have all shifted the court, which now has a 6-3 conservative majority, further to the right.",
      "That Souter was to fall short of conservative expectations became crystal clear in 1992 when the Supreme Court considered a major challenge to abortion rights, then enshrined in law under the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.",
      "Conservatives had hoped that, with a conservative majority on the court, the case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, would lead to Roe v. Wade being overturned.",
      "But instead, Souter joined two other Republican appointees \u2014 Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 in crafting a decision that upheld what they called the \"essential holding\" of Roe while making significant changes to the legal test for upholding abortion restrictions.",
      "It would be another 30 years before the court, now with a more reliable conservative majority, would overturn Roe.",
      "Souter also dissented along with his liberal colleagues in 2000 when the court in the Bush v. Gore decision stopped the vote recount in Florida, thereby ensuring that Republican candidate George W. Bush became president.",
      "In 2009, at the relatively young age of 69, Souter gave up his lifetime appointment to return to New Hampshire. That he chose to leave the court under President Barack Obama, allowing a Democratic president to replace him, emphasized how much he was now perceived as a key part of the liberal bloc. Obama then appointed Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to serve on the court.",
      "Born in Massachusetts, Souter obtained both undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard and was also a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University.",
      "He worked as a lawyer in New Hampshire and eventually became the state's attorney general in 1976. Two years later, he became a state judge before being elevated to the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1983. Prior to his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, Souter served briefly as a federal appeals court judge."

    "story": [
      "A girl recovering from a rare brain tumor celebrated her 11th birthday Sunday, hundreds of miles away from everything she's known \u2014 her friends at school, her community at church, her home.",
      "She's one of four U.S. citizen children who were sent to Mexico from Texas three months ago when immigration authorities deported their undocumented parents.",
      "Fearing for their safety after the mixed-immigration-status family was taken to an area in Mexico that's been known for kidnapping U.S. citizens, they haven't given up on being able to return to the U.S. \u2014 primarily to continue the girl's medical treatment.",
      "On Friday morning, the family is traveling to Monterrey to meet with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. They hope  that sharing their immigration plight motivates legislators to advocate for their return under humanitarian parole, according to a family representative.",
      "\u201cPressure from the public about the deportation of vulnerable United States citizen children really is effective, and members of Congress are answering that call,\u201d Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil\u00a0Rights Project, the legal advocacy and litigation organization representing the family,\u00a0told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Democratic Reps. Adriano Espaillat of New York and Sylvia Garcia and Joaquin Castro of Texas are set to meet with the family, according to a spokesperson from the Texas Civil\u00a0Rights Project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important that the public continue paying attention to this but also continue engaging and encouraging members of Congress to take action,\u201d Garza said.",
      "The girl\u2019s mother\u00a0first told NBC News\u00a0about the family\u2019s ordeal in March. The case got the attention of several other congressional lawmakers, including Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Alex Padilla of California as well as Rep. Al Green, D-Texas.",
      "Since then, five other similar cases, including a mother who was deported to Honduras last month with her two U.S. citizen children, one of which is a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 cancer, have become public.",
      "\u201cIt would not surprise me if this were much more systemic than what we are currently seeing,\u201d Garza said.",
      "How it all started",
      "The mother previously told NBC News that on Feb. 3 the family was  driving from the Rio Grande Valley, Texas, area where they lived to Houston, where their daughter\u2019s specialist doctors are based, for an emergency medical checkup.",
      "On the way there,\u00a0they stopped at a stateside immigration checkpoint, one they have passed through multiple times. The parents were equipped with letters from their doctors and lawyers to show the officers at the checkpoint.",
      "But immigration authorities arrested the parents after they were unable to show legal immigration documentation. According to their attorney, Daniel Woodward, other than lacking \u201cvalid immigration status in the U.S.,\u201d the parents have \u201cno criminal history.\u201d He added the parents were in the process of obtaining\u00a0T visas, a temporary immigration benefit for victims of human trafficking.",
      "Five of their children, ages 15, 13, 11, 8 and 6 \u2014 four of whom are U.S. citizens \u2014 were with them when they were arrested. The parents and the children were taken to a detention facility, where they spent 24 hours before they were placed in a van and dropped on the Mexico side of a Texas bridge on Feb. 4.",
      "NBC News is not publishing the family members\u2019 names for safety reasons.",
      "Attorneys for the family filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in March requesting a probe into abuses they say the family faced in U.S. detention. In the filing, they also requested immigration authorities grant humanitarian parole to the undocumented parents, the girl and one of her siblings.",
      "But that DHS office, which protected the civil rights of both immigrants and U.S. citizens, was dismantled shortly after the attorneys filed the complaint \u2014 forcing them to refile it with the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services. They have not yet received a response.",
      "A DHS spokesperson previously told NBC News that reports of the family\u2019s situation are \u201cinaccurate\u201d and declined to speak on the specifics of the case, citing privacy reasons. They said in a statement that when \u201csomeone is given\u00a0expedited removal orders\u00a0and chooses to disregard them, they will face the consequences.\u201d",
      "In response to a similar but separate case involving the removal of U.S. citizen children in connection with their mother\u2019s deportation, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Thursday: \u201cThe narrative that DHS is deporting American children is false and irresponsible reporting,\u201d adding that immigration authorities ask mothers if they wish to be removed with their children or if they want the children to be placed in the safe custody of someone the parent designates.",
      "McLaughlin added that undocumented parents can \u201ctake control of their departure\u201d by using the CBP Home app, the Trump administration\u2019s self-deportation app.",
      "Speaking from Mexico in March, the mother of the 11-year-old said in a video message in Spanish provided to NBC News that she and her husband, when they were detained, \u201cfaced the worst decision, an impossible one, to be permanently separated from our children or to be deported together.\u201d",
      "When undocumented parents of U.S.-born children are picked up by immigration authorities, they face the risk of losing custody of their children. Without\u00a0power-of-attorney documents or guardianships outlining who will take care of the children left behind, the children can go into the U.S. foster care system, making it harder for parents to regain custody of their children in the future.",
      "Making the case for humanitarian parole",
      "Just after her birthday, the girl had her first medical checkup in Monterrey this week.",
      "Denisse Molina, a humanitarian outreach coordinator at the Texas Civil\u00a0Rights Project, said it took her \u201ctwo exhausting days, countless phone calls, and being bounced between hospital departments\u201d to secure a medical appointment and schedule an MRI for the girl.",
      "\u201cNo one\u2014especially a child in need \u2014 should have to fight this hard just to access essential care,\u201d Molina told NBC News in a statement Thursday.",
      "While this temporary solution is bringing the family some relief, regular medical checkups are critical, according to the child's mother and the family's advocates.",
      "The child was diagnosed with the brain tumor last year and underwent surgery to remove it, the mother said after learning of the diagnosis through translators. But Woodward said that since contacting the girl\u2019s doctors and obtaining her medical records in the family\u2019s pursuit to obtain humanitarian parole, she found out the cause of the tumor was an \u201cunnamed \u2018novel\u2019 condition.\u201d",
      "Few medical specialists can effectively monitor these kinds of cases; the girl's U.S. doctors are among those with the necessary expertise. The girl needs scans and checkups every three months, her doctors told the Texas Civil\u00a0Rights Project.",
      "The surgery that saved the girl\u2019s life last year left her with some lasting side effects. The swelling on her brain is still not fully gone, her mother said in March, causing difficulties with speech and mobility of the right side of her body.",
      "Before the family was removed from the U.S., the girl was routinely checking in with doctors monitoring her recovery, attending rehabilitation therapy sessions and taking medication to prevent convulsions.",
      "In Mexico, the family has been able to enroll four of their children in school while they get ready to apply for humanitarian parole later this month at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
      "According to the USCIS website, applicants may demonstrate urgency by establishing a reason to be in the U.S. that calls for immediate action, including critical medical treatment, or the need to visit, assist or support a relative who is ill.",
      "\u201cOur hope is that members of Congress will learn about this particular case and support our request for humanitarian parole for the family,\u201d Garza said."

      "President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to drastically cut the U.S.' current 145% tariff rate on China ahead of trade talks between the two countries.",
      "Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Friday morning: \"80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.,\" appearing to refer to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "The post comes a day before Bessent and U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer meet with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva for trade discussions.",
      "Trump indicated Thursday that he might be open to lowering the current 145% tariff on China. \u201c\u00a0I mean, we\u2019re going to see. Right now, you can\u2019t get any higher,\u201d he said during remarks from the Oval Office.",
      "A representative for the Chinese embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "An 80% across-the-board tariff would still be far beyond the duties the U.S. had in place on China before Trump took office. He first imposed a 20% levy on America's third-largest source of imports in response to its alleged inaction on curbing fentanyl flows, then signed an executive order several weeks later imposing 125% duties.",
      "In general, Trump's unwieldy approach to tariffs negotiations has continued unabated: On Thursday, he announced an agreement was being worked out with the U.K. that contained few details but which would leave the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board duty on all countries mostly intact. Yet while the agreement signaled pathways to expand U.S. exports of beef, ethanol and other agricultural products, it provided no guarantees, as yet, that the U.K. would actually increase imports of those products.",
      "Trump has attempted to walk back the eye-watering country-by-country duties he announced during his shock \"Liberation Day\" speech more than a month ago.",
      "But sizable levies remain, including 25% duties on all steel, aluminum and auto imports. While discussion of trade deals remains plentiful, actual progress on them has been relatively scarce \u2014\u00a0leaving business confidence throttled.",
      "A number of companies have already changed their forward guidance or reversed it entirely as a result of the uncertainty.",
      "It's also not clear that the China tariffs are having Trump's desired effect. In April, according to CNBC calculations, China\u2019s exports surged amid a ramp up in shipments to Southeast Asian countries \u2014 an indicator that China may simply be increasing trans-shipment of goods to third-party countries that then export to the U.S., an expert told CNBC."

      "India responded to the attack by launching military strikes on \u201cterror camps\u201d in Pakistan early Wednesday, which according to Pakistan killed 31 people, including civilians. Pakistan immediately claimed partial victory saying it had downed five Indian fighter jets and dozens of drones, which India has not confirmed.",
      "The April 22 attack was the worst of its kind on Indian civilians in two decades and capped years of separatist insurgency and the bitter resentment between the two neighbors over Kashmir, a former princely state and the only Muslim-majority part of India which ceded territory to India in 1947 when the British colonial rule ended.",
      "Pakistan and India have since fought three out of their multiple wars over it, and India has long-accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, which Islamabad denies. Both countries now lay claim to Kashmir in full but only partly control."

      "A judge is expected to rule Friday on the effort to remove Los Angeles County\u2019s top prosecutor from Erik and Lyle Menendez\u2019s bid to reduce their prison sentences after their defense team accused the district attorney of bias.",
      "Los Angeles County Superior County Judge Michael Jesic is also expected to rule whether a \u201crisk assessment\u201d can be admitted as evidence at their resentencing hearing.",
      "Prison and parole officials conducted the assessment, which examines the risk the brothers may pose to the public if they are released from prison, as part of a separate request for clemency that Erik, 54, and Lyle, 57, made to California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The brothers are serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez. They\u2019ve claimed the killings were in self-defense after Lyle Menendez confronted their father about sexually abusing his younger brother.",
      "Prosecutors have described the killings as cold-blooded and financially motivated.",
      "The brothers' first trial ended with a hung jury in 1994. They were convicted of first-degree murder after a second trial two years later.",
      "Their resentencing effort \u2014 which could make them eligible for parole immediately if it is granted \u2014 was supported by former Los Angeles County District George Gasc\u00f3n, who said they\u2019ve been exceptional prisoners during the more than three decades they\u2019ve spent behind bars.",
      "Many of the brothers' relatives \u2014 and some celebrities \u2014 have championed their cause and cited their accomplishments behind bars, including their assistance to inmates with disabilities, college courses they\u2019ve completed and a green space \u201cbeautification\u201d project they undertook at the Southern California prison where they\u2019re incarcerated.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s replacement, Nathan Hochman, has opposed the resentencing, saying there are 16 \u201cunacknowledged lies\u201d about the killings that the brothers haven\u2019t accounted for. Among them, he has said, was their account that they killed their parents in self-defense.",
      "Jesic will ultimately determine whether they should be resentenced.",
      "Hochman moved to withdraw his predecessor\u2019s request, but the effort failed, and the opposing sides were supposed to air their differences during a two-day hearing last month. Hours into the proceedings, Jesic postponed the resentencing bid and said he would instead consider the risk assessments \u2014 which haven\u2019t been made public \u2014 and the defense\u2019s argument that Hochman\u2019s office should be thrown off the case.",
      "In a filing, the defense pointed to a lawyer who previously represented a Menendez relative who opposed the brothers\u2019 resentencing and was later hired by Hochman to run his office\u2019s victim\u2019s services unit. The lawyer doesn\u2019t appear to have been properly walled from the case and hasn\u2019t treated other relatives fairly, according to the filing.",
      "\"No one from the District Attorney's victims services department has contacted even a single of the family members whose views conflicted with the views\" of that lawyer's former client, the filing says.",
      "The filling also cites \u201cgruesome\u201d crime scene photographs that were shown at a hearing last month without warning while Menendez family members were in the courtroom.",
      "Hochman apologized for the photos but called the effort to remove his office from the case a \u201cdrastic and desperate step\u201d that misses what he has described as one of the central issues in the brothers' resentencing \u2014 assessing whether they have taken full responsibility for their crimes."

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s no question that Jason Corbett was murdered in 2015, beaten to death with a brick and a baseball bat at his home in North Carolina. And there\u2019s no question that his wife, Molly Martens, and her dad, Thomas Martens, were charged with his brutal killing.",
      "One question, however, remained at the heart of the case as it unfolded: Was Corbett\u2019s killing a calculated murder, or an act of self-defense from a woman who had been abused?",
      "A new Netflix documentary, \u201cA Deadly American Marriage,\u201d takes a fresh look at the 2015 murder case that inspired widespread speculation and media coverage, both in the U.S. and in Corbett\u2019s home country of Ireland.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the real case behind \u201cA Deadly American Marriage,\u201d including the charges Martens and her father faced, and the very different narratives each family has shared about the circumstances of Corbett\u2019s death.",
      "What happened between Jason Corbett and Molly Martens?",
      "Jason Corbett, who was Irish, lived with his first wife, Margaret \u201cMags\u201d Fitzpatrick, in Ireland, and they had two children, Jack and Sarah.",
      "After Fitzpatrick\u00a0died unexpectedly of an asthma attack in the early 2000s, Corbett hired Molly Martens to work as an au pair. Romance bloomed between them and in 2011, they married and moved with Jack and Sarah to Davidson County, North Carolina.",
      "In 2015, a fateful altercation occurred between Corbett, Martens, and Martens\u2019 father, Tom Martens, a retired FBI agent.",
      "Tom Martens and his wife, Sharon, were staying with their daughter and husband at their home in Davidson County, visiting from Tennessee. One night in August 2015, Tom Martens said he heard a commotion coming from the couple\u2019s bedroom, including \u201ca scream and loud voices,\u201d according to his court testimony, included in a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.",
      "Tom Martens said he went to the couple\u2019s room with an aluminum baseball bat and discovered Corbett with his hands around Molly Martens\u2019 neck. Corbett then reportedly moved his wife into a chokehold using his right arm, according to Tom Martens\u2019 testimony per the Court of Appeals document.",
      "A fight ensued, and Tom Martens hit Corbett on the head with the bat, attempting to free his daughter. As the two men struggled for control of the bat, Molly Martens grabbed a paving brick from her nightstand and used it to hit her husband, according to Molly Martens\u2019s testimony included in the Court of Appeals document.",
      "Tom Martens regained control of the bat and continued to strike Corbett \u201cuntil he was down, and he felt certain that Jason \u2018could not kill them,\u2019\u201d according to his testimony.",
      "Tom Martens then called 911 and told the dispatcher that Corbett was \u201cin bad shape\u201d and \u201cbleeding all over\u201d and said, \u201cI may have killed him.\u201d",
      "Sergeant Barry Alphin, a paramedic, testified he found Corbett had experienced \u201csevere heavy trauma to the back of the head.\u201d",
      "An autopsy two days later determined Corbett\u2019s cause of death to be blunt force head trauma, including \u201cextensive skull fractures,\u201d according to the Court of Appeals document.",
      "Deputy David Dillard from the Davidson County Sheriff\u2019s Office wrote in a report that Molly Martens was \u201cvery obviously in shock\u201d from the incident, according to the court document.",
      "He also wrote that Molly\u00a0Martens\u00a0\u201cwas making crying noises but (he) didn\u2019t see any visible tears. She was also rubbing her neck \u2026 It wasn\u2019t a constant. She would do it and stop to do it and then stop while continuing to make the crying noises.\u201d",
      "Deputies also retrieved the children, who had been sleeping undisturbed throughout the incident, according to the court document.",
      "A few days later, Jack and Sarah were separately interviewed and evaluated at a children\u2019s advocacy center in Mocksville, North Carolina.",
      "Both children said their father often got angry at Molly\u00a0Martens\u00a0for small things, and Jack said he had personally witnessed times his father \u201cpunched, hit, and pushed\u201d Molly\u00a0Martens, according to the Court of Appeals document.",
      "The children\u2019s statements were not admitted as evidence in the subsequent trial, partly because \u201cthe court (was) not assured of the children\u2019s motivation to speak the truth,\u201d according to the appeals document.",
      "Questions arose over whether the children had been coached by Molly Martens to give certain answers, so that the children would be allowed to continue living with Martens in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe children appear to have known that if they were not in the custody of defendant Molly Corbett they would be taken to live in the Republic of Ireland with relatives of their father,\u201d the Court of Appeals document cites the trial court as stating.",
      "Both children later specifically recanted their initial statements, including in a recorded interview Jack conducted from Ireland with members of the District Attorney\u2019s Office in North Carolina.",
      "Following the incident, the children returned to Ireland to live with their aunt and uncle. Both Jack and Sarah Corbett continue to deny allegations that their father was ever abusive, and they now accuse their step-mother of manipulating them and lying about Corbett\u2019s killing, according to the documentary.",
      "Today, Jack and Sarah Corbett do not have a relationship with Molly Martens and they expressed their anger at her in the documentary.",
      "What crimes were Molly Martens and her dad charged with?",
      "In\u00a0December 2015, Molly Martens and her father, Tom Martens, were indicted by a grand jury for second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. They both pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.",
      "In August 2017, the defendants were found guilty\u00a0of second-degree murder, and both were sentenced to 20 to 25 years in prison under the custody of the North Carolina Division of Adult Correction.",
      "Molly and Tom Martens appealed the court\u2019s ruling, arguing that certain statements made by Corbett\u2019s children, Jack and Sarah, should have been included as evidence in the original trial, according to the 2020 appeals document.",
      "In 2021, both defendants were granted\u00a0a retrial. However, they both struck plea deals before the new trial began.",
      "Molly Martens pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter, meaning she accepted the charge but did not admit guilt. Her father, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.",
      "In a 2023 document, the Davidson County Superior Court Division outlined certain mitigating factors that led to the reduced voluntary manslaughter charge for Molly Martens.",
      "The document stated that the \u201cdefendant acted under strong provocation,\u201d and committed her offense under \u201cduress,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cthreat\u201d and \u201ccompulsion.\u201d",
      "These factors were not enough to justify a defense claim, but they \u201csignificantly reduced the defendant\u2019s culpability,\u201d the court found, according to the 2023 document.",
      "After Molly and Tom Martens pleaded to the reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter, they were sentenced to between 51 and 74 months, or between just over four to six years, in prison.",
      "They were given credit for the more than three-and-a-half years they had already served, meaning they would serve just an additional seven months behind bars.",
      "The father and daughter were both released from prison in June 2024.",
      "What have family members said about the case?Molly Martens\u2019 family and the Corbett family have shared very different narratives about the case, and about the nature of their relationship.",
      "Molly Martens has maintained that her late husband was emotionally and physically abusive, and that her acts on the night of Corbett's death were committed in self-defense.",
      "\u201cSometimes he would just be kind of seething and angry because I hadn\u2019t abided by something, or I\u2019d been somewhere I shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d she alleged in the documentary. \u201cAnd sometimes that would lead to a violent situation.\u201d",
      "She also accused Corbett of coercively controlling her by not allowing her to formally adopt Jack and Sarah. She alleged that by preventing her from adopting them, Corbett ensured she would never divorce him, because she knew she would lose access to the children if she left him.",
      "Molly Martens has also accused Corbett\u2019s family of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d the children and using them \u201cas tools of evil.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been weaponized against me, and they wanted to hurt me, and they did,\u201d she said in the documentary.",
      "Tom Martens has also stood by his actions on the night of Corbett\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if a father can see something worse than watching his child die in front of him. I was going to save her life or die trying,\u201d he said in the documentary. \u201cAnd I have no regrets.\u201d",
      "He said in the documentary that he believes his daughter was abused by Corbett.",
      "\u201cMolly was becoming a shell of what she had been. She was definitely not as happy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was definitely not as confident. She was acting beaten down. I did not realize the extent or seriousness of the domestic abuse, but I do now.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Corbett\u2019s relatives allege that Molly Martens did not kill Corbett in self-defense, and deny accusations that Corbett was abusive.",
      "Corbett\u2019s sister, Tracey Corbett-Lynch, who took care of Jack and Sarah following her brother\u2019s death, said in the documentary she wants \u201cthe world to know the truth about Jason.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very charismatic \u2026 family meant everything to him,\u201d she said in the documentary.",
      "In February, Corbett\u2019s daughter, Sarah Corbett Lynch, now 18, released a memoir about her late dad, \u201cA Time for Truth: My Father Jason and My Search for Justice and Healing.\u201d",
      "In a March interview with Ireland\u2019s Newstalk FM, she alleged that Molly Martens had coached her and her brother to tell authorities they had witnessed domestic abuse at home.",
      "\u201cWe loved Molly and we trusted her, and we were told that if we didn\u2019t lie that we would never see each other again and that we would be taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had been coached for years. Yes, the Martens sat us down before we went into those interviews and told us that we needed to say certain things.\u201d",
      "She has also shared her belief in the documentary that her dad was \u201cthe victim\u201d in the case, and expressed her anger over the Martens\u2019 reduced sentence and release from prison.",
      "\u201cThis is not what my dad deserves, it\u2019s not what I deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d",
      "Jack, now 20, also shared his belief in the documentary that his father\u2019s death was a calculated murder, not an act of self defense. He said that now, he has \u201cno feelings\u201d toward Molly Martens.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hate her, I just don\u2019t want to give her any power over me anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cMy dad was my hero,\u201d he also said. \u201cHe was someone I looked up to. He was my best friend.\u201d"

      "A new voice among Latin pop music, Taubert is cementing herself as one to watch with her heartbreak anthems, raw and sharp lyrics, catchy melodies and messages of empowerment and hope.",
      "Taubert has been catching the industry\u2019s and people\u2019s attention over the last year. The Colombian musician won the best new artist Latin Grammy Award in November, following her energetic performance of \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo Pas\u00f3?\u201d with Joe Jonas. She collaborated with the singer after she DM\u2019d him on Instagram \u2014 and he responded.",
      "\u201cWorking with Ela was one of those rare moments where the energy in the room just clicks. She has this beautiful vulnerability in her voice that immediately pulls you in,\u201d Jonas tells TODAY.com. \u201cFrom the first demo, I knew this song had heart \u2014 and collaborating with her just made it even more special. She brings so much truth to her music, and it was a privilege to be a part of that.\u201d",
      "The Jonas Brother adds that Taubert has a \u201cquiet power\u201d when it comes to her songwriting that \u201cfeels personal and poetic, but also universal. That balance is hard to find.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s creating her own space in Latin pop, and you can feel her heart in every lyric and melody. I love working with artists who have a real point of view, and she definitely does,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cSince I was a little girl, anytime I would see the time 11:11 or the numbers together, I would make a wish,\u201d Taubert tells TODAY.com in Spanish about the significance of the album's title. \u201cI was always a horrible overthinker, a person who would ask myself the same questions over and over again.\u201d",
      "One night at 11:11 p.m., she recalls, she hoped a certain someone would write her back. They did.",
      "\u201cThen I began to think, \u2018Why did you ask for that?\u2019\u201d she says, making her further spiral. This nightly ritual of asking questions and making wishes inspired her album. \u201cThis is like a midnight diary of all the questions I\u2019ve asked myself over the last 10 years.\u201d",
      "Born and raised in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, Taubert was always drawn to music, especially the pop sounds of Swift, Reik, Adele, Rihanna and Justin Bieber. Despite releasing her debut single, \u201cSalto de Fe\u201d (\u201cLeap of Faith\u201d in Spanish), in 2019, Taubert gained fans with her unique covers. In 2023, the singer caught the attention of Colombian reggaetonero Feid (and Billboard) when she put a melancholic twist on his song \u201cSi Te La Encuentras Por Ah\u00ed.\u201d From there, she began working with the Latin Grammy-winning Julio Reyes Copello and was part of the inaugural generation of aspiring singers in Universal Music Latino\u2019s Abbey Road Institute & Art House Academy.",

      "\u201cAll the song titles are questions, with Track 11 being the most special,\u201d Taubert teases. \u201cThe way they are listed is so people can feel a roller coaster of emotions, from falling in and out of love, making mistakes and growing up.\u201d",

      "For track No. 5, Taubert took a \u201cviaje al interior,\u201d meaning a soul-searching journey in which she experienced much-needed growth.",

      "\u201c\u2018\u00bfTe Imaginas?\u2019 is a song where I ask myself, \u2018Imagine if I hadn\u2019t been scared, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have done things in that way,\u2019\u201d she explains.",
      "'\u00bfQui\u00e9n Soy Yo Para Juzgar?'",
      "For Track Eight, Taubert asks, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d The spicy and in-your-face song, she says, is about her first boyfriend in school and what she\u2019s heard about him from her hometown friends.",
      "She jokes that when getting the tea on her ex, she thinks, \u201cWe listen and we don\u2019t judge.\u201d",
      "\"I was very young but it was my first heartbreak and it hit me hard,\" she says with a laugh. \"Looking back at it, I can laugh and say, 'You haven't changed at all!'\"",
      "Taubert notes that her favorite part of the song is the pre-chorus and chorus, which makes her chuckle thinking of the absurdity of her first love.",
      "When asked if the guy will know this song is about him, she replies with a sly smile, \u201cMaybe.\u201d",
      "'\u00bfQu\u00e9 M\u00e1s Quieres?'",
      "By the ninth song, the emotions explode. Taubert says that she wrote \u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 M\u00e1s Quieres?\u201d \u201ccon mucha rabia,\u201d or \u201cwith a lot of anger\u201d about another undisclosed former lover.",
      "The title translates to \u201cwhat more do you want.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a point in the album where you say the things as they are, as you feel them. It\u2019s not coming from a place of processing (your feelings), rather from anger and tears,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment you explode.\u201d",
      "She feels that many of her fans might not know that part of her, but hopes they can relate to the song and know it\u2019s OK to vent and let the frustration out.",
      "'Preguntas'",
      "Track 11, which translates to \u201cQuestions,\u201d is Taubert\u2019s \u201cmost personal\u201d song that touches on the special moments in her life. She describes the song as a sequel to her 2022 single \u201cCrecer\u201d and touches on the growing pains of life and everything she has gone through since moving to the U.S.",
      "Three years later, Taubert is making her dream come true as a singer-songwriter. Yet, as she sings in the track, she's lost half of her friends and has experienced the death of a loved one, her grandfather.",
      "\u201cI always thought I was very alone in how I felt about these types of situations, but my song \u2018Crecer\u2019 showed me that more people feel the way I do,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery lyric in this song describes every piece of who I am in the most blue and vulnerable way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe chorus says, \u2018You will be OK, I will be fine, so is life and you have to embrace it,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "She and her producer Kevin Aguirre wrote the song last year during a blue moon and decided to incorporate the sound of the ocean that was nearby."

      "Starting from a humble upbringing in London to being named one of America's Richest Self Made Women by Forbes in 2024, Grede said it wasn't until her late 20s that she was diagnosed with dyslexia.",
      "Mayo Clinic describes the condition as a learning disorder that makes reading difficult due to \u201cproblems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words.\u201d",
      "\u201cI got diagnosed because I had a boyfriend who was like, \u2018I think you\u2019re dyslexic. That\u2019s not a five, girl,\u2019\u201d she recalls, laughing. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, OK! Maybe I\u2019ll be assessed.\u2019\u201d",
      "Dyslexia is not related to intelligence, Mayo Clinic notes, adding that there's no cure to the condition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one who reads more books than me,\u201d Grede says. \u201cI feel like maybe there are ways that I learned to be more productive, or I found hacks.\u201d",
      "She explains her dyslexia has allowed her to \u201csee through problems,\u201d adding, \u201cI make things less simple somehow. And I feel like that must have come from being dyslexic \u2014 I had to simplify things.\u201d",
      "After growing up with a single mother, Grede first dropped out of high school and didn't finish fashion school. By age 26, she founded her first company and went on to co-found several brands with the Kardashian family: Good American with Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Skims with Kim Kardashian and Safely with Kris Kardashian. She's also a co-founder of clothing brand Off Season in collaboration with Kristin Juszczyk and the NFL.",
      "Grede made history on the business competition show \u201cShark Tank\" when she became the first Black female guest shark investor. Last month, Grede announced she now sits on the Obama Foundation's board of directors.",
      "Now, she\u2019s formulating her coveted advice into a podcast, \u201cAspire with Emma Grede,\u201d where she breaks down the \u201chabits, philosophy and strategies\u201d of the \u201cworld\u2019s most successful people.\u201d Per the Spotify description, the podcast also covers \u201ccareer advice, well-being, psychology\u201d and how to reach goals in business.",
      "And the new pursuit came together in just nine months, which Grede says isn't shockingly quick for her standards.",
      "\u201cI do everything quickly,\u201d she laughs.",
      "Grede described the podcast as \u201ca way of scaling mentorship\u201d by sharing the insights she\u2019s discovered over the years to a wider array of people in a more accessible way.",
      "\u201cWherever I go, (entrepreneurs) have questions for me. They\u2019re like, \u2018How do you do it? How do I get to the next level? How do I open my thing?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "As for someone with the spark of an idea, Grede says the first step is knowing who you are and what you bring to the table.",
      "\u201cI believe in having an expertise and having a real distinct point of view. You need those two things, really, before you even get out of the gate,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to have an unwavering self belief before you even start, because you can get pulled in so many directions.\u201d"

      "When \"Real Women Have Curves\" opened on Broadway at the James Earl Jones Theatre on April 27, audiences were met with a celebration of resilience, culture and unapologetic authenticity.",
      "Based on the play by Josefina L\u00f3pez, which was also adapted into a 2002 HBO film starring America Ferrera, \"Real Women Have Curves\" is set in a small sewing factory in East Los Angeles during the sweltering summer of 1987.",
      "At the center of the story is Ana Garc\u00eda, a bright, ambitious Mexican-American teenager caught between fulfilling her family's obligations and achieving her own dreams.",
      "She is the only American citizen in her family and works at the factory alongside her mother and other undocumented Latina women, hiding that she\u2019s been accepted to her dream college in New York on a full scholarship.",
      "The play, which L\u00f3pez drew from her own experiences growing up in L.A., doesn\u2019t shy away from the harsh realities faced by immigrant women \u2014 addressing fear of deportation and financial insecurity, while conversations about weight, looks and body image carry on in the background.",
      "In the musical adaptation, this same story is set to music and lyrics by Joy Huerta and Benjamin Velez, injecting vibrant sounds and rhythm into a narrative often presented in a much more somber tone.",
      "\u201cI love the music,\u201d Justina Machado tells TODAY.com. Machado earned a Tony Award nominee for originating the role of Carmen, the matriarch of the Garc\u00eda family in the musical.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so joyous and it\u2019s so important and it\u2019s so timely and it\u2019s so authentic and it\u2019s just something I\u2019m really proud to be a part of.\u201d",
      "This is a full circle moment for Machado, who also originated the role of Ana in the 1993 play, just as her own acting career was taking off.",
      "\u201cThat was the first big regional theater project that I had,\u201d Machado says.",
      "Years later, when director Sergio Trujillo first approached her with hopes she would tackle the blunt and strong-willed mother figure, Machado was hesitant.",
      "\u201cI could never see myself playing that role,\u201d Machado says. But after participating in a reading of the show, she says it just clicked. \u201cI just fell in love with the character. I fell in love with the women. I fell in love with the story. I fell in love with the music.\u201d",
      "That love radiates onstage, with Machado artfully portraying Carmen as a captivating and endearing figure, a bright and welcomed contrast to the harsher character we came to know in the film.",
      "She\u2019s charming, but Carmen still ascribes to stifling ideas of body image that her daughter fights against in the musical. Her constant commentary about her daughter\u2019s weight culminates in the musical\u2019s title song.",
      "Overcome by the summer heat inside the factory, which has only been intensified by an army of irons and garment steamers, the women strip down to their undergarments, confronting their insecurities and celebrating their bodies in the process.",
      "\u201cI have hesitation every night,\u201d Machado says of stripping down. \u201cBut I know how important that number is, and I know what it does for people.\u201d",
      "The relationships are the show\u2019s emotional heart. Mothers, daughters, coworkers and friends, all navigating personal and systemic obstacles together.",
      "\u201cThese women are working under horrible conditions,\u201d Machado says. \u201cThese women are scared that that La Migra is going to show up any second, and they\u2019re working in 100 degree weather, and they\u2019re still finding joy and love and compassion.\u201d",
      "Making her Broadway debut as Ana, Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba also shines in the coming-of-age tale.",
      "\u201cYou just have to listen to each other, react to each other, and if you like each other, that really helps, and we really like each other,\u201d Machado says about C\u00f3rdoba. \u201cShe\u2019s easy to love.\u201d",
      "The tension that anchors the emotional arc of the show, whether or not Ana will convince her parents to let her move to New York and go to Columbia University, resonates across cultural boundaries.",
      "\u201cPeople can be very strong in their opinions, and still have all the love for their child,\u201d Machado says. \u201cNo matter what ethnicity you are, what nationality you are, that is a universal story.\u201d",
      "\"Real Women Have Curves\" reclaims narratives long flattened or ignored, spotlighting the women who hold communities together under impossible circumstances. And it does so with music, a lot of laughter, and hope.",
      "\u201cThis story is just really, truly an immigrant story,\u201d Machado says."

      "Now, the Colombian superstar is opening up even further in the new Netflix documentary \"Ma\u00f1ana Fue Bonito,\" which translates to \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful,\" a reflection of the point of her career where she found herself at her highest professionally \u2014 despite being at one of her lowest personally.",
      "The film \u2014 which hits the streamer on May 8 \u2014 brings viewers inside the story of how the Grammy winner rose from a little girl in Medell\u00edn with dreams of singing to an international superstar.",
      "There are plenty of tears, but there is also a lot of laughter, celebration and triumph \u2014 especially after many on Karol's team advised her against a stadium tour, and she persisted anyway. She went on to become the first-ever Latina to headline a global stadium tour.",
      "Directed by Cristina Costantini (who also helmed \"Mucho, Mucho Amor\" about the life of famed astrologer Walter Mercado, and the upcoming \"Sally\" about astronaut Sally Ride), \u201cTomorrow Was Beautiful\" also touches on the singer's personal life. After a breakup from a very public relationship, her most recent album was beloved by fans for artfully capturing the realities of heartbreak. In the documentary, she opens up for the first time about the experience.",
      "\"Love can make you feel like the happiest person on Earth, but at the same time it can destroy you, your dreams, your whole world... everything you are,\" she says in the film.",
      "There's a lot of people feeling the same...and they don't have the words...but they can with my music, my testimony, my journey. And I love that.",

      "Ultimately, though, \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\" the album, tour, and now the documentary are all about Karol learning to love herself again. And after initially keeping the details private, she's also slowly opening up about learning to fall in love again, too: This time, into a \"healthy relationship\" with fellow Colombian superstar Feid. In the doc, she credits him as the person she's most been able to visualize herself with. On TODAY May 6, she told the third hour anchors: \"He understands what I do, I understand what he does. He is a really special soul. It is a blessing to have him.\"",
      "When asked if she was nervous about opening up about her love life for the first time in the Netflix doc, she admits in an interview with TODAY.com that it was a hard decision to make.",
      "\"I had a relationship that was like, super public, and everybody was into it ... so to have that hard moment of the breakup, in front of millions of eyes, was difficult,\" she says.",
      "\"But I think now it has become something that is part of my journey. I think I healed in front of my fans with my music. I understood that there\u2019s a lot of people feeling the same, and they are not able to speak about it, or they don\u2019t have the words, but they can with my music \u2014 with my testimony, with my journey. And I love that.\"",
      "Her love life, however, wasn't the hardest part for Karol to open up about. That, she says, was the portion where she reveals the real reason why she almost quit music more than a decade ago. As she previously told TODAY, in 2012, she decided she was done with singing and moved to New York to study business and English.",
      "But in the documentary, she explains that what truly led her to become \"disillusioned\" and take a break from music was a manager who came on to her when she was only 16 years old.",
      "\"It broke my heart, because it was like ... you are putting me in a situation in which you're using my hopes and dreams and putting this condition on achieving them,\" she says in the film, before adding that she couldn't bring herself to tell her parents what happened at the time.",
      "She tells TODAY.com now the scene in the documentary was so difficult for her to record, she has still yet to watch \"Tomorrow Was Beautiful\" with anyone but herself. But it was important for her to share her experience in the hopes that it will help other women.",
      "\"When I started being surrounded by different women in this industry, I started noticing that there was a cycle \u2014 that a lot of us have experienced something similar,\" she says. \"I wanted to share this moment so women can feel OK knowing that they can say no, and they can open that door and they can leave.

    "story": [
      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Leo XIV has inherited a raging battle for not only the soul of the Catholic Church, but also its place in the geopolitical world.",
      "The new pope will have to decide whether his global pulpit will continue Pope Francis\u2019 broadly progressive legacy, or revert to a more conservative approach. The first American pontiff will grapple with the spiritual decline in the church\u2019s European power base, coupled with its rise in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. And he will be forced to confront the legacy of the decadeslong sexual abuse scandal.",
      "\u201cUsually the most important thing that the pope has to take care of is the Catholic Church \u2014 but right now it\u2019s much more complicated because we are in a time of global disruption,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a professor and world-leading expert on the church\u2019s inner workings, based at Villanova University. \u201cThe church is much more global than ever before, so the cardinals will have to consider what it means to elect a global leader of the Catholic Church in this situation.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the ecclesiastical inbox:",
      "Sexual abuse scandal",
      "After hundreds of thousands of cases emerged in dozens of countries over the past century, the church\u2019s endemic sexual abuse scandal is far from resolved.",
      "Cases continue to be uncovered, and although Francis went further than his predecessors in addressing this, campaigners said he did nowhere near enough.",
      "\u201cThe next pope must institute a zero tolerance law for sexual abuse that immediately removes abusive clergy and leaders who have covered up abuse from ministry,\u201d Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, a Chicago-based watchdog, said before Leo was elected.",
      "\u201cHe must use his authority to enact fundamental, institutional changes to end the systematic practice of sexual abuse and its concealment,\u201d it said.",
      "Ideology",
      "Francis was widely seen as a progressive force, at least compared with predecessors and peers. He allowed priests to informally bless same-sex couples, asking, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d And over doctrinal dogma he favored topics such as global capitalism and the climate crisis.",
      "Though this was not cut-and-dried (he likened abortions to \u201chiring a hitman\u201d), his message enraged conservative traditionalists, including those on the American hard right, who would like to see Francis\u2019 successor revert to what they believe are the church\u2019s core teachings.",
      "\u201cIn a time when illiberalism is gaining ground internationally,\u201d Francis\u2019 \u201cmessaging was an unexpected oasis for many, and unwelcomingly out of step for others,\u201d said Effie Fokas, a research associate specializing in geopolitics and religion at the London School of Economics and Political Science before Thursday\u2019s election of Leo.",
      "\u201cSo there is great anticipation over whether the church will, on the one hand, choose to be an oasis or, rather, in step with the waves of right-wing conservatism sweeping over the United States and much of Europe and beyond.\u201d",
      "Geopolitics",
      "Whether Leo likes it or not, the new leader of 1.4 billion Catholics will become a leading voice in an upended world. Francis chose to use that platform to pontificate against the war in the Gaza Strip, for example, and even rebuked President Donald Trump\u2019s stance on immigration.",
      "The next pope can choose to continue these fulminations, or not. But even a less outspoken pope would be notable by his absence on the world stage.",
      "\u201cFrancis has been a beacon of hope in the world, probably the only ethical helm in the (sinking) ship of global politics,\u201d said Sara Silvestri, a senior lecturer in international politics at City St. George\u2019s, University of London, in an email.",
      "She hoped the new pope wouldn\u2019t \u201cfall in the trap of siding with\u201d any one political faction, but rather \u201cbypass this by emphasizing the universality of the Christian message, and its core values of justice and mercy that are non negotiable and cannot fit into the narrow box of a political party or political ideology.\u201d",
      "Geography",
      "A key element of how the new pontiff navigates these roiling waters will be his approach to the rapidly changing demographics of the church.",
      "Europe\u2019s Catholic population fell by nearly half a million in 2022, according to the Vatican\u2019s most recent figures, released late last year. Meanwhile, the Catholic population grew by 7.3 million in Africa, 5.9 million in North and South America, and about 900,000 in Asia.",
      "The number of priests tracks the European decline and rise elsewhere, the figures show.",
      "So a big issue for the new pope will be how to address the needs of a church whose followers are increasingly based in the Global South.",
      "\u201cWe need a pope who understands the issues facing the Third World,\u201d Piere Domerson, a priest from Haiti who is studying in Rome, told NBC News shortly before Leo\u2019s election was announced.",
      "\u201cWe always remember how Pope Francis understood this universality of the church,\u201d he said in St. Peter\u2019s Square. \u201cAnd because he appointed more cardinals from outside Europe, we have seen that become more universal, too.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9stor Medina, a professor of religious ethics and culture at the University of Toronto, said people in the Global South are \u201cbecoming more actively vocal about the church\u2019s involvement with colonization.\u201d",
      "That means if the new pope wants \u201cto keep people in the church, then social justice, ecology and critique of capitalism will still have to be front and center of the new papacy,\u201d he said.",
      "Managing these changing currents will not be straightforward \u2014 the developing world is not a monolith. While many progressive Catholic voices have come from Latin America, a number of African bishops, also for example, can be among the most conservative when it comes to same-sex couples, divorce and cohabiting outside of marriage."

    "story": [
      "For centuries, the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church were largely Italians until a cardinal from Poland was elected pope in 1978 and then succeeded by a German and an Argentine.",
      "Now, for the first time, the pope's an American who has taken the name Leo XIV.",
      "And he's from the South Side of Chicago, home of the beleaguered White Sox, the Daley political dynasty and, until they decamped for Washington and eventually the White House, Michelle and Barack Obama.",
      "The new pope, who has spent much of his career ministering in Peru and leading the Vatican\u2019s powerful office of bishops,\u00a0was born Robert Francis Prevost on Sept. 14, 1955, at what was then called Mercy Hospital, at the corner of South Prairie Avenue and 34th Street.",
      "But while Prevost made his debut in Chicago, his parents and two older brothers were already living just south of the sprawling city in a working-class suburb called Dolton.",
      "Home was a tidy brick house the Prevosts bought new in 1949 on East 141st Place.",
      "Prevost's father, Louis Prevost, served in the Navy during World War II and worked as a superintendent of schools in the south suburbs of Chicago.",
      "The future pope's mother, Mildred Martinez Prevost, was a librarian with a master's degree in education and two sisters who were nuns.",
      "But the focus of the family was St. Mary of the Assumption Parish on 137th Street, which was then a busy church and school that straddled the Chicago/Dolton border.",
      "It was there that the Prevost family regularly attended Mass, which back then was still in Latin. And it was there that his classmates realized that Robert was already practicing what he would one day be preaching.",
      "\u201cWe used to pray with our hands, you know, our fingers pointing to heaven, and after a while you get tired of doing that, and you just want to fold them over,\u201d former classmate\u00a0Marianne Angarola, 69, told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cRobert Prevost never folded his hands over. He was just godly. Not in an in-your-face way. It was part of his aura, like he was hand-selected, and he embraced it. And he wasn\u2019t weird. He was nice.\u201d",
      "While most of the boys from St. Mary's went on to local Catholic high schools like Mendel College Prep, Prevost left home and attended St. Augustine Seminary High School, a boarding school in Holland, Michigan, that was run by priests from the Order of St. Augustine.",
      "Upon graduating, he headed east to Villanova University in Pennsylvania, a private Catholic college, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in math in 1977. By then, he had found his calling, and in 1978 he officially joined the Order of St. Augustine.",
      "Four years later, in June 1982, Prevost was ordained a priest after having studied theology at Catholic Theological Union of Chicago.\u00a0Then he was off to Rome, where he earned a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in 1987.",
      "He returned to Chicago, but only briefly, before he was dispatched in 1985 to Peru, where he served the order as a missionary and taught canon law in the diocesan seminary in the city of Trujillo for 10 years.",
      "By 1999, Prevost was back in Chicago and appointed leader of the Augustinian order's Midwestern region, which he oversaw until 2010.",
      "Part of his turf included Providence Catholic High School in New Lenox, and it was during his tenure that allegations surfaced that the school\u2019s president, the Rev. Richard McGrath, had abused at least one student and kept child pornography images on his phone.",
      "The Sun-Times reported last June that the Augustinians paid a $2\u202f million settlement to the abused student and that Prevost never explained why he did not remove McGrath from his post.",
      "By 2014, Prevost was back in Peru after Pope Francis appointed him apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo and later the bishop of Chiclayo.",
      "But in Peru, he was once again accused of failing to investigate and punish a priest accused of sexually abusing three sisters from 2007 to 2015.",
      "The Diocese of Chiclayo denied a cover-up, and Prevost has never been personally accused of abusing members of his flock.",
      "The allegations also did not derail his rise through the ranks.",
      "Francis promoted him to archbishop in January 2023 and made him a cardinal a year later.",
      "In public statements, Prevost often echoed Francis with calls for \u201creaching out to the poor, to the neediest, to those on the margins.\u201d",
      "But while Francis promoted greater acceptance of LGBTQ people, Prevost in a 2012 took a less tolerant tone in an address to a group of bishops, complaining that Western culture was fostering \"sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel,\" The New York Times reported.",
      "Meanwhile, Prevost's other job running the office that helps decide who will be appointed a bishop made him a contender for the top job at the Vatican, which he landed Thursday.",
      "Speaking in Spanish and Italian, but not in English, Pope Leo stood on the balcony overlooking his cheering flock and thanked the pope who blazed the path for him. He also laid out a vision of the future that Francis would most likely have applauded.",
      "\u201cWe can be a missionary church, a church that builds bridges, that is always open to receive everyone \u2014 just like in this square, to welcome everyone, in charity, dialogue and love,\u201d\u00a0he said."

      "Speaking with Indian External Affairs Minister S.

He also \u201creaffirmed the United States\u2019 commitment to work with India in the fight against terrorism,\u201d the State Department said.",

      "Speaking with NBC News, an official Indian government source dismissed the idea of the U.S. or any other country playing a central mediating role, saying the issues were bilateral and that the message of any government to Pakistan should be to stop supporting terrorism.\u00a0The source said that India\u2019s strikes targeted terrorist infrastructure and followed 15 days of waiting for the Pakistani government to take its own action against militant groups.",

      "Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage into Gaza in the attacks, with more than 50 people, both dead and alive, believed to remain in Hamas' captivity, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The families of hostages who remain held in Gaza have warned that a ramped-up offensive will only put the lives of their loved ones at further risk.",
      "Meanwhile, right-wing ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition celebrated the plans for an expanded offensive, having advocated for such a move before and after the last ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which held for two months from Jan. 19 to March 18.",
      "Prior to that ceasefire, the Israeli military had taken control of around a third of Gaza.",
      "Even so, hopes remained in Gaza and Israel for a resumption of that truce ahead of a visit from President Donald Trump to the region planned for next week.",
      "While Trump has repeatedly touted a proposal for the U.S. to eventually take ownership of the Gaza Strip, Palestinians there implored him to take action to halt Israel\u2019s plans for an expanded offensive.",
      "Khan Younis resident Abu Muhsin, 55, asked \u201cWhere is Trump who calls for freedom and democracy?\u201d",
      "In Israel, meanwhile, Cabinet Minister Ze\u2019ev Elkin said Monday that a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d remained for talks to resume.",
      "From outside of his Cabinet, Netanyahu has faced growing criticism for resuming and expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The latest denunciation came from Eran Duvdevani, a prominent retired colonel who led a campaign by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers calling for an end to the war.",
      "Duvdevani told NBC News that a growing number of reservists were already rejecting calls to return to service in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.",
      "He added that without a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, Trump's intervention was likely the only thing that could stop an expanded offensive.",
      "\"This is the only way, to press Netanyahu,\" Duvdevani said in a phone interview early Tuesday. \"Nothing will happen if Trump will not press him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a hearing for\u00a0Netanyahu's testimony in his ongoing public corruption trial ended early Tuesday, according to Israeli newspaper\u00a0The Times of\u00a0Israel. It came as the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning for Yemen\u2019s Sanaa Airport ahead of what appeared to be a pending attack."

      "The Piprahwa gemstones, part of a dazzling cache of more than 1,800 artifacts that are now mostly housed at the Indian Museum in Kolkata, are named after the town in what is now the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh where they were buried in a stupa, or funerary monument, around 200 to 240 B.C.",

      "Secured in three glass cases and surrounded by a trove of other Buddhist artifacts, the display included shimmering penny-sized silver and gold-leaf stars embossed with symbols, along with pearls, beads and flowers cut from precious stones, including amethyst, topaz, garnet, coral and crystal.",
      "\u201cNothing of comparable importance in early Buddhism has ever appeared at auction,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said on its website, which was no longer promoting the sale Wednesday.",

      "The post comes a day before Bessent and U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer meet with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva for trade discussions.",

      "A representative for the Chinese embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "An 80% across-the-board tariff would still be far beyond the duties the U.S. had in place on China before Trump took office. He first imposed a 20% levy on America's third-largest source of imports in response to its alleged inaction on curbing fentanyl flows, then signed an executive order several weeks later imposing 125% duties.",
      "In general, Trump's unwieldy approach to tariffs negotiations has continued unabated: On Thursday, he announced an agreement was being worked out with the U.K. that contained few details but which would leave the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board duty on all countries mostly intact. Yet while the agreement signaled pathways to expand U.S. exports of beef, ethanol and other agricultural products, it provided no guarantees, as yet, that the U.K. would actually increase imports of those products.",
      "Trump has attempted to walk back the eye-watering country-by-country duties he announced during his shock \"Liberation Day\" speech more than a month ago.",

      "A number of companies have already changed their forward guidance or reversed it entirely as a result of the uncertainty.",
      "It's also not clear that the China tariffs are having Trump's desired effect. In April, according to CNBC calculations, China\u2019s exports surged amid a ramp up in shipments to Southeast Asian countries \u2014 an indicator that China may simply be increasing trans-shipment of goods to third-party countries that then export to the U.S., an expert told CNBC."
