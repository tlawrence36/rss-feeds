      "Clowns complete with red noses and tutus sung Carnival songs to sick children on the pediatric ward of a Rio de Janeiro hospital on Tuesday, bringing the ebullient festivities normally found on the streets straight to the young patients and their carers",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Clowns complete with red noses and tutus delivered the joy of Carnival to sick children in a Rio de Janeiro hospital on Tuesday, bringing the ebullient festivities normally found on the streets straight to the young patients and their caregivers.",
      "Street parties, known as blocos, are a fixture of Rio\u2019s Carnival celebrations. They\u2019re raucous, rambunctious romps with thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of partygoers.",
      "The vibrant chaos of Carnival street parties was, of course, unsuitable for sick children, so members of the Clown Circle project brought a gentler celebration to the State Servants Hospital in downtown Rio.",
      "Musicians, clowns and even a standard-bearer danced their way through the corridors decorated with streamers and masks, inviting children, parents, nurses and doctors into a merry dance and moment of celebration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really good feeling, because staying in a hospital with a child is tiring,\u201d said Moniky Fernanda de Nazare\u0301 Moreira, as she balanced her one-year-old son on her hip. \u201cWe need this to cheer the child up \u2013 and he loves a bit of a mess, so he had a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "While the trumpet, drum and banjo players played classic Carnival tunes, the clowns sought to create an individual interaction with each child, paying them a kind of attention that for once wasn\u2019t medical.",
      "\u201cIt really helps children improve,\u201d said Ioma Rodrigues Klemz, a doctor on the ward. \u201cYou see children who are sometimes very withdrawn in bed who start to communicate more, sing, dance,\u201d she added.",
      "The saying goes that laughter is the best medicine, and clown projects in hospitals even bring joy to hospitals in war-torn places such as Ukraine.",
      "The Clown Circle project in Rio offers weekly activities, creating themed performances around calendar events like Carnival.",
      "In Brazil, Carnival officially ended with Ash Wednesday last week, but such technicalities didn\u2019t stop the cheerful group. However, they adapt to the hospital environment, adjusting aspects like volume, explained Julia Schaeffer, a program coordinator.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about; bringing the street party into the hospital for those who can\u2019t be out,\" Schaeffer said. \u201cWe bring it here with an extra dose of care.\u201d",

      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d Brian Tyree Henry's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood",
      "If you ask Brian Tyree Henry about taking time off, he bursts out laughing.",
      "Since breaking out as rapper Paper Boi in the FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d he's become one of the busiest actors in Hollywood. He's worked consistently \u2014 with directors including Barry Jenkins, Steve McQueen and Chloe Zhao and big-name actors like Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Hemsworth and Melissa McCarthy. Henry's been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and an Oscar.",
      "His latest role is in the limited series \u201cDope Thief\" for Apple TV+ premiering Friday. Henry and Wagner Moura play Ray and Manny, two longtime friends in Philadelphia who pose as federal agents, conducting fake raids to steal drugs and money. It's a series of easy scores until they rob the wrong people and become targets themselves. Soon they're hiding out from the real DEA and a drug kingpin while trying to keep their family safe.",
      "\u201cThe minute that Wagner and I met each other, it was an instant electricity... We just felt like we knew each other all our lives,\" said Henry. \"That is exactly what you needed for Ray and Manny.\u201d",
      "The first episode was directed by Ridley Scott, and the series was created and written by Peter Craig, adapted from a novel by Dennis Tafoya.",
      "Craig describes Henry's versatility as an actor as \"like a jazz musician... It\u2019s fantastic for a writer, because you can throw him all kinds of added moments, and he\u2019ll incorporate and use them all.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity to star in \u201cDope Thief\u201d came about, Henry was ready for that long-awaited break \u2014 from TV. He wrapped \u201cAtlanta\u201d and had \u201cabout two days off\u201d before going into another FX show, \u201cClass of \u201809,\u201d where he played a character\u2019s past, present and future, and he was exhausted.",
      "\u201cTelevision is hard, you know? Like, I hear myself complaining about it; I know it\u2019s a first world problem, but you get very attached when you\u2019re doing a series. You're living with the character for quite a long time.\"",
      "So, there Henry was at 3 a.m. on a night shoot of \u201cClass of \u201809,\" wearing prosthetics as his character\u2019s future self, when his manager presented him with the script for \u201cDope Thief.\u201d \u201cWithin the first 10 pages I was incredibly attracted to Ray and also the bond he has with Manny.\u201d",
      "Time off otherwise really hasn't been his thing (hence the laughter), but Henry is quick to remind that he\u2019s had two long breaks from acting. One was during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, and the other was during the Hollywood strikes.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a person that\u2019s constantly on the move and the universe tells you to sit your (expletive) down, you kind of have to listen,\u201d said Henry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have stopped had the universe not said stop.\u201d",
      "Production was underway on \u201cDope Thief\u201d when the Hollywood guild strikes were called in 2023. Henry opted to stay in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere. I made sure to be there just in case,\" said Henry, who for the first time was an executive producer on the project. He wanted to be close in proximity to his local crew. They had a cookout with bouncy castles. \u201cI would explore, or we'd go tubing and I would drive to this little town called New Hope that has a wonderful ice cream shop called Moo Hope. It was truly amazing to be present and experience that part of life for myself.\u201d",
      "Henry doesn't just bond with the crew on his sets but actors too, often walking away with new friends who happen to be very famous, like, say, Julia Roberts \u2014 whom he's currently filming a movie with in London. \u201cShe's somebody I truly cherish,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never going to stop being weird to me,\" Henry admits. \u201cThe part that is really hard for me \u2014 that I\u2019m still fighting with \u2014 is when they tell me they\u2019re fans of my stuff and I\u2019m just like, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 I literally say it to their face.\u201d",
      "The biggest revelation about working alongside these accomplished actors is that Henry is now one of them.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, now, these are my peers, these are my contemporaries, and I can\u2019t continue to act like they\u2019re not. I can\u2019t continue to act like I have to shrink myself to fit in these spaces. I no longer have to do that. And what I also love is that they\u2019ll reaffirm that for me, too ... and that's the great part.\u201d"

      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t a part of the first case",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's #MeToo retrial next month will largely be an abridged version of the original, with one big addition: a charge based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the first case.",
      "But at a key pretrial hearing Wednesday, the disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers cautioned that because Weinstein\u2019s 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction was overturned, the past isn't prologue \u2014 it's almost entirely irrelevant.",
      "\u201cWe can take that transcript and all the judge\u2019s rulings and throw them in the garbage,\" Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Arthur Aidala, argued. \u201cThat trial was declared illegal by the highest court in this state.\"",
      "New York\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction last year, setting the stage for a retrial starting April 15 in state court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say it could take about five weeks.",
      "How the retrial will play out began to take shape Wednesday as Judge Curtis Farber ruled on a number of outstanding issues, including expert testimony and the language used to describe the accusers.",
      "Farber granted a prosecution request to call a psychologist, Dawn Hughes, as an expert witness on the psychological and traumatic effects of rape and sexual assault. Hughes previously testified for actor Amber Heard at Johnny Depp\u2019s libel trial against Heard in 2022 and as a prosecution witness in singer R. Kelly\u2019s federal sex trafficking trial in Brooklyn in 2021.",
      "The judge also granted a defense request to preclude the term \u201csurvivor\u201d from being used to describe Weinstein\u2019s accusers. He told prosecutors to instruct any police officers who testify to refer to the women as \u201ccomplaining witnesses\" instead.",
      "While Weinstein\u2019s convictions from the first trial were thrown out, his acquittals on the most serious charges \u2014 two counts of predatory sexual assault and first-degree, or forcible, rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Given that, Farber ordered prosecutors to instruct one of the accusers testifying at the retrial not to used the word \u201cforce\u201d when describing her alleged assault.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office had wanted to exclude any mention of Weinstein\u2019s acquittals and vacated conviction, but Farber said he could be obligated to clue them in depending on how the accuser testifies.",
      "\u201cDoes she have to use the word force? She can describe what happened and let the jury draw its own conclusions?\u201d the judge asked. \u201cI am not asking her to change her testimony from the first trial. I am asking her to refrain from using the word force.\"",
      "Other decisions were made behind closed doors as Farber met with the prosecution and defense for more than an hour in his chambers to discuss matters still under seal.",
      "They included a prosecution request that two of the three accusers in the case be allowed to testify about other alleged encounters with Weinstein. They also discussed evidence of the accusers' sexual history, which prosecutors say should be barred under New York's Rape Shield Law.",
      "Weinstein, 72, was in court for Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, arriving from jail in a wheelchair and suit and holding a stack of documents. Before the public portion of his hearing began, the ex-studio boss watched as Farber spent a few minutes resolving another matter that had been delayed by their closed-door discussions.",
      "At his last court appearance in January, Weinstein had implored Farber to start the retrial sooner.",
      "He told the judge \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on\u201d with cancer, heart issues and harsh conditions at New York City\u2019s Rikers Island jail complex, where he is locked up. Farber said he may hold jury selection a few days sooner if a murder trial he's overseeing wraps up ahead of schedule.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013. The additional charge, filed last September, alleges he forced oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "Prosecutors said in court papers that the woman, who has not been identified publicly, came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison, but they revisited them and secured a new indictment after his conviction was thrown out.",
      "Farber ruled in October to combine the new indictment and existing charges into one trial.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors prejudiced him by waiting nearly five years to bring the additional charge, suggesting they had elected not to include the allegation in his first trial so they could use it later if his conviction were reversed.",
      "Weinstein has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone.",
      "In vacating Weinstein\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M. Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench and such testimony won't be part of the retrial.",
      "Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial.",

    "story": [
      "The hero at the heart of \u201cNovocaine\u201d can't feel pain",
      "Nathan Caine may not be able to feel pain, as the tagline for the new action-comedy \u201cNovocaine\u201d reads, but the same does not apply to audiences.",
      "Although he doesn\u2019t scream when his leg is impaled with an arrow or when he sticks his hand in a vat of frying oil, you might. I certainly did. Out loud. In a theater. With other people. There may have been some phrases uttered entirely involuntarily too. Were other people reacting in the same way, I wonder? I couldn\u2019t hear them over my own groans. Hooray for the communal experience, I guess?",
      "This is, in some ways, a film for people who thought John Wick wasn\u2019t stabby enough. It delights in the relentless mutilation of its hero, a regular guy (played by Jack Quaid ) with a rare condition that has rendered him immune from feeling any sort of discomfort to bodily harm. Unlike such high concept premises as \u201cCrank,\u201d congenital insensitivity to pain analgesia (or CIPA) is actually real. But it\u2019s not exactly a superpower, Nate explains. He can still die; it just might be because he hasn\u2019t emptied his bladder in many hours. Or because he's accidentally bitten his tongue off eating a sandwich. These are real concerns of his.",
      "His entire existence is devoted to preventing these kinds of crises, mostly through tried-and-true baby proofing techniques like using tennis balls on sharp corners. Like Kelly Ripa before a show, he only consumes \u201cnon-chewing food.\u201d",
      "Work is stable and dull as an assistant manager at a bank. And dating is out of the question; He spends most of his free time playing online video games. Quaid, even with his two movie star parents, is somehow believable as this cautious introvert, though everything is played with a light touch and a wink. The movie, written by Lars Jacobson and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, even begins with the mournful R.E.M. anthem \u201cEverybody Hurts.\u201d",
      "Then Nate\u2019s life is changed one day when a pretty teller at the bank, Sherry (Amber Midthunder), asks him out to lunch, then to drinks and even spends the night. The next morning, things get even crazier: Sherry is taken hostage after a violent robbery at the bank. These guys are capital B bad (led by fellow nepo spawn Ray Nicholson) killing both the bank manager the cops outside. So what does Nate do? He steals a cop car and attempts to save her himself.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d pleads an injured cop as Nate hesitates before apprehending the car. It\u2019s hard to argue with the cop: Why not just let the professionals handle it, understaffed though they may be over the Christmas holiday? It would be a rather short and pointless movie if he did just leave it to the cops, but the impetus for this quest is a stretch to say the least. The conceit is missing some extra justification of why he felt like he was the only one who could do it, especially once he actually talks to said cops (Betty Gabriel and Matt Walsh).",
      "Like many things in \u201cNovocaine,\u201d it simply exists to open more avenues for his torture. This involves a fight in a restaurant kitchen, a visit to a tattoo parlor to get more information on one of the robbers, and a stop by a booby-trapped house. The script is self-aware enough to throw in a \u201cHome Alone\u201d reference, though not before you\u2019ve made one in your head.",
      "On the heels of some bad action comedies like \u201cLove Hurts,\u201d \u201cNovocaine\u201d is pretty enjoyable. It might have been born in the same elevator pitch incubator (what if non-stop violence!), but it\u2019s executed with some style and understanding of comedic timing.

      "A proposed 100,000-seater arena would surpass Wembley as the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Under the plans, the 20-time English champion said it would build next to its iconic Old Trafford ground, likely meaning it would not need to relocate during the construction process.",
      "\u201cOur current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport,\u201d part owner Jim Ratcliffe said. \u201cBy building next to the existing site, we will be able to preserve the essence of Old Trafford, while creating a truly state-of-the-art stadium that transforms the fan experience only footsteps from our historic home.\u201d",
      "United did not say how much the stadium would cost or reveal a timeline for its completion, but architect Norman Foster said building work would take five years.",
      "British billionaire Ratcliffe paid $1.3 billion for an initial 25% stake in United last year and made a new stadium one of his priorities.",
      "The possibility of redeveloping Old Trafford, one of the most iconic stadiums in soccer, was considered but an entirely new construction was the preferred option.",
      "\u201cToday marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world\u2019s greatest football stadium,\u201d Ratcliffe said.",
      "United wants the venue to be part of a wider project to regenerate the surrounding Old Trafford area, which it said would be worth 7.3 billion pounds ($9.4 billion) to the U.K. economy. The U.K. government has already voiced its support for the project, although the specifics of how it would be funded are not known.",
      "Wembley is currently the biggest stadium in the U.K., with a capacity of 90,000, and is home to England\u2019s national soccer team.",
      "Twickenham, which is home to the national rugby team, holds 82,500.",
      "Old Trafford is the country\u2019s biggest dedicated soccer stadium with a capacity of just over 74,000, but is dated in comparison to the likes of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, which regularly hosts NFL games.",
      "\u201cOur long-term objective as a club is to have the world\u2019s best football team playing in the world\u2019s best stadium,\" United chief executive Omar Berrada said.",
      "Managerial great Alex Ferguson said the club \"must be brave and seize this opportunity to build a new home, fit for the future, where new history can be made.\"",
      "The announcement came days after thousands of United fans marched in protest against the club's ownership in the face of cost cuts, ticket price rises and ongoing failure on the field.",
      "United is majority owned by the American Glazer family, which also owns the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Upon investing, Ratcliffe vowed to return the once-dominant club back to the summit of European soccer after more than a decade since it last won the Premier League.",
      "But his first year in charge of soccer operations has been turbulent. United endured its worst-ever Premier League season last year and is on course to set a new low this term, with the team currently languishing in the bottom half of the standings.",

      "Court administrators announced Mary Marlowe Sommer\u2019s upcoming retirement on Thursday. She will step down at the end of May after serving 15 years on the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe, New Mexico. She served as the district's chief judge from 2019 to 2022.",

      "The trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins\u2019 killing.

      "She also presided over the child molestation cases of former teacher Gary Gregor, and the trial of Jeannine Jaramillo, who killed a police officer and retired firefighter during a wrong-way crash while attempting to evade law enforcement.",
      "Marlowe Sommer's term was set to expire in 2028. A judicial nominating commission will consider applicants for the vacancy and recommend to the governor for an appointment to serve the remainder of the term."

      "Festival organizers announced the lineup on Thursday, including the headline acts, for arguably the world\u2019s most famous music festival. This year, it will take place at Worthy Farm from June 25 to June 29.",
      "The main news is that English band The 1975 will headline the main Pyramid Stage on the festival's Friday night, while American singer and actress Olivia Rodrigo will take top billing on the Sunday evening.",
      "Neil Young, the legendary 79-year-old Canadian-American singer-songwriter, was previously announced as the headliner for the Saturday night, while his Scottish peer Rod Stewart had been confirmed for the coveted legends slot on the Pyramid Stage on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Not making the top of the bill, but very much in vogue and likely to draw huge crowds, is Charli XCX, who will perform on the Other Stage on the Saturday night. Last week, the singer behind the \u201cBrat summer\" phenomenon, won five Brit awards.",
      "The word \u201cbrat,\u201d used by the singer as the title of her sixth studio album, was declared word of the year by Collins Dictionary. For those not in the know, it's been defined as \u201ccharacterized by a confident, independent, and hedonistic attitude.\u201d",
      "Closing out the Other Stage on the festival's Sunday night will be English electronic group The Prodigy, most famous for the pumping 1996 track \u201cFirestarter.\" The performance will be particularly poignant as it will mark the band's first at the festival since the death of frontman Keith Flint in 2019.",
      "Other acts include Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, making her Glastonbury debut, and the recently reformed U.S. pop group Scissor Sisters.",

      "Last month, a London judge ruled that the band cannot be held personally liable for losses of a Malaysian music festival that was shut down by authorities after lead singer Healy kissed a male bandmate on stage. The organizers of the Good Vibes Festival were claiming 1.9 million pounds ($2.4 million) in losses after Healy criticized the country\u2019s anti-homosexuality laws and then kissed bassist Ross MacDonald at the Kuala Lumpur show in July 2023.",
      "Footage of the kiss sparked a backlash in the predominantly Muslim country, where homosexuality is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning. Some LGBTQ+ groups also criticized the band for endangering its community and disrupting the work of activists pushing for change.",
      "There will be more acts named over the coming weeks and those who haven't got tickets yet will be able to do so in a resale. As always, the festival, which was first held in 1970, was sold out quickly despite the ticket price \u2014 nearly 380 pounds ($490) each.",
      "While the price may be fixed, the mid-summer weather isn't. As always, the hopes of everyone going are the same: Please, no mudbath!"

      "The Trump Administration's quest to \u201cMake America Health Again\u201d is targeting ultraprocessed foods",
      "In the Trump administration\u2019s quest to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d there may be no bigger target than ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation\u2019s new health secretary, has cited \u201chighly chemically processed foods\u201d as a chief culprit behind an epidemic of chronic disease in the U.S., including ailments such as obesity, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",
      "Such foods are \u201cpoisoning\u201d people, particularly children, Kennedy said during Senate confirmation hearings. He has vowed to work to remove such foods from federal programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "\u201cI will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\u201d he told lawmakers.",
      "Key to that goal, however, could be making sure that consumers understand basic facts about ultraprocessed foods and the role they play in daily meals.",
      "From sugary cereals at breakfast to frozen pizzas at dinner, plus in-between snacks of potato chips, sodas and ice cream, ultraprocessed foods make up about 60% of the U.S. diet. For kids and teens, it\u2019s even higher \u2014 about two-thirds of what they eat.",
      "That\u2019s concerning because ultraprocessed foods have been linked to a host of negative health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. One recent study suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of early death.",
      "Nutrition science is tricky, though, and most research so far has found connections, not proof, regarding the health consequences of these foods.",
      "Food manufacturers argue that processing boosts food safety and supplies and offers a cheap, convenient way to provide a diverse and nutritious diet.",
      "Even if the science were clear, it\u2019s hard to know what practical advice to give when ultraprocessed foods account for what one study estimates is more than 70% of the U.S. food supply.",
      "The Associated Press asked several nutrition experts and here\u2019s what they said:",
      "Most foods are processed, whether it\u2019s by freezing, grinding, fermentation, pasteurization or other means. In 2009, Brazilian epidemiologist Carlos Monteiro and colleagues first proposed a system that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo, not by nutrient content.",
      "At the top of the four-tier scale are foods created through industrial processes and with ingredients such as additives, colors and preservatives that you couldn\u2019t duplicate in a home kitchen, said Kevin Hall, a researcher who focuses on metabolism and diet at the National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cThese are most, but not all, of the packaged foods you see,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Such foods are often made to be both cheap and irresistibly delicious, said Dr. Neena Prasad, director of the Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019 Food Policy Program.",
      "\u201cThey have just the right combination of sugar, salt and fat and you just can\u2019t stop eating them,\u201d Prasad said",
      "However, the level of processing alone doesn\u2019t determine whether a food is unhealthy or not, Hall noted. Whole-grain bread, yogurt, tofu and infant formula are all highly processed, for instance, but they\u2019re also nutritious.",
      "Here\u2019s the tricky part. Many studies suggest that diets high in such foods are linked to negative health outcomes. But these kinds of studies can\u2019t say whether the foods themselves are the cause of the negative effects \u2014 or whether there\u2019s something else about the people who eat these foods that might be responsible.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods, as a group, tend to have higher amounts of sodium, saturated fat and sugar, and tend to be lower in fiber and protein. It\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s just these nutrients that are driving the effects.",
      "Hall and his colleagues were the first to conduct a small but influential experiment that directly compared the results of eating similar diets made of ultraprocessed versus unprocessed foods.",
      "Published in 2019, the research included 20 adults who went to live at an NIH center for a month. They received diets of ultraprocessed and unprocessed foods matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients for two weeks each and were told to eat as much as they liked.",
      "When participants ate the diet of ultraprocessed foods, they consumed about 500 calories per day more than when they ate unprocessed foods, researchers found \u2014 and they gained an average of about 2 pounds (1 kilogram) during the study period. When they ate only unprocessed foods for the same amount of time, they lost about 2 pounds (1 kilogram).",
      "Hall is conducting a more detailed study now, but the process is slow and costly and results aren\u2019t expected until late next year. He and others argue that such definitive research is needed to determine exactly how ultraprocessed foods affect consumption.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s better to understand the mechanisms by which they drive the deleterious health consequences, if they\u2019re driving them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some advocates, like Prasad, argue that the large body of research linking ultraprocessed foods to poor health should be more than enough to spur government and industry to change policies. She calls for actions such as increased taxes on sugary drinks, stricter sodium restrictions for manufacturers and cracking down on marketing of such foods to children.",
      "\u201cDo we want to risk our kids getting sicker while we wait for this perfect evidence to emerge?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Last year, former FDA Commissioner Robert Califf broached the subject, telling a conference of food policy experts that ultraprocessed foods are \u201cone of the most complex things I\u2019ve ever dealt with.\u201d",
      "But, he concluded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the scientific basis and then we\u2019ve got to follow through.\u201d",
      "In countries like the U.S., it\u2019s hard to avoid highly processed foods \u2014 and it's not clear which ones should be targeted, said Aviva Musicus, science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates for food policies.",

      "President Trump's nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is getting ready to appear before Congress",
      "NEW YORK -- Dr. David Weldon had been out of the national spotlight for more than 15 years when he was nominated to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But many anti-vaccine advocates knew him well.",
      "\u201cHe is one of us!! Since before our movement had momentum,\u201d the co-director of Mississippi Parents for Vaccine Rights wrote on Facebook. And on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Autism Action Network credited the former congressman with introducing legislation two decades ago \u201cto stop the vaccine pedocide.\u201d",
      "Weldon, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can lead the nation\u2019s top public health agency. His confirmation hearing is to be held Thursday.",
      "The 71-year-old retired Florida congressman is considered to be closely aligned with his presumptive boss, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who for years has been one of the nation's leading anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials declined to make Weldon or Kennedy available for an Associated Press interview.",
      "When he made the nomination announcement, Trump said Weldon \u201cwill proudly restore the CDC to its true purpose, and will work to end the Chronic Disease Epidemic, and Make America Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",
      "Today, the Atlanta-based agency has a more than $9 billion core budget. It had about 13,000 employees when Trump took office, but more than 500 were fired as part of a dramatic \u2014 and continuing \u2014 push by the president and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk to cut staffing across federal agencies.",
      "Weldon has no experience in federal public heath, but that isn't unusual. The last few presidential administrations \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 have appointed outsiders with no CDC experience.",
      "Unlike Weldon, however, those outsiders had been public health researchers or had run state health departments. He is an Army veteran and internal medicine doctor whose main claim to fame was representing a central Florida district in Congress from 1995 to 2009.",
      "After he left Congress, Weldon practiced medicine in Florida, taught at the Florida Institute of Technology, served as board chairman for the Israel Allies Foundation and made unsuccessful runs at federal and state elected office. In a March 1 letter to HHS, Weldon said that if confirmed he will resign from the foundation and from two Florida health-care organizations. He also promised to sell his holdings in funds investing in energy, pharmaceutical and health-care companies.",
      "Weldon was a leader of a Congressional push for research into autism\u2019s causes, which began around 2000. It was fueled by a controversial \u2014 and ultimately discredited \u2014 study by British researcher Dr. Andrew Wakefield that claimed to find a link between the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and autism.",
      "The action in Congress was driven largely by U.S. Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican whose grandson had autism. Weldon was a prominent voice in Burton\u2019s hearings and co-sponsored a bill that would give responsibility for the nation\u2019s vaccine safety to an independent agency within HHS \u2014 an idea that not everyone in public health opposes.",
      "But Weldon also rejected studies that found no causal link between childhood vaccines and autism, and accused the CDC of short-circuiting research that might show otherwise.",
      "Meanwhile, Weldon was a friend to practitioners of fringe medicine. When Weldon invited Wakefield to testify before Congress, he also brought in Dr. James \u201cJeff\u201d Bradstreet, who used alternative medicine to try to treat autistic children. Bradstreet died in 2015, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raided his office, of a gunshot wound that police labeled a suicide.",
      "Weldon later appeared in \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\u201d a 2016 documentary directed by Wakefield and produced by Del Bigtree, an activist who later became the manager of Kennedy\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign. In the movie, Weldon repeated suspicions and accusations about CDC that he\u2019d made as a congressman.",
      "Kennedy has argued that experts who advise the CDC on vaccine policy have conflicts from working with, or receiving money from, pharmaceutical companies. Those advisers routinely disclose conflicts in public meetings, but the CDC last week launched a web tool \u201cto increase the transparency of conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Democrats are likely to press Weldon on his vaccine views and his plans for the agency under a health secretary who has shown disdain for it.",
      "Dr. Anne Schuchat worked at the CDC for 33 years before retiring in 2021, and twice served as acting director. She said she doesn\u2019t know Weldon, but that agency directors gradually develop an appreciation and respect for its work.",
      "If Weldon follows a similar pattern, she said, he could be a great asset: His Capitol Hill experience could help CDC secure funding and political support.",
      "\u201cWith an optimistic view, there\u2019s lot you can build on, with what he has on paper,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a pessimistic view, if he wants the job to tear the place down, that would be disappointing \u2014 and dangerous.\u201d",

      "The Connecticut Supreme Court has upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in 2015, in a case that drew widespread attention because of evidence from the victim's Fitbit exercise activity tracker",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Despite finding \u201cimproprieties\u201d were committed by a prosecutor, the Connecticut Supreme Court on Monday upheld the murder conviction of a man found guilty of killing his wife in a case that drew wide attention because the victim's Fitbit exercise tracker contradicted his statements to police.",
      "The justices ruled in a 6-0 decision that Richard Dabate was not deprived of a fair trial because of four missteps by the prosecutor they called \u201ctroubling,\u201d including referring to one of Connecticut's most notorious crimes while cross-examining the man.",
      "Dabate, 48, was convicted of murder and other charges in the fatal shooting of Connie Dabate, 39, at the couple's home in Ellington two days before Christmas in 2015 while their two young sons were in school. He's serving a 65-year prison sentence.",
      "Prosecutors said Dabate wanted his wife dead, in part, because he had a yearslong affair with another woman who was pregnant at the time of the killing and later gave birth to their child.",
      "Dabate staged a phony crime scene, including tying himself up loosely with zip ties and stabbing himself with a box cutter, and told police an unknown intruder in camouflage broke into their home, killed his wife and assaulted him, authorities said.",
      "State police said Dabate gave them a timeline of events that conflicted with data on his wife\u2019s Fitbit, which showed she was moving around for about an hour after the time Dabate said she was shot.",
      "Dabate testified in his defense and maintained his innocence, saying a large masked man with a voice like actor Vin Diesel was the killer.",
      "Part of Dabate's appeal questioned the reliability of the Fitbit evidence and whether the trial judge was wrong to have allowed it, but the Supreme Court upheld the data and its use.",
      "Dabate also accused Tolland State's Attorney Matthew Gedansky of multiple instances of impropriety, including Gedansky mentioning a notorious home invasion in Cheshire in 2007 while cross-examining Dabate. The home invaders killed a woman and her two daughters, ages 11 and 17, after terrorizing them for hours, while the woman's husband survived a vicious beating.",
      "Gedansky asked Dabate if he was trying to create a \u201clittle mini-Cheshire scene\u201d in his own home. The trial judge upheld an objection by Dabate's lawyer and asked Gedansky to rephrase the question, but Gedansky asked nearly the same exact question. The Supreme Court found Gedansky violated the judge's order to rephrase.",
      "\u201cIn referring to a \u2018mini Cheshire,\u2019 the prosecutor\u2019s question was unnecessarily inflammatory because it compared the defendant to other notorious offenders or infamous figures,\u201d Justice Joan Alexander wrote in the decision.",
      "Gedansky and Dabate's lawyer, Trent LaLima, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment Monday.",
      "The Supreme Court also found that Gedansky committed three other improprieties, including suggesting that the jury would have to be unintelligent or lazy to agree with the defense theory of the case.",
      "\u201cWe disapprove of the improprieties committed by the prosecutor during the trial of this case in strong and unqualified terms and expect our message to be taken with the utmost seriousness by prosecutors,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The court said it agreed with Dabate that \u201cthe prosecutor engaged in multiple acts of impropriety at trial that we consider troubling.\u201d",
      "Justices, however, said the state's case was very strong and Gedansky's missteps did not overshadow testimony by 130 witnesses and the 600 exhibits presented during the five-week trial."

      "Utah's governor intends to sign legislation making the state the first to ban fluoride in public water systems",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah will become the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite widespread opposition from dentists and national health organizations.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he would sign legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Government researchers have found that community water fluoridation prevents about 25% of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got tried and true evidence of the safety and efficacy of this public health initiative,\u201d said American Dental Association President Brad Kessler, of Denver. Cavities could start emerging in children within months or years of Utah stopping fluoridation, Kessler said.",
      "The ban comes weeks after federal health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed skepticism about water fluoridation, was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cIt's not a bill I care that much about,\u201d Cox added, \u201cbut it's a bill I will sign.\u201d",
      "Utah lawmakers who pushed for a ban said putting fluoride in water was too expensive. Its Republican sponsor, Rep. Stephanie Gricius, acknowledged fluoride has benefits, but said it was an issue of \u201cindividual choice\u201d to not have it in the water.",
      "Cox said that like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his own children in a community that doesn\u2019t have fluoridated water \u2014 or what he called a \u201cnatural experiment.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou would think you would see drastically different outcomes with half the state not getting it. We haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Cox said in a weekend interview with ABC4 in Salt Lake City. \u201cSo it\u2019s got to be a really high bar for me if we\u2019re going to require people to be medicated by their government.\u201d",
      "Already, some cities across the country have gotten rid of fluoride from their water, and other municipalities are considering doing the same. A few months ago, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate fluoride in drinking water because high levels could pose a risk to kids\u2019 intellectual development.",
      "A Utah teenager who urged lawmakers to pass the bill described suffering a medical emergency when the fluoride pump in Sandy, Utah, malfunctioned in 2019, releasing an excessive amount of the mineral into the drinking water. The fluoride sickened hundreds of residents and led many in Utah to push for its removal.",
      "It\u2019s rare to find high levels of fluoridation in water, according to the National Institutes of Health. The agency said it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose of fluoride from water with standard levels of the mineral.",
      "Kessler said the amounts of fluoride added to drinking water have been reduced over time and are below levels considered problematic.",
      "\u201cThe science proves that it is effective at reducing cavities with little to no risk of other problems,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that a ban in Utah could have a domino effect with other legislatures being encouraged to follow suit with fluoride bans in their states.",
      "Opponents warned it would disproportionately affect low-income residents who may rely on public drinking water having fluoride as their only source of preventative dental care. Low-income families may not be able to afford regular dentist visits or the fluoride tablets some people buy as a supplement in cities without fluoridation.",
      "Fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay on a large scale, said Lorna Koci, who chairs the Utah Oral Health Coalition.",
      "Utah in 2022 ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents that receive fluoridated water, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About two in five Utah residents served by community water systems received fluoridated water.",
      "In February, the city council in Riverton, a Salt Lake City suburb, unanimously passed a resolution to remove fluoride from the city\u2019s public water systems. Voters in Brigham City, 59 miles (95 kilometers) north of the capital city, struck down by a large margin a measure in 2023 that would have removed the mineral from its public water supply.",
      "Out of the 484 Utah water systems that reported data to the CDC in 2024, only 66 fluoridated their water, an Associated Press analysis showed. The largest was the state\u2019s biggest city, Salt Lake City.",
      "Rodney Thornell, president of the Utah Dental Association, began practicing dentistry in a Salt Lake City suburb before the city added fluoride to its water. His adult patients who grew up locally continue to get lots of cavities but younger patients who grew up with fluoride in the water get fewer, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep eating sugar, we need fluoride.\u201d Thornell said, noting that Utah residents consume more than the national average of candy and sugary drinks.",

      "Colorado is among roughly half the states that prohibit the practice of trying to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity through counseling.",
      "The issue is whether the law violates the speech rights of counselors. Defenders of such laws argue that they regulate the conduct of professionals who are licensed by the state.",

      "At the time, three justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, said they would have taken on the issue. It takes four justices to grant review. The nine-member court does not typically reveal how justices vote at this stage of a case so it\u2019s unclear who might have provided the fourth vote.",
      "The case will be argued in the court\u2019s new term, which begins in October.

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",

      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cYou can make changes in your backyard and in your neighborhood and in your state,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cThat could really improve the situation for a lot of species.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Marty Makary will answer questions from a Senate panel about his plans to lead the Food and Drug Administration",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration is set to answer Senate questions Thursday about his plans for the agency, which may soon be at the center of an administration plan to scrutinize vaccines, antidepressants and ultraprocessed foods.",
      "Dr. Marty Makary \u2014 a surgeon, author and researcher \u2014 is known for his contrarian views and outspoken criticism of the medical establishment. Like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Makary traces many of the health issues afflicting Americans to food additives, overprescribing of drugs and the influence of drugmakers, insurers and food companies.",
      "To become commissioner, he\u2019ll need a majority vote from members of the Senate\u2019s health committee, who will question him Thursday morning. A confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected later this month.",
      "The FDA has long been a target for Kennedy, who last year vowed to \u201cclear out\u201d entire departments at the agency, including those overseeing nutrition. Kennedy recently called for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d commission to review the safety of vaccines, antidepressants, stimulants and weight-loss drugs \u2014 all products regulated by the FDA \u2014 particularly in children.",
      "The approach has been lauded by most Republicans. But Senate Democrats are expected to push Makary on his willingness to break with Kennedy on key issues, including the safety and benefits of childhood vaccinations.",
      "FDA commissioners aren\u2019t typically involved in the agency\u2019s day-to-day scientific reviews, but they often serve as a buffer between FDA staff and political appointees elsewhere in government.",
      "For his part, Makary has been critical of the agency he would lead. While working as a Fox News contributor during COVID-19, he called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Despite such views, Makary is considered one of Trump\u2019s more conventional health nominees and is widely expected to be confirmed. Before the pandemic, Makary was mainly known for influential studies of medical errors, hospital costs and overprescribing of opioids.",
      "Headquartered in the suburbs outside Washington, the FDA oversees medical products plus billions of dollars in consumer goods, including most foods, cosmetics and vaping products.",
      "Makary would take over at a particularly turbulent period for the agency. Last month, the FDA abruptly fired hundreds of medical reviewers, researchers and inspectors, only to rehire some of them a week later. Several senior FDA officials have resigned or retired in recent months. The agency is also expected to lose more staffers to buyouts, further layoffs and return-to-office requirements.",
      "Among other issues facing the agency:",
      "\u2014 Pressure from anti-abortion groups to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone",
      "\u2014 Efforts to keep up with a wave of artificial intelligence-based medical systems",
      "\u2014 Legal battles with compounding pharmacies and telehealth companies over off-brand versions of weight-loss drugs",
      "In government ethics forms, Makary recently said he has cut financial ties with several companies that could be impacted by his work at FDA, including telehealth and drug companies that sell compounded versions of FDA-approved drugs.",

      "Authorities have revealed that actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease and showed severe signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease a full week after his wife died of hantavirus in their home",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) \u2014 Actor Gene Hackman died of heart disease a full week after his wife died from hantavirus in their New Mexico hillside home, likely unaware that she was dead because he was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, authorities revealed Friday.",
      "Both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, chief medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell said alongside state fire and health officials at a news conference.",
      "\u201cMr. Hackman showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Jarrell said. \u201cHe was in a very poor state of health. He had significant heart disease, and I think ultimately that\u2019s what resulted in his death.\u201d",
      "Authorities didn't suspect foul play after the bodies of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, were discovered Feb 26. Immediate tests for carbon monoxide poisoning were negative.",
      "Investigators found that the last known communication and activity from Arakawa was Feb. 11 when she visited a pharmacy, pet store and grocery before returning to their gated neighborhood that afternoon, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday.",
      "Hackman's pacemaker last showed signs of activity a week later and that he had an abnormal heart rhythm Feb. 18, the day he likely died, Jarrell said.",
      "Although there was no reliable way to determine the date and time when both died, all signs point to their deaths coming a week apart, Jarrell said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible he was not aware she was deceased,\u201d Jarrell said.",
      "Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, said he believes Hackman was severely impaired due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and unable to deal with his wife\u2019s death in the last week of his life.",
      "Most older Americans with dementia live at home, and many receive care from family or friends.",
      "Their bodies were found a little over a week later. Hackman was found in the home\u2019s entryway. His death was tied to heart disease with Alzheimer\u2019s disease contributing.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Authorities linked her death to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings. Thyroid medication pills prescribed to Arakawa were found nearby and weren\u2019t listed as contributing to her death, Jarrell said.",
      "Hantavirus typically is reported in spring and summer, often due to exposures that occur when people are near mouse droppings in homes, sheds or poorly ventilated areas. This is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in New Mexico this year.",
      "While hantavirus is found throughout the world, most cases in the U.S. have been found in western states. The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection.",
      "Jarrell said it was not known how quickly Arakawa died.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs survived. Authorities initially misidentified the breed.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, said Erin Phipps, a veterinarian with the New Mexico Health Department. The sheriff considers this an open investigation until they receive results of the dog's necropsy and finish checking into data from personal cellphones retrieved from the home.",
      "When Hackman and Arakawa were found, the bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe\u2019s especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).",
      "\u201cAll of us that knew him should have been checking on him,\u201d said Stuart Ashman, co-owner of Artes de Cuba gallery who cherished his encounters with Hackman at a local Pilates exercise studio, where they used to swap stories. \u201cI had no idea. ... It's just really sad. And that she died a week before him. My God.\u201d",
      "Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Virginia, said when two bodies are found at the same time, the usual assumption would be that they died at the same time. But Hackman\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s disease added a complicating factor: He apparently was unable to seek help after his wife died.",
      "\u201cThey died several days apart: One dying of a viral infection, the hantavirus, which can kill quite quickly. And the other death occurring from heart disease. And that too can be a relatively sudden death,\" Weedn said. \"Their (the authorities\u2019) explanation, I thought, was quite clear and plausible. I believe they really discovered what truly happened in this case.\u201d",
      "Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cHoosiers\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.",
      "Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.",
      "Hackman dedicated much of his time in retirement to painting and writing novels far from Hollywood\u2019s social circuit. He served for several years on the board of trustees at the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, and he and his wife were investors in local businesses.",

      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life",
      "NEW YORK -- It took five years for Crystal Burke to put a name to the symptoms that haunted her.",
      "Heart palpitations. Insomnia so severe she slept only two to four hours a night. A newfound struggle to make decisions in her job as a nurse. Confusion when dealing with statistics, which she used to handle with ease.",
      "\u201cIt affected my work, it affected my relationships, it affected everything,\" Burke said. \"I felt lost. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody about it.\u201d",
      "Then Burke saw an advertisement about a face cream which contained estrogen, one of the two hormones ovaries produce less and less of with aging. She began talking with friends about her symptoms. And she connected the dots: menopause.",
      "At just 38, Burke had thought she was too young to be going through the life stage when menstrual periods stop and women no longer can become pregnant. But menopause is more than the pop culture stereotype featuring women in their 50s having hot flashes. Symptoms can start much earlier \u2014 during perimenopause, the time leading up to menopause \u2014 and go well beyond hot flashes.",
      "The many manifestations include insomnia, migraines, brain fog, loss of concentration, memory problems, mood swings, depression, anxiety, heart palpitations, hair loss and weight gain. If that wasn\u2019t enough, some people experience heavy, painful periods or recurring urinary tract infections.",
      "Chronic insomnia can make it difficult to concentrate. Brain fog leaves the afflicted struggling to find words during meetings. But social stigma and a lack of information have left menopausal people dealing alone with severe symptoms that may impact their work. Many stay silent, fearing they\u2019ll be viewed as underperformers or weak.",
      "Some women in senior leadership positions leave their jobs or reduce their hours as a result of debilitating side effects from menopause, said Lauren Redfern, executive director of Hormonally, a nonprofit that provides workplace training and education about women\u2019s health. But those who feel supported by employers during the transition are more likely to remain at work, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you open up a space to talk about these things, people are desperate to have a conversation,\u201d Redfern said. \u201cThe symptoms are so diverse and so far-reaching and so prolific they impact every area of someone\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "Menopause affects about half the world\u2019s population at some point in life. Yet due to the epidemic of silence around it, women, nonbinary people and transgender individuals often don't recognize the onset of unpleasant physical and emotional changes as side effects of declining hormone levels.",
      "Finding health care providers who are trained to identify and treat their symptoms can be challenging. Some startups have sought to change that by providing access to referrals or telehealth appointments with doctors or therapists who specialize in treating menopausal patients.",
      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t know that something can get fixed, it\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Midi Health founder Joanna Strober, whose company connects women with professionals who understand menopause. \u201dIf you think, \u2018For the rest of my life I\u2019m going to have brain fog and not remember anyone\u2019s name, and I\u2019m going to keep losing my car in the parking lot and I\u2019m going to keep gaining weight,\u2019 then it\u2019s very demoralizing.\u201d",
      "Burke found relief when she began hormone replacement therapy. Inspired to help others, she co-founded The Menopause Clinic in Louisiana to offer telehealth services focused on menopause.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is for women to know what perimenopause is, what menopause is, and that there are options,\u201d Burke said. \u201cThe suffering isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d",
      "Hormone replacement therapy is not an option for those with certain medical histories, and some doctors are unwilling to prescribe it. Some experts recommend acupuncture, dietary changes and exercise to help manage symptoms.",
      "The Mayo Clinic estimates that menopause symptoms lead to $1.8 billion in lost work time per year in the U.S. About 5% of employers offer menopause benefits or accommodations such as the ability to work from home or a cool room, according to benefit consulting company NFP.",
      "Here are some steps you or your employer can take to make the workplace more hospitable for people experiencing menopause.",
      "Finding supportive colleagues can help bridge knowledge gaps. If your organization doesn't have a menopause support group, you can start one. Once established, the group or human resources department can bring in facilitators to teach the entire workforce \u2014 not just women \u2014 about menopause.",
      "Sarah Daniels, a communications manager, started a support group called \u201cMenopause Matters\u201d at Arriva Group, a U.K.-based public transportation company. The male-dominated company already had a gender inclusion group, so Daniels joined and organized the menopause group as an offshoot.",
      "The group's monthly meetings are held online during business hours. Participants swap notes on supplements, teas, treatments and beauty products. Daniels believes the group improves productivity because it gives members a sense of belonging within the organization.",
      "\u201cI know how lonely it is when you are going through these things, because you think, \u2018Is this just happening to me?'\" she said. \u201cI had a UTI (urinary tract infection) that was so severe that I fainted on a train. My periods were so heavy that I couldn\u2019t leave the house.\u201d",
      "Arriva has a policy that says bosses must listen to and make reasonable adjustments for employees struggling with menopause. That could mean more restroom breaks, uniform adaptations to help with hot flashes or flexible working hours, Daniels said.",
      "People working for employers who do not subsidize menopause-related care and programs can model requests for similar benefits after the small percentage of companies that do.",
      "When Shevonya Noble joined biotechnology firm Genentech as a principal quality and compliance leader, she was connected with a care advocate who helped her find a nutritionist, wellness coach, career coach, mental health provider and physical support coach to address her menopause symptoms.",
      "Appointment costs were covered through a benefit provided by Maven, which partners with employers and health plans to deliver care targeted to women. Genentech\u2019s benefits also include menopause-specific classes and support groups.",
      "At a former employer, Noble felt she had to hide the hot flashes that interrupted her sleep and disrupted her concentration while giving presentations because she didn't see anyone else furiously fanning themselves at their desks.",
      "\u201cThe conversation about menopause needs to be broadened to include men, not just men in our lives but in the workplace as well,\u201d Noble said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we not shy away from the topic but include it in our conversations and to just take the mystique away from what goes on with women at this stage in life.\u201d",
      "Speaking up about symptoms also may help. When women experience hot flashes and brain fog at work, they\u2019re often seen as less competent, but if they say, \u201cIt\u2019s menopausal, I\u2019m getting treated for it,\u2019\u201d the discrimination goes away and they\u2019re seen as powerful leaders again, according to Midi founder Strober.",
      "\u201cYou have to call it out. You have to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a hot flash,\u2019 not just look sweaty in a meeting, because then they just discount you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you call it out, you can take your power back.\u201d",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case",
      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "WASHINGTON -- Rural cancer patients may miss out on cutting-edge treatments in Utah. Therapies for intellectual disorders could stall in Maryland. Red states and blue states alike are poised to lose jobs in research labs and the local businesses serving them.",
      "Ripple effects of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on U.S. biomedical research promise to reach every corner of America. It's not just about scientists losing their jobs or damaging the local economy their work indirectly supports \u2014 scientists around the country say it's about patient health.",
      "\u201cDiscoveries are going to be delayed, if they ever happen,\u201d said Dr. Kimryn Rathmell, former director of the National Cancer Institute.",
      "It\u2019s hard for patients to comprehend how they could lose an undiscovered cure.",
      "Yet \u201call the people out there who have, you know, sick parents, sick children, this is going to impact,\u201d said neuroscientist Richard Huganir of Johns Hopkins University.",
      "The administration\u2019s unprecedented moves are upending the research engine that has made the U.S. \u201cthe envy of the world in terms of scientific innovation,\u201d said Georgetown University health policy expert Lawrence Gostin.",
      "Among the biggest blows, if it survives a court challenge: Massive cuts in funding from the National Institutes of Health that would cost jobs in every state, according to an analysis by The Associated Press with assistance from the nonprofit United for Medical Research.",
      "That\u2019s on top of mass firings of government workers, NIH delays in issuing grants and uncertainty about how many already funded studies are being canceled under the president's anti-diversity executive orders.",
      "Earlier this week, lawmakers pressured Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the nominee to become NIH director, about the turmoil. Bhattacharya said if confirmed, he'd look into it to ensure scientists employed by and funded by the agency \u201chave resources to do the lifesaving work they do.\u201d",
      "Patients who live in rural counties are 10% more likely to die of their cancer than those living in metropolitan areas, said Neli Ulrich of the University of Utah\u2019s Huntsman Cancer Institute.",
      "A third of patients travel more than 150 miles for care at the Salt Lake City cancer center. But for patients even further away \u2014 in Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming \u2014 because it\u2019s also the regional hub for NIH-funded studies of new treatments.",
      "So Ulrich\u2019s center helps train local doctors to do at least some of the blood tests and other steps of clinical trials that let faraway patients participate without traveling \u2014 a program threatened if her university loses tens of millions in NIH cuts.",
      "The issue: Most of the NIH\u2019s budget \u2014 more than $35 billion a year \u2014 goes to universities, hospitals and other research groups. The grants are divided into \u201cdirect costs\u201d \u2014 covering researchers\u2019 salaries and a project\u2019s supplies \u2014 and \u201cindirect costs,\u201d to reimburse other expenses supporting the work such as electricity, maintenance and janitorial staff, and safety and ethics oversight.",
      "NIH directly negotiates with research groups, a process that grants managers say requires receipts and audits, to set rates for those indirect expenses that can reach 50% or more. But the Trump administration now plans to cap those rates at 15%. The administration estimates it would save the government $4 billion a year but scientists say it really means they'll have to stop some lifesaving work.",
      "They are \u201creal expenses, that\u2019s the critical point \u2013 they are not fluff,\u201d said Ulrich. Using separate cancer center funds to cover those costs would threaten other \u201cactivities that are really important to us in serving our communities across the mountain West.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has blocked the move but until the court fight is done researchers aren\u2019t sure what they can continue to afford.",
      "NIH grants divided between researchers in every state in 2023 supported more than 412,000 jobs and $92 billion in new economic activity, according to a yearly report from United for Medical Research that often is cited as Congress sets the agency's budget.",
      "The AP tallied how much money would have been lost in each state under a 15% cap on those grants\u2019 indirect costs. Those lost dollars alone would have cost at least 58,000 jobs, concluded an analysis assisted by Inforum, a nonpartisan economic consulting firm that conducts UMR's economic impact reports.",
      "Consider Hopkins, which runs about 600 NIH-funded clinical trials plus other laboratory research and is Baltimore\u2019s largest private employer. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do science and we can\u2019t support the science, we can\u2019t support the surrounding community either,\u201d Huganir said.",
      "Huganir studies how the brain stores memory as people learn when he discovered a gene that, when mutated, causes certain intellectual disabilities.",
      "After years studying the SynGap1 gene, \u201cwe have what we think is a really great therapeutic\u201d almost ready to be tested in severely affected children. Huganir has applied for two new NIH grants key for moving toward those trials.",
      "\u201cThe problem is for the kids, there\u2019s a window of time to treat them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time.\u201d",
      "NIH reviews of new grant applications have been delayed despite court rulings to end a government spending freeze, and it\u2019s unclear how quickly they can get back on track.",
      "\u201cEveryone I know is basically freaking out because we suddenly don\u2019t know how much longer we\u2019ll be able to keep our labs open,\u201d said neuroscientist Rebecca Shansky at Boston\u2019s Northeastern University, who\u2019s awaiting word on grants for her study of how the brain processes pain and trauma.",
      "Even scientists with existing funding are left wondering if their projects \u2014 from transgender health to learning why white breast cancer patients in Oklahoma fare worse than Black patients in Massachusetts \u2014 will be caught in Trump\u2019s anti-diversity crackdown. Some already have, even though studying different populations is fundamental to medicine.",
      "\u201cThose studies are very much threatened right now. People don\u2019t know what the rules are,\u201d said well-known Hopkins specialist Dr. Otis Brawley. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to kill people is what it amounts to, because we\u2019re not studying how to get appropriate care to all people.\u201d",

      "",
      "\"Vitamin A is absolutely not a substitute nor an equivalent for MMR vaccination, which is the best way to prevent a child from getting measles,\" Ericka Hayes, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told MedPage Today.",
      "",

      "\"I think some people are thinking, 'Oh, well, then, if I, for example, take vitamin A, I won't get measles, or I'm less likely to get measles,'\" Hayes said. \"And that is absolutely not the case.\"",

      "Much of the literature about vitamin A and measles comes from lower- and middle-income countries, where deficiency may pose more of a problem. However, given that vitamin A deficiency can put kids at risk of worse outcomes with measles  --  and most kids aren't assessed for vitamin A levels  --  U.S. expert consensus has settled on administering the vitamin in all cases.",
      "",
      "Tina Tan, MD, of Northwestern University, who is president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said vitamin A \"really plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and supports the function of immune cells so the body can fight off infections like measles.\"",
      "",
      "However, taking vitamin A won't prevent a child from getting measles in the first place, Hayes said, and it can have \"significant toxicities,\" especially when taken in high doses. \"And just because you're taking vitamin A or have a good vitamin A level doesn't guarantee that you will not have a ... severe case of measles,\" she added.",

      "",
      "Tan said that the \"number of unvaccinated individuals is growing, and that basically increases the risk for spread of measles, because measles is one of the most contagious viruses.\"",

      "If you listen to some self-proclaimed exercise experts on social media, they swear that working out on an empty stomach burns more fat.",
      "But it\u2019s a common misconception that exercising in a fasted state improves performance or burns more calories, said Abby Langer, a dietitian in Toronto.",
      "\u201cThe research shows that in terms of gains, it doesn\u2019t really make much of a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "Does that mean you should load up on protein and carbs right before a workout? No, that\u2019s not true either.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at when \u2014 and how \u2014 you should eat, before, after or even during a workout. (And remember, experts say what you eat is more important than when you eat.)",
      "The calories in food literally are energy, so you need them to fuel your body for a proper workout. Eating too much too soon beforehand, though, can be problematic.",
      "Exercising diverts blood from organs including the stomach to the muscles, said Langer, author of \u201cGood Food, Bad Diet.\u201d So exercising on a full stomach affects the digestive process, which could cause cramping or even make you feel sick.",
      "That\u2019s particularly the case with meals high in fat, protein or fiber, which take longer to digest than carbohydrates. Langer recommends eating a high ratio of carbs beforehand and waiting two to three hours before intense exercise.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat a big steak an hour before you play hockey,\u201d she said.",
      "If you exercise first thing in the morning or before dinner, it\u2019s OK to have a carb-rich snack like a banana with peanut butter or yogurt with fruit beforehand. It will give you the energy to perform well, and you can fuel up afterward with a full meal.",
      "That steak may serve you better afterward because that\u2019s when a higher ratio of protein is easier to digest, said Krista Austin, a physiologist in Colorado Springs.",
      "Austin said if it will be an hour or longer before you can have a full meal, it\u2019s better to have a high-protein snack in the meantime to help curb your appetite. The reason has little to do with muscle recovery or nutrient absorption: Rather, people who are too hungry make poor dietary choices.",
      "\u201cA lot of people get very hungry about an hour after exercise, and you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Austin, author of \u201cPerformance Nutrition: Applying the Science of Nutrient Timing.\u201d \u201cYou want to catch it early, or you go and overeat.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s another myth that you need to grab a protein shake within minutes of finishing to build the biggest muscles, Langer said.",
      "Many exercise enthusiasts point to what\u2019s known as an \u201canabolic window\u201d of about an hour within exercising that the body is primed to repair muscle. For the average person, you have a much longer window, and nutrient timing is less important than making sure you consume some protein at every meal, Langer said. The body needs a continuous supply of amino acids like protein for muscle repair and maintenance, she said, which means about 25 to 30 grams at every meal, depending on various factors.",
      "\u201cPrioritizing that will help with goals, either muscle building, satiety, weight loss, all of that,\u201d Langer said.",
      "Most people who are eating enough throughout the day don\u2019t need anything during a workout. Langer and Austin said the threshold is about an hour of intense exercise. Longer than that \u2014 say you're training for a marathon \u2014 and you can benefit from a carb-rich snack in the middle.",
      "Instead of focusing on when to eat, Austin said to focus on what and how much. She cautioned against overcomplicating the topic and recommended following the USDA\u2019s My Plate recommendations for a balanced diet.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing we need to teach people is that nutrition is simple,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you need to stop focusing on the concept of nutrient timing and just make sure that you\u2019re consistently eating throughout the day and focus on health.\u201d",

The government withdrew the bill, but the protesters widened their demands to include direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders and police accountability.",
      "In response, Beijing imposed a national security law to quell the unrest. Under the law, many of the city's leading activists were prosecuted or convicted. Hong Kong government insists the law has restored the city's stability."

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Archaeologists in Cambodia are celebrating an unexpected find at the country\u2019s centuries-old Angkor temple complex: the torso of a statue of Buddha that matches a head found nearly a century ago at the same site.",
      "The torso, believed to be from the 12th or 13th century, was discovered during a dig by a team of Cambodian and Indian experts last month at Angkor\u2019s Ta Prohm temple. It was found along with 29 fragments that appeared to be part of the same statue, archaeologist Neth Simon said this week.",
      "It stands at 1.16 meters (3 3/4 feet) tall and is in the Bayon art style, associated with Angkor\u2019s Bayon temple.",
      "\u201cIt was a big surprise when we unearthed this sculpture because all we\u2019d found so far were small pieces,\u201d Neth Simon told The Associated Press by phone from Siem Reap province.",
      "She described the statue\u2019s design as displaying carved jewelry and robe and sash, with a unique left-hand gesture across the chest \u2014 \u201can uncommon representation in Khmer (Cambodian) art.\u201d",
      "The statue\u2019s presumed head was discovered at the same temple in 1927 during the French colonial era, and is currently kept at Cambodia\u2019s main National Museum in the capital Phnom Penh. Neth Simon said the torso was found about 50 meters (yards) away from the site where the head was discovered, and that an optical electronic scan confirmed they were a match.",
      "A near-complete reconstruction of the status is possible, Neth Simon added, now that only the right hand of the statue remains missing. Her team will ask the Minister of Culture and Fine Art for approval to reattach the head and body of the sculpture to make it whole for public display.",
      "The Angkor site sprawls across some 400 square kilometers (155 square miles), containing the ruins of capitals of various Cambodian empires from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Scholars consider it to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia.",
      "The site is Cambodia\u2019s most popular tourist attraction and in 2024 attracted about a million international tourists, according to Cambodia\u2019s Tourism Ministry.",
      "The excavations aim to organize and preserve the numerous art objects scattered throughout the Ta Prohm complex, highlighting the ongoing efforts to protect and understand Cambodia\u2019s rich cultural heritage, the Apsara Authority says.",
      "Neth Simon said she would be delighted if the statue\u2019s pieces could be reassembled after being far apart from each other for a century.",
      "\u201cAs an archaeologist, I would be really happy,\" she said."

      "JOHANNESBURG -- Lawmakers in South Africa laid out plans to shore up the budgets for health and defense but also put up value added tax by 0.5%, a move that will raise the cost of living as consumers pay more for goods, including food, and services.",
      "An additional 28.9 billion rand ($1.5 billion) was earmarked for health spending in the 2025 budget, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said, as the country scrambles to make up for cuts to aid from the U.S. under the Trump administration.",

The collision sparked explosions and fires that burned for 24 hours. Footage filmed from a helicopter on Tuesday morning showed the fire appeared to be out on the tanker, which had a large gash on its port side.",

      "The Bosnian Prosecutor\u2019s Office issued the order after Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik, Prime Minister Radovan Viskovic and Parliament Speaker Nenad Stevandic failed to answer two summons for questioning.",
      "The three are suspected of violating Bosnia\u2019s constitutional order with their policies, Bosnian media reported.",
      "Last month Bosnian Serb lawmakers passed a set of disputed laws that barred the central Bosnian state judiciary and police from operating in the Serb-controlled part of the country, called Republika Srpska.",
      "The lawmakers passed the laws after a Bosnian court convicted Dodik of disobeying orders from the top international official in Bosnia. The court sentenced him to a year in prison and banned him from public office.",
      "Dodik has repeatedly said he does not recognize the Bosnian prosecution office and will not go to Sarajevo for questioning. He dismissed the detention order at a press conference on Wednesday as \u201cnon-existent.\u201d",

      "China, Iran and Russia have conducted joint naval drills in the Middle East",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- China, Iran and Russia conducted joint naval drills Tuesday in the Middle East, offering a show of force in a region still uneasy over Tehran's rapidly expanding nuclear program and as Yemen's Houthi rebels threaten new attacks on ships.",
      "The joint drills, called the Maritime Security Belt 2025, took place in the Gulf of Oman near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all crude oil traded worldwide passes. The area around the strait in the past has seen Iran seize commercial ships and launch suspected attacks in the time since President Donald Trump first unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The drill marked the fifth year the three countries took part in the drills.",
      "This year\u2019s drill likely sparked a warning late Monday from the British military\u2019s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which said there was GPS interference in the strait, with disruptions lasting for several hours and forcing crews to rely on backup navigation methods.",
      "\u201cThis was likely GPS jamming to reduce the targeting capability of drones and missiles,\u201d wrote Shaun Robertson, an intelligence analyst at the EOS Risk Group. \u201cHowever, electronic navigation system interference has been reported in this region previously during periods of increased tension and military exercises.\u201d",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry identified the vessels it sent to the drill as the corvettes Rezky and the Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov, as well as the tanker Pechenega. China's Defense Ministry said it sent the guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu. Neither offered a count of the personnel involved.",
      "Neither China nor Russia actively patrol the wider Middle East, whose waterways remain crucial for global energy supplies. Instead they broadly cede that to Western nations largely led by the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Observers for the drill included Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 with the Americans likely keeping watch as well.",
      "However, both China and Russia have deep interests in Iran. For China, it has continued to purchase Iranian crude oil despite facing Western sanctions, likely at a discount compared to global prices. Beijing also remains one of the top markets for Iranian imports.",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has relied on Iran for the supply of bomb-carrying drones it uses in its war on Ukraine.",
      "The drills marked a major moment for Iran's state-run television network. It's aired segments showing live-fire during a night drill and sailors manning deck guns on a vessel. The exercises come after an Iranian monthslong drill that followed a direct Israeli attack on the country, targeting its air defenses and sites associated with its ballistic missile program.",
      "While Tehran sought to downplay the assault, it shook the wider populace and came as a campaign of Israeli assassinations and attacks have decimated Iran's self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d \u2014 a series of militant groups allied with the Islamic Republic. Syrian President Bashar Assad was also overthrown in December, further weakening Iran's grip on the wider region.",
      "All the while, Iran has increasingly stockpiled more uranium enriched at near weapons-grade levels, something only done by atomic-armed nations. Tehran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb.",
      "Iran's nuclear program has drawn warnings from both Israel and the U.S. that it won't allow Tehran to obtain a bomb, signalling military action against the program could happen.

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Several hundred student protesters have blocked Serbia's public television station building in Belgrade as tensions are soaring in the Balkan country days ahead of a planned large rally over the weekend billed as an endgame in months of anti-government demonstrations.",
      "The students first blocked the TV building in central Belgrade, Serbia's capital, late on Monday and several hundred gathered again early on Tuesday, after announcing that their blockade will last for at least 22 hours.",
      "University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people. The protests have rocked populist rule of President Aleksandar Vucic and his firm grip on power.",
      "During the late Monday blockade, riot police briefly intervened with batons against the crowd, which tried to block one of the entrances to the TV building with metal security fences. At least one plain clothes policemen was injured in skirmishes.",
      "The students blame the public TV for bias reporting and siding with Vucic and the government during the demonstrations. The Serbian president was the guest of the main TV news bulletin on Monday evening, but its yet unclear what exactly triggered the evening protest.",
      "During the interview, Vucic insulted the student-led protests, warning that security forces will use force against participants of the big rally planned for Saturday. He pledged never to step down because of the massive nationwide demonstrations.",
      "\u201cYou will have to kill me if you want to replace me,\u201d he said,",
      "The TV reporter who interviewed Vucic called the protesting students \u201ca mob,\" which the president appeared to approve of. The station, RTS, issued a statement, denouncing the blockade.",
      "\u201cForcibly preventing RTS employees from coming to their workplaces represents a dangerous step into open conflicts with unpredictable consequences,\u201d it said.",
      "Some of the TV station's employees apparently managed to enter the building through a side entrance that's not publicly known, allowing the program to continue uninterrupted.",
      "Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell down because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. The students have insisted on full accountability in the tragedy, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions.",
      "Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia, which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.",
      "The next big rally is planned on Saturday in Belgrade and Vucic has alleged the protesters \u201cwill try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end.\u201d Many demonstrators \"will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts,\u201d he added.",
      "All student-led protests in the past months have mostly been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.",
      "Vucic and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for over a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union entry for Serbia.",
      "Authorities have indicted 16 people over the canopy collapse, but many doubt that the actual culprits will face justice."

      "BEIRUT -- The Haydar family huddled in their apartment while gunmen stalked their hometown of Baniyas, hunting for members of Syria\u2019s minority Alawite sect like them. After 24 terrifying hours, a friend helped Samir Haydar, his wife and two sons escape \u2014 just in time.",
      "Minutes later, the gunmen, who were Sunni Muslim, broke into his building and killed the Alawites still there, Haydar said. Down the street, gunmen took Haydar\u2019s two older brothers and a nephew out of their homes and killed them, too.",
      "\u201cIf I had stayed five minutes longer, I with my entire family would have been killed,\u201d Haydar, 67, said.",
      "This past weekend\u2019s sectarian violence was possibly among the bloodiest 72 hours in the modern history of a country torn by 14 years of civil war \u2014 and it threatens to open an endless cycle of vengeance. From early Friday to Sunday night, attackers rampaged through coastal provinces heavily populated by Alawites, as well as the nearby provinces of Hama and Homs, killing people, sometimes entire families, on streets, in homes, on rooftops.",
      "Of the nearly 1,000 civilians killed, nearly 200 were in Baniyas, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor. The toll could not be independently confirmed.",
      "Among the attackers, witnesses say, were hardline Sunni Islamists, including Syria-based jihadi foreign fighters, who came from nearby provinces. Some had been allied to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the disbanded insurgent group that in December led the overthrow of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad and whose members dominate the interim government now running the country.",
      "But many were local Sunnis, unleashing hatreds pent-up over past atrocities blamed on Alawites loyal to Assad.",
      "Survivors say some of the attackers in Baniyas were Syrians from surrounding villages seeking vengeance over a 2013 massacre in the nearby town of Beyda, where paramilitaries killed several hundred Sunnis. It was one of several mass killings under then-President Assad, whose attempts to crush protests helped foment an armed insurgency.",
      "Assad, who is Alawite, filled his security agencies and paramilitaries with members of the sect. Some Sunnis blame the entire community for Assad\u2019s brutal crackdowns, though Alawites say they also suffered under his rule.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of injustices. Many were waiting for the chance to let it out,\u201d Haydar said from his hiding place after fleeing home. \u201cInstead of the pain teaching them mercy and making them against killings, they translated it into more killings.\u201d",
      "Government reinforcements \u2014 which residents said did not intervene during the height of the killings \u2014 were eventually sent to restore order, and calm appeared to hold by late Monday. The government declared an independent committee appointed by the president will investigate the attacks. But the bloodshed has deeply tainted attempts by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa to convince Syria\u2019s minorities that he wants to include them as equals.",
      "The bloodshed began after reports Thursday night of seemingly coordinated attacks by Assad loyalists on government security forces near the city of Latakia and elsewhere along the coast.",
      "The Associated Press spoke to nine residents from villages and towns hit by the violence. Some refused to give their names out of fear for their security.",
      "Haydar said that around daybreak Friday, hordes of armed Sunnis descended on Baniyas and surrounding villages in vans and pickup trucks, and waving guns. Another resident said she heard the gunmen shouting, \u201cGod is great,\u201d and threatening and cursing the Alawite residents.",
      "Images and videos soon surfaced online, mostly posted by the perpetrators. Some show fighters in military fatigues pushing residents out of homes into the streets, beating some with rifles and forcing them to bark like dogs, in humiliation. Some show fighters firing on civilians. The hundreds of videos posted could not be immediately verified.",
      "Looting and theft were rampant. Haydar said armed men went into the building of one of his elder brothers, 74-year-old Rafik, stole his valuables and left.",
      "Hiding in his home, Haydar said he saw fighters shoot a neighbor at the entrance of a nearby building. One fighter turned the body over to ensure he was dead.",
      "Around noon Friday, Haydar got a call from the wife of his other brother, Iskander. She screamed that fighters had stormed their building and taken away Iskander and their son, Mourad.",
      "Later, Mourad told his mother what happened. The fighters dragged them to the roof and made him, his father and five other men lie down. Then they sprayed them with bullets. Miraculously, Mourad was uninjured. His father and the rest of the men were killed.",
      "Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of the same neighborhood, said five of his neighbors were shot in the street, including two doctors and their two children. The gunmen prevented anyone from coming to remove their bodies for hours. Acting fast, Sheha secured a van. He, his wife, three children and other families squeezed in and fled.",
      "That night, the village where they took refuge also came under attack. Sheha said he and hundreds of others fled again, sleeping for two nights outside among olive and pine trees.",
      "By Saturday afternoon, Sheha said he knew of at least 20 people killed, including three cousins and two of their children with special needs, gunned down in their food stall.",
      "When fighters entered his nephew\u2019s house, they asked if his wife was Sunni, because she wore a headscarf. They checked her ID and let her go. His sister, living in a building with many Christians, said the gunmen spared them and her husband, in his 80s.",
      "Haydar and his family escaped with help from a Sunni friend who negotiated for hours with the gunmen, explaining that Haydar had once been imprisoned by Assad\u2019s security forces.",
      "The friend, declining to give his name for fear of retribution, said that at one point, the gunmen shoved and hit him, criticizing him for harboring Alawites.",
      "During the weekend\u2019s violence, the friend sheltered 15 Alawites in his home, he said by phone from Baniyas.",
      "In Tuwaym, an Alawite village in the Sunni-majority Hama province in central Syria, a resident said gunmen summoned the men, beat them with rifles and shot some. By the time they left, they had killed 25 members of her family, including her father and nine children between the ages of four and 15.",
      "\u201cI carried the children with my own hands. Some had their bones coming out of the gaping wounds,\u201d she said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear for her safety.",
      "In Baniyas and elsewhere, bodies were left lying in streets, cars and apartment buildings, civil rescue teams said. Sheha and other residents began documenting those killed. Lists of names and recorded testimonies of terrified residents surfaced online. Haydar buried his brothers Sunday.",
      "Sheha was part of a group of Alawite civilians that sought to build bridges with the new government.",
      "He said the Alawites can\u2019t be blamed for the crimes of Assad\u2019s forces. Most Alawites were impoverished under Assad, abused by his top aides and forced to show loyalty and serve in the army, he said.",
      "Instead of seeing inclusion and transitional justice, the community is targeted in revenge, he said. In a national dialogue convened this month by al-Sharaa, only a few Alawites were included in the 600-member conference, he said.",
      "\u201cRecovery from this won\u2019t be easy,\u201d he said.",

      "Hungary\u2019s government is limiting the profit margin for grocers on a number of basic food items in response to growing inflation hitting consumers in the Central European country",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Hungary's government will limit the profit margin for grocers on a number of basic food items, the prime minister said on Tuesday, a response to growing inflation hitting consumers in the Central European country.",
      "Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said in a video on social media that commercial grocers must limit their markup to no more than 10% of wholesale price on 30 different food items, a policy that would be in effect from mid-March until the end of May, but could be extended.",
      "He said that the government would monitor grocers' compliance with the policy, but didn't specify which foods would be included in the requirement.",
      "\"In order to curb excessive and unjustified price increases, we have been negotiating with representatives of commercial chains in recent days,\" Orb\u00e1n said. \u201cUnfortunately, the vendors' offers fell far short of our expectations.\u201d",
      "Inflation data released Tuesday by Hungary's statistical office showed an annual inflation rate of 5.6% for February, while food prices were up 7.1% on the year. By contrast, average inflation in the 20-member eurozone was 2.4% in February, according to the European Union's statistical office Eurostat.",
      "Hungary, which isn\u2019t a member of the eurozone, uses the forint as its national currency.",
      "The data came as an \u201cunpleasant inflation surprise\" for Hungary, which \u201cindicates increasing price pressure in the Hungarian economy with regard to more permanent inflationary trends,\u201d Orsolya Nyeste, a macroeconomic analyst with Erste Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday.",
      "Hungary has frequently led the EU in inflation in recent years as a cost of living crisis has gripped the country. The populist government has pointed to external factors such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia to explain the yearslong inflation spiral, though prices in other regional countries like Poland, Romania and Slovakia haven't risen nearly as steeply.",
      "Extreme jumps in food prices \u2014 peaking at more than 45% at the beginning of 2023 \u2014 have spurred previous government interventions in Hungary that included price caps on a number of food items as well as fuel at filling stations. But some critics and economists argued that sellers simply raised prices on other products to make up for shortfalls caused by the price controls.",
      "The inflation numbers present a challenge for Orb\u00e1n as Hungary's economy continues to struggle before a national election in 2026. The EU's longest-serving leader, in power since 2010, faces a challenge from a new party that has placed the stagnating economy and cost of living issues at the center of its political platform.",
      "Compounding Hungary's difficulties, the EU has withheld billions in funding from Budapest because of concerns over judicial independence and rule-of-law standards."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's international airport Tuesday on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.",
      "Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the massive killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement.",
      "The Manila office of the International Police received an official copy of the arrest warrant from the global court and the notice for an arrest warrant was served to the former president, the government said.",
      "It was not immediately clear where Duterte was taken by the police. The government said the 79-year-old former leader was in good health and was examined by government doctors.",
      "\u201cHe's now in the custody of authorities,\u201d the government said.",
      "The ICC began investigating drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court\u2019s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration\u2019s objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.",

      "The Social Democrats are hoping that economic growth estimated at 1.9% last year, compared with the EU\u2019s 0.8% average, and a jobless rate of 6.4%, roughly the EU average, will keep their support firm.",
      "The next general election in Portugal was scheduled for January 2028."

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Uganda has deployed an unknown number of troops to South Sudan in a bid to protect the fragile government of President Salva Kiir as a tense rivalry with his deputy threatens a return to civil war in the east African nation.",
      "Ugandan special forces have been deployed to Juba, the South Sudanese capital, \u201cto support the government of South Sudan\" against a possible rebel advance on the city, said Maj. Gen. Felix Kulayigye, a spokesperson for the Ugandan military.",
      "\u201cWe sent a force there two days ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not there for peacekeeping.\"",
      "In deploying Ugandan soldiers to Juba, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni moved as a guarantor of the peace process that keeps Kiir and Machar together in a delicate government of national unity, Kulayigye told The Associated Press Tuesday.",
      "Kiir and Museveni are allies, and Museveni has in the past intervened in the South Sudan conflict to keep Kiir in power.",
      "The deployment of Ugandan troops to South Sudan underscores rising tensions in the oil-producing country that has been plagued by political instability and violence since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011.",
      "The U.S. on Sunday ordered nonemergency government personnel to leave Juba. The U.N. is warning of \u201can alarming regression that could erase years of hard-won progress\u201d in South Sudan.",
      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country's north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, that's widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Last week a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, was shot at. Earlier in the week, after the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir, government troops surrounded Machar\u2019s home in Juba and several of his allies were arrested. Deputy army chief Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam, who is seen as loyal to Machar, was among those detained.",
      "Kiir had angered Machar\u2019s group earlier in the year by firing officials seen as loyal to Machar, who has charged that \u201cpersistent violations through unilateral decisions and decrees threaten the very existence\u201d of their peace pact.",
      "Kiir urged calm after last week's helicopter incident, saying in a statement that his government \"will handle this crisis and we will remain steadfast in the path of peace.\u201d",
      "Civil war erupted in South Sudan in late 2013 when a rift between Kiir and Machar escalated into fighting along ethnic lines. Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, accused a group of soldiers loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer, of trying to take power by force.",
      "Machar escaped Juba, and later rebels loyal to him came close to capturing Juba but were repulsed by a combined force of South Sudanese soldiers loyal to Kiir and Ugandan special forces.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the 5-year civil war that followed.",
      "With the support of regional leaders and the international community, Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in 2018 and Machar returned to Juba as South Sudan's first vice president.",
      "But the political rivalry between South Sudan's top two leaders \u2014 with Kiir suspicious of his deputy\u2019s ambitions and Machar calling Kiir a dictator \u2014 remains an obstacle to lasting peace. Both men have been accused of violating multiple ceasefires.",
      "Kiir and Machar are under pressure from the U.S. and others to more quickly implement the 2018 peace deal and prepare for elections.",
      "Challenges include the government\u2019s failure to implement promised reforms such as completing the unification of the army command.",

      "Ukraine has key questions it wants answered as army chiefs from over 30 countries meet in Paris for talks on creating an international force to deter future Russian aggression once a ceasefire is established",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine has key questions it wants answered as army chiefs from over 30 countries arrive Tuesday in Paris for talks on creating an international force to deter future Russian aggression once a ceasefire is established. They include troop size, location and, crucially, military options in the event of a transgression.",
      "The Paris meeting is the most significant culmination so far of French and British efforts to rally nations under a so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d to safeguard Ukraine by establishing a reassurance and deterrence force to dissuade Russia from invading again.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, who is to attend the meeting, said it would be held in \u201cclose coordination\u201d with the NATO alliance.",
      "The talks will include nearly all 32 NATO countries \u2014 notably without the United States \u2014 as well as Commonwealth nations and Asian powers Japan and South Korea, said a French military official. Participants will be invited to spell out what their militaries might be able and willing to contribute, be that troops, weapons or other assistance.",
      "French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said \u201cthis meeting is important because it lays the ground for these security guarantees\u201d and how \u201cEuropean armed forces can gain credit and credibility for diplomatic talks which will, unquestionably, extend over the long term.\u201d",
      "Some Ukrainian officials are wary of any deal without clearly identified security guarantees. For them, a key question is how such a coalition will respond if Russia violates any future ceasefire agreement. What kind of military response would follow a large-scale offensive by Russia and how quickly will that response materialize?",
      "Western and Ukrainian officials said that, while there is plenty of thinking and resolve, there is no definitive plan for military options yet. First, they must assess what willing countries might be able to offer. The Associated Press spoke to Western and Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, as well as French officials in Paris and British officials in London. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to speak openly about sensitive matters.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the proposal but expressed skepticism, telling The AP in an interview in February that foreign troops alone would not be a sufficient guarantee of security for his country, and that such a plan should be backed up by weapons from the U.S. and Europe, and support for Kyiv to develop its own defense industry.",
      "\u201cDiplomats are discussing, military officials are discussing, but we still don\u2019t have real proposals,\u201d said a senior Ukrainian official about the plan. The talks \u201care not in the first stage, we did a lot in the first stage, but we still don\u2019t have a real solid approach.\u201d",
      "As President Donald Trump has appeared to nix the idea of U.S. security guarantees and other U.S. officials said this will fall on Europe to enforce, the French-British plan looks to create a force equipped with enough military might to dissuade Russia from attacking Ukraine again. \u201cThat is the crux of it,\u201d said a Western official in Kyiv.",
      "The force being envisaged by France and Britain would aim to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any ceasefire, a French military official told AP. It could include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine\u2019s defense in the event of a Russian attack that shatters any truce, the official said.",
      "The Western official in Kyiv, offering another idea on the table, said they could incorporate direct and immediate strikes on Russian assets in the event of a violation.",
      "Details of the contours of the proposal have emerged piecemeal in recent weeks as technical discussions have been ongoing between Western diplomatic and military officials in Ukraine and other European capitals.",
      "Political leaders have convened key summits in the past two months to establish common ground. It was discussed at a summit of more than a dozen mostly European leaders in London on March 2, and at a virtual planning meeting on March 5 called by the U.K. and attended by officials from about 20 countries.",
      "France and Britain are now casting the net even wider in their search for nations willing to back the blueprint and provide the force with teeth. The Paris talks on Tuesday will include not just NATO and European Union nations but also Asian and Oceania countries. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea will dial into the discussions remotely, the French military official said. Turkey, which has the largest army in NATO and a robust defense industry and shared stakes in the Black Sea, will attend. NATO nation Canada will also be represented.",
      "The United States \u2014 NATO\u2019s most militarily powerful member \u2014 was not invited because European nations want to show that they are able to shoulder a large part of the job of safeguarding Ukraine once a truce is in effect, the French military official said.",
      "Last month, some Western officials described a small Europe-dominated \u201creassurance force\u201d of less than 30,000 troops, rather than an ambitious army of peacekeepers posted along the 600-mile (1,000 kilometer) front line.",
      "But other officials have said the numbers were under discussion. According to one version of the proposal, troops would be posted away from the front line at key infrastructure sites such as nuclear power plants and backed by Western air and sea power. The front line would largely be monitored remotely, with drones and other technology. Air power, including U.S. air power based outside Ukraine, perhaps in Poland or Romania, would be in reserve to deter breaches and reopen Ukrainian airspace to commercial flights.",
      "Allied navies could also play a role in the Black Sea clearing mines and patrolling to keep international waters safe.",
      "The idea is to \u201caggregate\u201d the capabilities those countries are ready to provide in order to be able to offer security guarantees to make sure the peace deal is \u201crobust and verifiable,\u201d with the aim to get some U.S. backstop, another French official said.",
      "\u201cTo get signals on the U.S. backstop, the \u2018able and willing\u2019 European countries must be able to aggregate their capabilities and demands,\u201d he said.",
      "Some Western officials cautioned that there will be several stages to a peace plan and a broader range of countries could join the coalition later on. The first step could be a one-month freeze, as proposed by Zelenskyy and European leaders, as a confidence building measure.",
      "The Ukrainian officials said they were optimistic about the coalition of the willing, conceding they have few other options with NATO off the table.",
      "\u201cI fully believe it\u2019s very possible,\u201d said one senior Ukrainian official. \u201cTrump is comfortable with the idea, the idea is very positive for us, and if Europe wants to be a real player, they should do this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they lose this opportunity, we will be in a very difficult situation,\u201d he added.",

      "The measure is temporary and intended to ensure that those migrants who are already in the country can be better integrated, Chancellor Christian Stocker from the conservative Austrian People\u2019s Party said.",
      "\u201cAustria\u2019s capacities are limited, and that is why we have decided to prevent further overloading,\u201d Stocker said.",

      "The new three-party coalition made up of the People\u2019s Party, the center-left Social Democrats and the liberal Neos, has said that curbing migration is one of its top issues and vowed to implement strict new asylum rules.",

      "Stocker said the measure was necessary because \u201cthe quality of the school system, integration and ultimately the security of our entire systems need to be protected \u2014 so that we do not impair their ability to function.\u201d",

The clamp-down on migrants is a harsh turnaround from ten years ago, when countries like Germany and Sweden openly welcomed more than 1 million migrants from war-torn countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.",
      "Many communities and towns in other countries, such as Germany, also say they no longer have capacities to find shelter or homes for migrants.",
      "The EU is trying to keep more migrants from entering its 27-country bloc and move faster to deport those whose asylum procedures are rejected.",

      "Pope Francis has written and spoken at length about sickness, aging and death",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis has written and spoken at length about sickness, aging and death, and personally directed that his doctors provide the fairly detailed daily updates that have punctuated his own battle with pneumonia.",
      "On Monday, they reported good news: Francis was no longer in imminent danger of death but needed to remain hospitalized for several more days to receive treatment.",
      "The 88-year-old pope is merely responding to the sometimes morbid interest in the health of popes over centuries, and is making his own the somewhat-mixed legacy of St. John Paul II. The Polish pope suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease, and his decline was on public view for years. But the Vatican never admitted he had the disease until after he was dead.",
      "Francis\u2019 candor with his own fragility is very much in keeping with a decision he made early on in his papacy to be up front about his health: He granted an unprecedented tell-all interview to an Argentine doctor who published a book in 2021 detailing Francis\u2019 physical and mental health history. And last week, Francis recorded an audio message from the hospital that laid bare the weakness of his voice, and the labored, breathless effort it took for him to utter just a few words.",
      "Here are a few of Francis\u2019 past musings on sickness, ageing and death and how they might affect the future of his pontificate.",
      "Francis has long complained about the way society treats old people, saying they are part of today\u2019s consumerist \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d when they are deemed no longer productive. For that reason especially, he insisted that Pope Benedict XVI continue to be part of the life of the church during his 10-year retirement.",
      "Francis\u2019 views on ageing have been consistent, even as he himself has aged and become dependent on a wheelchair and walker to get around.",
      "In the 2010 book \u201cOn Heaven and Earth,\u201d written alongside his friend the Argentine Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Francis denounced the cruelty that confronts elderly people. He shamed families who shut their grandparents away in nursing homes and neglect to visit them.",
      "\u201cThe elderly are sources of the transmission of history, the people who give us memories, they are the memory of the people, of a nation, of the family and of the culture, religion,\u201d said Francis, who at the time was the archbishop of Buenos Aires.",
      "In the same book, then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio recalled that his grandmother Rosa, who helped raise him, had the words of an adage framed on her bedside table that stayed with him all his life: \u201cSee that God sees you, see that he is watching you, see that you will die and you don\u2019t know when.\u201d",
      "He referred to the saying again in 2018 in a speech to priests, and that his grandmother had instructed him to recite it every day \u201c\u2018so you will remember that life has an end.\u2019\"",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t understand much at the time, but that verse, since I was three years old, has stuck with me,\u201d he told the priests. \u201cAnd it helped me. The thing was kind of bleak, but it helped me.\u201d",
      "The Argentine journalist and physician, Dr. Nelson Castro, revealed in his 2021 book \u201cThe Health of Popes,\u201d that Francis had reached out to him within a few months of his 2013 election with a suggestion that he write a book about the history of the health of the popes, including his own.",
      "Castro was granted access to the Vatican Secret Archives to research the lives and deaths of past popes and had a sit-down interview with Francis on Feb. 19, 2019, during which the reigning pope spoke at length and in detail about his various ailments over the years: The respiratory infection that resulted in the removal of the upper lobe of his right lung, the gangrenous gallbladder he had removed when he was provincial superior of the Jesuits, the compressed vertebrae, flat feet and fatty liver he has lived with.",
      "The most noteworthy revelation was that Francis said he saw a psychiatrist weekly during six months of Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship. He had sought out help to manage his anxiety when he was trying to hide people from the military and ferry them out of Argentina.",
      "\u201cIn those six months she helped me with respect to how to manage the fears of that time,\u201d he told Castro. \u201cIf you can imagine what it was like to transport someone hidden in the car \u2014 covered by a blanket \u2014 and pass through military controls. \u2026 It created an enormous tension in me.\u201d",
      "He said the therapy also helped him to maintain a sense of equilibrium in making decisions of all kinds, and that in general he believes all priests must understand human psychology.",
      "\u201cWe should offer a mate to our neuroses,\u201d he said, referring to the South American tea. \u201cThey are our companions for life.\u201d",
      "As early as 2014 Francis was already assuming his papacy would be short-lived and that his own death was not far off.",
      "\u201cI realize that this is not going to last long, two or three years, and then \u2026 off to the house of the Father,\u201d he told reporters in 2014 while traveling home from one of his early foreign trips, to South Korea.",
      "He told Castro later that he thought about death \u2014 a lot \u2014 but that it didn\u2019t scare him \u201cone bit.\u201d",
      "Francis made plans, too: He decided his tomb will be in St. Mary Major basilica, not in the Vatican, so he can be near his favorite icon of the Madonna, the Salus Populi Romani (\"Salvation of the People of Rome\"), which is located there.",
      "More recently, he has taken to speaking about upcoming events that he is pretty sure he won\u2019t be around for, and indicating who might.",
      "In 2023, speaking to reporters about the Vatican\u2019s warming relations with Vietnam, Francis concurred that the country warranted a papal visit.",
      "\u201cIf I don\u2019t go, surely John XXIV will,\u201d he said chuckling, referring to a future pope who might be named for the progressive, Vatican II-era pontiff, John XXIII.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum are unjustified, but his government will not retaliate with its own tariffs",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Wednesday that U.S. tariffs on Australian steel and aluminum were unjustified, but his government would not retaliate with its own tariffs.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.",
      "A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.",
      "Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.",
      "\u201cIt has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",
      "Trump described Turnbull, who quit politics in 2018 after being overthrown as prime minister by his own government, as a weak and ineffective leader.",
      "\u201cMalcolm Turnbull, the former Prime Minister of Australia who was always leading that wonderful country from 'behind', never understood what was going on in China, nor did he have the capacity to do so,\u201d Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

    "story": [
      "Philippine ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, who left a savage legacy over his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, was arrested on an international warrant as he returned to Manila",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, who left a savage legacy over his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, was arrested on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity for the thousands killed in a war he waged against drugs in a political career spanning decades. His detention capped an international investigation into killings, which unfolded for more than a dozen years..",
      "Duterte again came under the spotlight during a weekend trip to Hong Kong when the trip sparked speculation that he may have gone into exile while on a trip to Hong Kong to evade a looming international arrest warrant. He had appeared as the main speaker on Sunday at a gathering of thousands of cheering and flag-waving Filipino expatriates, who jammed Southorn Stadium in downtown Wan Chai district.",
      "Now 79 and in poor health, Duterte campaigned for his political party\u2019s senatorial candidates ahead of the May 12 mid-term elections in the Philippines. He said he was aware the International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for his arrest over his campaign against illegal drugs that left thousands of suspects dead.",
      "He again tried to justify the brutal crackdown and the crowd cheered him on. Police arrested him as he got off the plane at Manilla International Airport based on an ICC warrant.",
      "Here\u2019s more about Duterte, his ICC case and what lies ahead for one of Asia\u2019s most unorthodox leaders in his time:",
      "Duterte, a former prosecutor, congressman and longtime mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao, built a political name with his expletive-laced outbursts against the elites, the dominant Roman Catholic church and the West. He was also seen as pro-poor and a populist, but he is perhaps best remembered for his brutal approach to criminality, particularly illegal drugs.",
      "Under his police-enforced crackdown in Davao at the start of the millennium, an estimated 1,000 mostly poor suspects were gunned down extrajudicially. One police officer involved in the Davao killings who later defected from Duterte told The Associated Press that up to 10,000 suspects were killed by his and other police and civilian hit squads under Duterte.",
      "The death toll in the crackdown was alarmingly high for years, gaining Duterte nicknames like \u201cthe Punisher\u201d and \u201cDuterte Harry,\u201d after the Western movie police character with little regard for the law.",
      "Human rights activists said people were afraid to testify against Duterte in court.",
      "In 2016, Duterte won the presidency on an audacious but failed promise to eradicate illegal drugs and corruption within three to six months, in a country long weary of crime and corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cAll of you who are into drugs, you sons of bitches, I will really kill you,\u201d Duterte told a huge crowd in a 2016 campaign stop in Manila. \u201cI have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.\u201d",
      "The United States, the European Union and other Western governments raised alarms over the anti-drugs campaign, prompting Duterte in 2016 to tell then-President Barack Obama \u201cyou can go to hell\u201d as he threatened to \u201cbreak up with America.\u201d",
      "The ICC launched an investigation into drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability over the killings.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court\u2019s investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn\u2019t have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in July 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration\u2019s objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.",
      "China, which controls Hong Kong, and the Philippines do not currently belong to the ICC, but both are members of Interpol. The global court may issue a warrant for Duterte\u2019s arrest through Interpol.",
      "A prominent Philippine politician closely involved in the ICC cases against Duterte told the AP over the weekend the global court had issued a warrant for Duterte's arrest through Interpol. The politician spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive issue publicly.",
      "Neither the ICC nor Interpol have yet confirmed the issuance of an arrest warrant.",
      "In his rambling speech on Sunday before mostly Filipino workers in Hong Kong, Duterte again justified his deadly anti-drugs campaign, saying it safeguarded Filipino people.",
      "Duterte has denied authorizing extrajudicial killings, but he openly and repeatedly threatened to kill suspected drug dealers when he was in office.",
      "\u201cWhat was my sin?\u201d Duterte asked in Hong Kong. \u201cI did everything in my time so Filipinos can have a little peace and tranquility.\u201d",
      "He said he was prepared to go to jail but told the crowd in jest to make donations for the construction of a monument of him \u2014 which he suggested with a gesture of his hand should show him holding a gun.",
      "Duterte had said he retired from politics after his stormy presidential term ended in 2022. But in another turnaround from his earlier remarks, he registered to run for mayor of Davao with one of his sons running with him for vice mayor in elections in May.",
      "In Davao, additional police forces were deployed at the international airport and extra checkpoints were set up in what authorities said were meant to be prepared for any contingency ahead of the mid-term elections. The forces in Davao and elsewhere could step in if Duterte\u2019s arrest were to ignite unrest, which the Marcos administration said it could deftly handle."

      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate its businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s trade minister said this week that he has failed to win assurances from U.S. officials that the key U.S. ally will be exempt from tariffs, some of which take effect on Wednesday.",
      "Yoji Muto was in Washington for last ditch negotiations over the tariffs on a range of Japanese exports including cars, steel and aluminum.",
      "Muto said Monday in Washington that Japan, which contributes to the U.S. economy by heavily investing and creating jobs in the United States, \u201cshould not be subject to\u201d 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and auto exports to America.",
      "His meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett came just two days before the steel and aluminum tariffs are due to take effect. President Donald Trump has also said a possible 25% tariff on imported foreign autos could take effect in early April.",
      "Muto said the U.S. officials acknowledged Japanese contributions and agreed to continue talks, but did not approve his request for Japan's exemption from the steep import duties.",
      "\u201cWe did not receive a response that Japan will be exempt,\u201d Muto told reporters. \u201cWe must continue to assert our position.\u201d",
      "As Trump's tariff threats have triggered tensions and vows of retaliation from Canada, Mexico and China, Japan has been working to firm up ties with other countries.",
      "Last week, the foreign and trade ministers from Japan and Britain gathered in Tokyo for their first \u201ctwo-plus-two\u201d economic dialogue. They agreed to stand up for \u201cfair, rules-based international trade,\u201d though nobody directly mentioned Trump.",
      "Japan depends heavily on exports and the auto tariffs would hurt, because vehicles are its biggest export and the United States is their top destination.",
      "\u201cClearly companies in Japan are very concerned,\u201d said Rintaro Nishimura, political analyst and associate at Japan Practice of The Asia Group. \u201cObviously the auto is the crown jewel for Japan, especially in the context of these tariffs.\" He says they are concerned also because the Trump administration is carrying it out in just two months after taking office.",
      "Trump also has criticized Japan\u2019s contributions to the two countries\u2019 mutual defense arrangements, adding to tensions with Tokyo.",
      "Muto said the two sides agreed to keep discussing to find ways to establish a \u201cwin-win\u201d relationship that would serve national interests of both countries.",
      "The two sides also discussed energy cooperation, including joint development of liquefied natural gas reserves in Alaska, which Trump and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba agreed on during Ishiba's visit to the White House in February.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump said last month he was considering a tariff exemption for Australia, a free trade treaty partner that has traded with the United States at a deficit for decades.",
      "A former Australian government secured an exemption with the previous Trump administration in 2018 based on arguments including that Australian steelmaker BlueScope employs thousands of workers in the U.S.",
      "Albanese said he would continue to pursue an Australian exemption. The 2018 exemption took several months to secure.",
      "\u201cIt has been foreshadowed that no country regardless of its relationship with the United States has been granted an exemption. Such a decision by the Trump administration is entirely unjustified,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cTariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers. This is why Australia will not be imposing reciprocal tariffs on the United States,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "The U.S. officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. decision not to exempt Australia was announced days after a spat became public between Trump and the former Australian prime minister who secured the 2018 exemption, Malcolm Turnbull.",

      "\u201cI always thought he was a weak and ineffective leader and, obviously, Australian\u2019s (sic) agreed with me!!!\u201d Trump added.",
      "Trump was responding to an interview Turnbull gave this week to U.S. media company Bloomberg in which the former Australian leader said Chinese President Xi Jinping would take advantage of the U.S. president's chaotic and erratic leadership.",
      "\u201cI think China will take advantage, massive advantage of Trump,\u201d Turnbull told Bloomberg.",
      "\u201cWhat my prediction will be that President Xi will aim to be the exact opposite of Trump. Where Trump is chaotic, he will be consistent. Where Trump is rude and abusive, he\u2019ll be respectful. Where Trump is erratic, he will be consistent,\u201d Turnbull said.",
      "\u201cAnd what that will do is build trust with countries, and there\u2019ll be many countries who will, you know, looking at China on the one hand and Trump on the other, will find China a more attractive partner,\u201d Turnbull added."

      "The world\u2019s biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense trans-Atlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",

EU officials have made clear that the tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 are aimed at products made in Republican-held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia. Yet the tariffs will also hit blue states such as Illinois, the No. 1 U.S. producer of soybeans, which is also on the list.",

First on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls \u201crebalancing measures,\u201d which the EU had from 2018 and 2020, but which were suspended under the Biden administration. Then on April 13 come the additional duties targeting 18 billion euros ($19.6 billion) in U.S. exports to the bloc.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. corruption case involving Indian energy tycoon Gautam Adani has exposed vulnerabilities in India's solar sector that are hindering its capacity to switch to clean energy and help limit climate change",
      "BENGALURU, India -- President Donald Trump's decision to freeze a law banning business bribes overseas could offer Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, one of Asia's richest people, a reprieve from American corruption allegations linked to a major solar project in India.",
      "U.S. prosecutors allege that one of Adani's companies duped investors by hiding that its project was backed by a $265 million bribery scheme. The case now may be reviewed, and enforcement of any potential decision against it is uncertain. Whatever its fate, the case has highlighted vulnerabilities in India\u2019s solar sector that are hindering its capacity to switch to clean energy, help limit climate change and cut heavy pollution in many of its cities.",
      "The Adani Group, whose business interests span much of the economy from ports and airports to energy and media, has denied the U.S. allegations. It declined requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump suspended the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, raising expectations among some in India that the allegations against Adani might be put on ice. Shares in Adani\u2019s companies surged but then fell just days later when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sought help from Indian authorities in serving its complaint against Adani.",
      "The allegations have had wider repercussions outside India. Adani Green Energy has withdrawn its wind energy projects from Sri Lanka after the island nation sought to renegotiate prices. Kenya canceled energy and airport expansion deals with the company, while investor TotalEnergies, a French oil giant, has paused new investments.",
      "Adani Green Energy, or AGEL, is India\u2019s largest renewable energy company. It is building one of the world\u2019s largest clean power projects in salt deserts bordering Pakistan in the Western Indian state of Gujarat. Once completed, they would produce 30 gigawatts of clean power, enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.",
      "AGEL has projects in 12 Indian states, with 11.6 gigawatts of clean power capacity. It aims to generate 50 gigawatts of renewable power by 2030, a tenth of India\u2019s clean energy goal for the same time period.",
      "In November, Adani said his company would invest $35 billion over five years in large-scale solar, wind, and hybrid power plants across India. It is also one of the country's few large-scale producers of solar and wind power components. But the industry itself is struggling.",
      "India's state-owned electricity companies are chronically short on cash. By 2022-23 their losses totaled $7.8 billion \u2014 2.4% of India\u2019s GDP, according to government data. Operations are plagued by bad planning, fears of public anger over higher electricity rates and large electricity losses during transmission.",
      "\u201cWaiving the costs upfront makes it cheap for those building power plants, but ultimately the system has to bear that cost,\u201d said Rohit Chandra, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi.",
      "Accommodating inevitable fluctuations in solar and wind power is also costly, said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. That means keeping expensive coal power on standby.",
      "Renewable energy is cheaper than coal in India, but utilities still view clean power as just a \u201cstatutory obligation,\u201d said Alexander Hogeveen Rutter, an energy analyst in Bengaluru.",
      "To troubleshoot state utilities' financial woes, the federal government agency established the Solar Energy Corporation of India, or SECI, to help manage risks.",
      "SECI awarded a contract of 12 gigawatts of solar energy to the Adani Group and another New York Stock Exchange-listed company, Azure Power, at a specific price. The U.S. indictment alleges that state utilities balked at buying power at that rate and that the bribery was aimed at getting them to sign on.",
      "Azure Power said in a statement in November that it was cooperating with American agencies and that it had ceased to employ the people mentioned in the indictment. SECI didn't respond to queries from The Associated Press.",
      "SECI doesn\u2019t buy clean power but facilitates sales to Indian states. That cuts risks of power developers going unpaid but it has raised administrative costs, Rutter said. \"This whole scheme, which was supposed to drive down costs is actually driving up costs,\u201d he said.",
      "India restricts imports of cheap Chinese solar modules and is subsidizing local manufacturers. That helped raise domestic production by six-fold in 2021-2023, according to the Press Trust of India, though Indian-made solar components are more expensive than Chinese one.",
      "But India lags behind countries like Brazil and Australia in rooftop solar, having installed only 11 gigawatts so far -\u2013 far less than the 40 gigawatts it aimed to have by 2022. Policies favoring large installations have constrained growth of solar, which mainly comes from football-field-sized farms, Rutter said.",
      "Many large renewable energy companies, like Adani's, manufacture parts like solar panels and cells to help reduce their own costs and remain profitable while selling power at lower prices acceptable to the state-owned utilities, Garg said. But this limits competition since small companies \u2014 considered vital for India's clean energy ambitions \u2014 can't match the prices set by corporate giants that make the equipment used to generate solar power.",
      "The U.S. indictment has exposed weaknesses spots in India\u2019s regulatory framework, which is prone to \u201ccrony relationships\u201d between companies and the government, said Joe Athialy, executive director of the New Delhi-based Centre for Financial Accountability.",
      "Most government bids are conducted transparently, with some even driving down prices to unviable levels, said Vinay Rustagi, an independent energy consultant. But occasional \u201cone-off tenders\u201d are poorly publicized or slip under the radar, limiting competition.",
      "The fraud allegations against Adani reflect \"an extreme example of trying to combine solar project development with solar manufacturing,\u201d he said.",
      "Slower progress for India's transition away from fossil fuels matters. It's the most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people in 2023, and its electricity demand is projected to grow by at least 6% annually for the next few years, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "India's solar capacity has been growing rapidly with record-high solar power installations reported in 2024. But while solar makes up 16% of India's total generating capacity, it accounts for only 4% of the electricity used, according to government data compiled by IEEFA. The global average was over 5% in 2023, according to the London-based think tank Ember.",
      "By late 2024, SECI still didn\u2019t have buyers for 9 gigawatts or more than a third of the 24.5 gigawatts of solar power capacity it can offer.",
      "As is true in many places, insufficient storage capacity means solar projects struggle to find buyers since the utilities prefer to purchase stable, ready-to-use power. This is why only 16% of last year\u2019s new solar projects had found buyers by November, compared to 44% the year before, according to a report by the financial services firm JM Financial Institutional Securities.",
      "\u201cIndia\u2019s solar story, while still growing, is slowing down,\u201d said Chandra.",

      "Cameron Smith, 50, was also ordered Monday to pay more than $2.1 million in restitution, the Bismarck Tribune reported, as well as fines totaling $250,000. He faces deportation after his release.",
      "Smith, who is originally from the Toronto area but had been living in Astoria, Oregon, pleaded guilty last Septembe r to charges of destroying energy facilities for the incidents near Carpenter, South Dakota, in 2022 and in 2023 near Ray, North Dakota.",
      "U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor sentenced Smith to two consecutive 12 \u00bd-year terms, far above federal sentencing guidelines that recommended 3 \u00bd to 4 \u00bc years per count.",
      "Prosecutor David Hagler said the higher sentence was justified because Smith\u2019s actions met the definition of terrorism by \u201cattempting to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Douglas Passon argued against the longer sentence, describing Smith as a \u201chyper-aware individual wanting to create awareness about climate change\u201d who intentionally avoided harming anyone.",
      "In the South Dakota incident, prosecutors said the damage inflicted by Smith caused a shutdown of a pump station on the Keystone XL Pipeline, which led to a leak that damaged neighboring land. Damages to transformers and other infrastructure at a North Dakota power substation caused outages to 243 customers.",
      "Smith told the court his actions were driven by frustration after years of trying to raise awareness of climate change through lawful means. He said he chose remote locations to avoid harming people, and he argued for a lesser sentence, citing his autism and Crohn\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cThis is tantamount to a life sentence, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right,\u201d Smith said. He expressed doubt he would receive adequate medical care while incarcerated.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t survive this,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Traynor was not swayed.",
      "\u201cYou ignored the rule of law in the United States and carried out your actions in a terrorist manner,\u201d Traynor said. \u201cYou did not engage in this conduct on a whim. You committed two separate attacks on critical infrastructure 10 months apart and traveled a great distance to do so.\u201d",
      "Passon told The Associated Press on Tuesday that they will appeal. He said the sentence was unjust given Smith's medical and mental conditions and disproportionate compared with similar crimes."

      "The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay a trial in a case accusing Amazon of using deceptive practices in its Prime subscription program, citing staffing and budgetary challenges at the government agency.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, a lawyer for the FTC, made the request before U.S. District Judge John Chun, who is overseeing the legal proceedings from a 2023 lawsuit the commission filed against the e-commerce giant in Washington state.",
      "\u201cOur resource constraints are severe and really unique to this moment,\u201d Cohen said during a status hearing on Wednesday. \u201cWe have lost employees in the agency, in our division and on the case team.\u201d",

Staff members who resigned for other reasons also have not been replaced due to a government hiring freeze, he said.",
      "The Amazon trial had been scheduled to start in September. The FTC is seeking to relax some of the deadlines in the case and a delay akin to a two-month continuance. The agency does not want to \u201cmove the trial back more than a couple of months,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Currently, the agency's legal team is \u201cracing at considerable cost\u201d to meet a late April deadline for discovery while at the same time dealing with restrictive rules on purchasing court documents and travel, Cohen explained.",
      "Other factors could hamper staffers' preparations for the trial, he said. In April, FTC employees will have to spend time packing up and vacating their office building so they can potentially move to \u201can abandoned USAID facility,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Chun, the judge, asked how \u201cthings are going to be different in two months\u201d with the issues the agency is experiencing.",

      "President Donald Trump says he's buying a Tesla to show loyalty to company CEO Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump, who's buying a Tesla to show loyalty to company CEO Elon Musk, has had plenty to say about electric vehicles over the years. Most of it is not good.",
      "Of course, Trump was once a sharp critic of Musk, too, which is especially notable given how tight the pair are now.",
      "A look at some of Trump's comments on EVs \u2014 and Musk:",
      "Trump marked Christmas 2023 with a social media post lumping \u201cAll Electric Car Lunacy\u201d in with a number of political enemies that he said \u201care looking to destroy our once great USA. MAY THEY ROT IN HELL.\u201d",
      "A few weeks earlier, during a rally in Ankeny, Iowa, Trump said of EVs: \u201cThey don\u2019t go far. They cost a fortune.\u201d He also suggested that the U.S. military was looking at making \u201cArmy tanks all electric\u201d and scoffing, \u201cyou\u2019re in the middle of the desert and you say, \u2018You know what, we\u2019re running low on electric. Do they have a charger around anywhere?\u2019\u201d",
      "In November 2023, at a Claremont, New Hampshire, rally, Trump similarly picked up on distance being an electric vehicle issue: \u201cYou can\u2019t get out of New Hampshire in an electric car.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere are you going? \u2018I\u2019m going to Massachusetts.\u2019 Well, you better get yourself a gas turbine because this car is not going to get you there,\" he said. \u201cWell, you could, if you stop about four times.\u201d",
      "That followed his joke during an event in Clive, Iowa, the previous month: \"Electric cars are good if you have a towing company.\"",
      "Electric vehicles were an especially attractive Trump target during the six-week United Auto Workers strike in September 2023. That's when he told a rally in Clinton Township, Michigan, \u201cYou go all electric so you can drive for 15 minutes before you have to get a charge.\u201d",
      "Trump, a Republican, also posted on his social media site that then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, sold autoworkers \"down the river with his ridiculous all Electric Car Hoax.\" He suggested that promoting electric vehicles \u201cwas the idea of the Radical Left Fascists, Marxists, & Communists\" and that \"Within 3 years, all of these cars will be made in China.\u201d",
      "As on many top issues, Trump has been inconsistent on electric vehicles. During his first term, in September 2020, Trump cheered an all-electric Lordstown Motors Endurance truck at an event outside the White House, calling it an \u201cincredible vehicle.\u201d",
      "After Musk endorsed the former president's bid to return to the White House, Trump began suggesting that electric vehicles could work for some buyers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for electric cars. I have to be because Elon endorsed me very strongly,\" Trump said during an August rally in Atlanta.",
      "In a subsequent conversation on X, the social media platform Musk also owns, Trump called Tesla a \u201cgreat product\u201d while noting, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean everybody should have an electric car.\u201d",
      "During his inaugural address, Trump promised, \u201cWe will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry,\" but he also said that Americans will \"be able to buy the car of your choice.\u201d While there was no Biden mandate to force the purchase of EVs, his policies were aimed at encouraging Americans to buy them and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars.",
      "Just like he had a change of heart about EVs, Trump has changed his tune about Musk, who's now one of his advisers. When the pair got into an online feud in 2022, Trump ridiculed Musk for seeking support during his first term.",
      "\u201cWhen Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it\u2019s electric cars that don\u2019t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he\u2019d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, \u2018drop to your knees and beg,\u2019 and he would have done it,\u201d Trump wrote then."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump openly challenged U.S. allies on Wednesday by increasing tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% as he vowed to take back wealth \u201cstolen\u201d by other countries, drawing quick retaliation from Europe and Canada.",
      "The Republican president's use of tariffs to extract concessions from other nations points toward a possibly destructive trade war and a stark change in America\u2019s approach to global leadership. It also has destabilized the stock market and stoked anxiety about an economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America is going to take back a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries and, frankly, by incompetent U.S. leadership,\u201d Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take back our wealth, and we\u2019re going to take back a lot of the companies that left.\u201d",
      "Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%. His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \u201creciprocal\u201d rates starting on April 2.",
      "The EU announced its own countermeasures on Wednesday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was \u201capplying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,\u201d or about $28 billion. Those measures, which cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods, are due to take effect on April 1.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer responded by saying that the EU was punishing America instead of fixing what he viewed as excess capacity in steel and aluminum production.",
      "\u201cThe EU\u2019s punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States \u2013 and indeed international security \u2013 and is yet another indicator that the EU\u2019s trade and economic policies are out of step with reality,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Meeting on Wednesday with Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, Trump said \u201cof course\u201d he wants to respond to EU's retaliations and \u201cof course\u201d Ireland is taking advantage of the United States.",
      "\u201cThe EU was set up in order to take advantage of the United States,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Canada sees itself as locked in a trade war under the pretext that its center for fentanyl smuggling and that its natural resources and factories subtract from the U.S. economy instead of supporting it.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a day to day fight. This is now the second round of unjustified tariffs leveled against Canada,\u201d said M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada's foreign affairs minister. \u201cThe latest excuse is national security despite the fact that Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum adds to America\u2019s security. All the while there is a threat of further and broader tariffs on April 2 still looming. The excuse for those tariffs shifts every day.\u201d",
      "Canada is the largest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States and plans to impose retaliatory tariffs of Canadian $29.8 billion ($20.7 billion) starting Thursday in response to the U.S. taxes on the metals.",
      "Canada's new tariffs would be on steel and aluminum products, as well as U.S. goods including computers, sports equipment and water heaters worth $14.2 billion Canadian ($9.9 billion). That's in addition to the 25% counter tariffs on $30 billion Canadian (US$20.8 billion) of imports from the U.S. that were put in place on March 4 in response to other Trump import taxes that he\u2019s partially delayed by a month.",
      "Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable a day earlier that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\u201cThe higher it goes, the more likely it is they\u2019re going to build,\u201d Trump told the group. \u201cThe biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That\u2019s a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\u201d",
      "Trump on Tuesday had threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but he chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Democratic lawmakers dismissed Trump's claims that his tariffs are about national security and drug smuggling, saying they're actually about generating revenues to help cover the cost of his planned income tax cuts for the wealthy.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump knows his policies could wreck the economy, but he\u2019s doing it anyway,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cWhy are they doing all these crazy things that Americans don\u2019t like? One reason, and one reason alone: tax breaks for billionaires, the north star of the Republican party\u2019s goals.",
      "In many ways, the president is addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Outside forecasts by the Yale University Budget Lab, Tax Policy Center and others suggest that U.S. families would have the costs of the taxes passed onto them in the form of higher prices.",
      "With Wednesday's tariffs on steel and aluminum, Trump is seeking to remedy his original 2018 import taxes that were eroded by exemptions.",
      "After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn\u2019t find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the United States, they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials.",
      "Moreover, economists have found, the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase to their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it\u2019s the time to expand that assembly line?\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",
      "The top steel exporters to the U.S. are Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea and Japan, with exports from Taiwan and Vietnam growing at a fast pace, according to the International Trade Administration. Imports from China, the world's largest steel producer, account for only a small fraction of what the U.S. buys.",
      "The lion's share of U.S. aluminum imports comes from Canada."

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation slowed last month for the first time since September and a measure of underlying inflation fell to a four-year low, even as widespread tariffs threaten to send prices higher.",
      "The consumer price index increased 2.8% in February from a year ago, Wednesday\u2019s report from the Labor Department showed, down from 3% the previous month. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.1% from a year earlier, down from 3.3% in January. The core figure is the lowest since April 2021.",
      "The declines were larger than economists expected, according to a survey by data provider FactSet. Yet they remain higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. And most economists still expect inflation will remain elevated this year as Trump's tariffs kick in.",
      "\u201cToday's cooler-than-expected reading was a breath of fresh air,\u201d Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said. Yet she cautioned that the Fed is likely to keep its key rate unchanged for now until it sees further evidence of how the White House's trade and immigration policies affect the economy.",
      "On a monthly basis, inflation also came in much lower than expected. Consumer prices rose 0.2% in February from the previous month, down from a big 0.5% jump in January. And core prices rose just 0.2%, below the 0.4% increase in January. Economists watch core prices because they are typically a better guide to inflation's future path.",

      "Grocery prices were unchanged last month from January, bringing some relief to consumers grappling with a 25% jump in grocery prices from four years ago. The cost of eggs, however, jumped 10.4% in February from the previous month and are nearly 60% more expensive than a year ago.",
      "Avian flu has forced farmers to slaughter more than 160 million birds, including 30 million in January. Average egg prices hit $5.90 a dozen nationwide in February, a record high. The price had consistently been below $2 a dozen for decades before the disease struck.",

Many economists expect inflation would fall this year without the import taxes, but with tariffs imposed, they forecast inflation will stay elevated through the end of this year.",
      "Trump has pledged to impose reciprocal tariffs on any country with duties on U.S. exports on April 2.

      "The tariffs are a new blow for Britain\u2019s once-mighty steel industry, which has shrunk dramatically from its 1970s peak and now accounts for 0.1% of the economy. Thousands of jobs are due to be lost at the country\u2019s biggest steelworks, at Port Talbot in Wales, as owner Tata Steel tries to make the unprofitable plant leaner and greener.",
      "Trade body UK Steel said that in 2024, Britain exported 180,000 metric tons (198,000 U.S. tons) of steel to the United States, about 7% of the U.K.\u2019s total steel exports by volume and 9% by value. The aluminum industry says the U.S. market accounts for 10% of U.K. exports.",
      "Without pushing for an immediate retaliatory response, Unite, the U.K.\u2019s biggest union, said the government should use U.K.-produced steel in public sector projects.",
      "\u201cOur government must act decisively to protect the steel industry and its workers following the announcement of U.S. tariffs,\" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. \u201cThis is a matter of national security.\"",

      "Lawyers representing four Indonesian fishermen say they were beaten and trapped on vessels that were part of the global supply chain that provided tuna to Bumble Bee Seafoods",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Lawyers representing four Indonesian fishermen who say they were beaten and trapped on vessels that were part of the global supply chain that provided tuna to Bumble Bee Seafoods filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the canned seafood giant.",
      "It is believed to be the first such case of forced labor at sea brought against a U.S. seafood company, the men\u2019s lawyer, Agnieszka Fryszman, said.",
      "U.S. companies that benefit from forced labor and undercut other businesses need to be held accountable, Fryszman said.",
      "\u201cWhat you see is really devastating,\u201d she said.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the company headquartered in San Diego of violating the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The law allows foreigners who suffered from human trafficking to sue U.S. businesses that knew or should have known that they were profiting from forced labor.",
      "Bumble Bee did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment.",
      "The fisherman are all from villages in Indonesia and worked for longline vessels owned by Chinese companies from which Bumble Bee sourced its albacore tuna, according to the lawsuit. They say they were beaten regularly by their captains.",
      "One fisherman named Akhmad, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said he was hit by a metal hook and forced to work even after being injured on the job by a load of fish that gashed open his leg to the bone. Another fisherman, Syafi\u2019i, said he received no medical care for severe burns and was ordered to return to work to pay to eat. All the men said they asked to go home and even tried to go on strike on board, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The boats stayed out at sea while supply ships provided provisions and collected the catch. The men were strapped with debt from food bills and other fees and the threat of fines if they quit, Fryszman said.",
      "Bumble Bee had been warned of inhumane conditions in its supply chain over the years. In 2020, accounts of abusive conditions and forced labor prompted the U.S. to halt imports from a Taiwan-based fishing vessel that reportedly supplied the global tuna trading company that acquired Bumble Bee Seafoods that same year. None of these fishermen worked on that vessel.",
      "The lawsuit seeks compensation for their unpaid wages and abuse, Fryszman said. The men are also seeking systemic changes, she said. For example, they want companies like Bumble Bee to require in their contracts that the vessels in their supply chain bring in their catch rather than remain out at sea, and have medical care on board and Wi-Fi service for workers to get help.",
      "The global fishing industry has been plagued by labor abuses for years, with workers subjected to brutal treatment often with little or no pay. Congress approved legislation providing the agency with additional authority to crack down on forced labor in 2016 after an Associated Press investigation found that seafood caught by slaves in Southeast Asia was ending up in restaurants and markets around the United States.",
      "In 2018, Fryszman represented two Indonesian fishermen who said they were enslaved on an American fishing boat. They settled their lawsuit for an undisclosed amount against the vessel\u2019s California-based owner seven years after escaping and receiving special U.S. visas as victims of human trafficking."

Chinese-backed mining and construction projects are also a major source of revenue for Myanmar's military government.",

    "story": [
      "A more than 40-mile long conveyor belt filled with sand stretches from the oil fields of West Texas to New Mexico, all for the purpose of one mission: oil production",
      "KERMIT, Texas -- It's longer than the width of Rhode Island, snakes across the oil fields of the southwest U.S. and crawls at 10 mph \u2013 too slow for a truck and too long for a train.",
      "It's a new sight: the longest conveyer belt in America.",
      "Atlas Energy Solutions, a Texas-based oil field company, has installed a 42-mile long (67 kilometers) conveyer belt to transport millions of tons of sand for hydraulic fracturing. The belt the company named \u201cThe Dune Express\u201d runs from tiny Kermit, Texas, and across state borders into Lea County, New Mexico. Tall and lanky with lids that resemble solar modules, the steel structure could almost be mistaken for a roller coaster.",
      "In the remote West Texas, there are few people to marvel at the unusual machine in Kermit, a city with a population of less than 6,000, where the sand is typically hauled by tractor-trailers. During fracking, liquid is pumped into the ground at a high pressure to create holes, or fractures, that release oil. The sand helps keep the holes open as water, oil and gas flow through it.",
      "But moving the sand by truck is usually a long and potentially dangerous process, according to CEO John Turner. He said massive trucks moving sand and other industrial goods are a common site in the oil-rich Permian Basin and pose a danger to other drivers.",
      "\u201cPretty early on, the delivery of sand via truck was not only inefficient, it was dangerous,\u201d he said.",
      "The conveyor belt, with a freight capacity of 13 tons (11.79 metric tonnes), was designed to bypass and trudge alongside traffic.",
      "Innovation isn't new to the oil and gas industry, nor is the idea to use a conveyor belt to move materials around. Another conveyer belt believed to be the world\u2019s longest conveyor \u2014 at 61 miles (98.17 kilometers) long \u2014 carries phosphorous from a mine in Western Sahara on the northwest coast of Africa, according to NASA Earth Observatory.",
      "When moving sand by truck became a nuisance, an unprecedented and risky investment opportunity arose: constructing a $400 million machine to streamline the production of hydraulic fracturing. The company went public in March 2023, in part, to help pay for the conveyor belt and completed its first delivery in January, Turner said.",
      "The sand sits in a tray-shaped pan with a lid that can be taken off at any point, but most of the it gets offloaded into silos near the Texas and New Mexico border. Along its miles-long journey, the sand is sold and sent to fracking companies who move it by truck for the remainder of the trip.",
      "Keeping the rollers on the belt aligned and making sure it runs smoothly are the biggest maintenance obstacles, according to Turner. The rollers are equipped with chips that signal when its about to fail and need to be replaced. This helps prevent wear and tear and keep the machine running consistently, Turner said.",
      "The belt cuts through a large oil patch where environmentalists have long raised concerns about the industry disturbing local habitats, including those of the sagebrush lizard, which was listed as an endangered species last year by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "\u201cIn addition to that, we know that the sand will expedite further drilling nearby,\u201d said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. \u201cWe could see more drilling than we otherwise would, which means more air pollution, more spills than we otherwise would.\u201d",
      "The Dune Express currently runs for about 12 to 14 hours a day at roughly half capacity but the company expects to it to be rolling along at all hours later this year.",
      "In New Mexico, Lea County Commissioner Brad Weber said he hopes the belt alleviates traffic on a parallel highway where car crashes are frequent.",
      "\u201cI believe it\u2019s going to make a very positive impact here,\u201d he said.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Junior Bridgeman, a basketball standout who led Louisville to a Final Four, starred for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks and then launched an even more successful career as a businessman with stakes in restaurants, publishing and the Bucks franchise, died Tuesday. He was 71.",
      "Bridgeman was a popular fixture in Louisville after his playing days, and Mayor Craig Greenberg announced his death, saying the city had \u201clost a kind, generous and groundbreaking legend.\u201d",
      "\"He was an All-American at U of L ... and a self-made billionaire,\" Greenberg said in a statement. \u201cYet I will most remember Junior Bridgeman for his quiet, impactful assistance to others in need\u201d as well as his love for his family and his \u201cnever-ending support for our community.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, praised his friend as a highly successful businessman and generous philanthropist who loved his alma mater and \u201cthe city he called home.\u201d",
      "According to media reports, Bridgeman suffered a medical emergency at a Louisville hotel during a fundraising event Tuesday.",
      "Tributes poured in for a man who excelled on the hardwood and in corporate boardrooms.",
      "\u201cJunior was the ultimate entrepreneur who built on his impactful 12-year NBA playing career by becoming a highly respected and successful business leader,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \u201cHe served as a mentor to generations of NBA players and athletes across sports who were eager to learn from him about what it takes to thrive in the business world.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman, a native of East Chicago, Indiana, played for Hall of Fame coach Denny Crum at Louisville. In three seasons, he scored 1,348 points, grabbed 657 rebounds and in his senior season led the Cardinals to the 1975 Final Four, where they lost to eventual national champion UCLA in a 75-74 thriller.",
      "Bridgeman was involved in one of the biggest trades in NBA history at the start of his professional career. After the Los Angeles Lakers selected Bridgeman with the eighth pick in the 1975 draft, they sent him to Milwaukee as part of the trade that brought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to the West Coast.",
      "Bridgeman\u2019s 711 games played for Milwaukee ranks third in franchise history, behind only Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. His No. 2 jersey was retired by the Bucks in 1988.",
      "\u201cHis hard work and perseverance led him to become one of the nation\u2019s top business leaders and, last September, Junior\u2019s professional life came full circle when he returned to the Bucks family as an owner,\u201d the Bucks said in a statement. \u201cHis memory will always be an inspiration to the Bucks organization.\u201d",
      "The Bucks announced Bridgeman had bought a stake in the team last year at a news conference that included co-owner Jimmy Haslam, coach Doc Rivers, general manager Jon Horst and many players. Bridgeman said afterward he had a 10% stake.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to get back involved with the team in a different way and take advantage of it was something that was kind of a dream,\u201d Bridgeman said at the time.",
      "Prior to Milwaukee's game Tuesday night, Rivers said Bridgeman was a strong role model.",
      "\u201cThink about that kid growing up, wanting to be an NBA player, probably his dream, and he turned that dream into becoming an NBA owner,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe is the exact model the league should use every day when they are talking to our young players.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman played for the Bucks from 1975-84 and then spent two years with the Los Angeles Clippers before coming back to Milwaukee for his final NBA season in 1986-87. He scored 11,517 points (averaging 13.6 per game) in his career. He ranks seventh in Bucks history in field goals (4,142), ninth in points (9,892) and 10th in minutes (18,054).",
      "After his playing days, Bridgeman turned that same drive into a successful business career.",
      "\u201cWhile his play on the court was exceptional, it was as a leader in the business community that Junior truly excelled,\u201d University of Louisville President Kim Schatzel said in a statement.",
      "Bridgeman was a longtime franchisee for Wendy\u2019s and Chili\u2019s restaurants, at one time operating more than 450 locations in 20 states, the university said. He became a bottler for Coca-Cola and bought Ebony and Jet magazines, the school said.",
      "\u201cI had the privilege of playing against him, and I'll never forget how he had one of the sweetest jump shots in the NBA,\u201d retired Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson wrote on X. \u201cWhat people don't realize is Junior didn't make a fortune as a player, but he turned what he earned into something extraordinary, becoming a billionaire African American businessman in this country.\u201d",
      "Bridgeman was part of the foursome that owns Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. He also served on the boards of Churchill Downs racetrack, the University of Louisville and Fifth Third Bank, among others. He and his wife, Doris, hosted a Kentucky Derby party that served as a fundraiser.",
      "\u201cHe is the blueprint to so many current and former athletes across sports that success doesn't end when you're done playing,\u201d Johnson wrote.",
      "Besides his wife, he is survived by children Eden, Justin and Ryan.",

    "story": [
      "Former Wisconsin star Baylee Marabella had to play hockey alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area",
      "MILWAUKEE -- When Baylee Marabella got interested in ice hockey while growing up in Wisconsin, she had to play alongside boys up until high school because she couldn\u2019t find a girls team in her area.",
      "That isn\u2019t as much of a problem in hockey hotbeds such as Wisconsin anymore with a steady increase in the number of girls playing the sport. That trend helped launch the coaching career of Marabella, who was known as Baylee Wellhausen when she played on three Frozen Four teams with Wisconsin from 2014-18.",
      "Marabella now coaches Milwaukee School of Engineering, which just finished its inaugural season in Division III competition. It\u2019s one of more than two dozen D-III schools to start women\u2019s hockey teams over the last decade, capitalizing on the relative lack of cost compared to doing so in Division I.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Marabella said of the rapid growth.",
      "MSOE was one of 78 schools to play women\u2019s ice hockey this year at the Division III level, which doesn't offer athletic scholarships. That represents a 50% increase from 2015, when there were 52 schools playing the sport at this level.",
      "Marabella believes those numbers can keep going up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be more and more girls who want to play college (hockey), so as we keep moving forward, the demand is going to be higher,\u201d Marabella said.",
      "Women\u2019s hockey in North America is on the rise and not only at the Division III level. The Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League is two months from completing its second season amid signs that attendance is up. The six-team league is drawing an average of 7,300 fans this season \u2013 up from 5,500 last year \u2013 and might expand by as many as two franchise next season.",
      "USA Hockey had 73,083 registrations among girls in 2023-24, a 47.4% increase over its 2013-14 total (49,587). Boys registrations increased by 4.8% over the same time, from 302,303 to 316,737.",
      "\u201cOverall, the skill level has gotten so much better over the years that it becomes one of those sports that was almost a no-brainer to be adding at the Division III level,\u201d said Joe Cranston, who coaches defending champion Wisconsin-River Falls, which hosts the D-III championship March 28-30. The 12-team tournament begins Saturday on campus sites.",
      "There are 44 women's hockey programs in Division I and Division II, a 12.8% rise from 2015 (39). The two divisions compete in a single national tournament, which ends this year with the Women's Frozen Four March 21-23 in Minneapolis.",
      "The modest growth at the higher level can be blamed on the bigger costs with adding a D-I program. Ice availability is a factor for any team at any level, and setting budgets is difficult for any athletic director dealing with the NCAA House settlement and name, image and likeness compensation questions.",
      "Minnesota reported operating expenses of a little over $3.6 million for women\u2019s hockey in 2023-24. Michigan released a feasibility study saying expenses would run about $4.5 million annually if it started a women\u2019s hockey program.",
      "By contrast, Wisconsin-River Falls reported $197,087 in women\u2019s hockey expenses in its 2024 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act survey.",
      "Michelle McAteer has a unique perspective, as a new commissioner of a Division I conference (the Western Collegiate Hockey Association) who finished a 14-season run coaching Division III program Augsburg last year.",
      "\u201cHockey\u2019s an expensive sport to operate, and to operate a rink is an expensive investment,\u201d McAteer said. \u201cAt the Division III level, not everyone has their own rinks on campus. You can get by playing in community rinks and renting. The facility demands at the Division I level are quite different. The investment and infrastructure are a lot more. Everything is more. They have more significant travel. They have a more significant equipment budget, the staffing differences.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s probably enough talent nowadays to accommodate more Division I programs. The difference is apparent on the ice.",
      "\u201cTen to 12 years ago, there were a lot of teams at the Division I level that might have had one good line, a line-and-a-half, maybe two,\u201d said coach Mark Johnson, whose Badgers have been the top-ranked team in women's hockey most of the season. \u201cNow everybody\u2019s got two or three lines, maybe four lines, that can compete and play at a real high level.\u201d",
      "Because the schools in larger divisions haven\u2019t added women\u2019s hockey programs at a rate that correlates with the growth in the sport at the youth level, it\u2019s created more opportunities for Division III schools.",
      "\u201cI have kids on my team who were All-Americans 15 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cKids who were Division I players 10 years ago who couldn\u2019t make my team now.\u201d",
      "Plattsburgh State won five titles in a six-year stretch from 2014-19, but there\u2019s been a different champion for each of the last five tournaments.",
      "Norwich won in 2018, Plattsburgh State in 2019, Middlebury in 2022, Gustavus Adolphus in 2023 and Wisconsin-River Falls last year. There were no Division III championships in 2020 or 2021 due to the pandemic.",
      "\u201cMost years there\u2019s maybe three or four teams that could win it all,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cI think this year there\u2019s probably twice that, probably seven or eight teams that could win the whole thing.\u201d",
      "SUNY Oswego athletic director Wendy McManus, the head of the NCAA Division III women\u2019s hockey committee, says smaller schools will continue adding the sport as long as youth participation stays strong.",
      "\u201cI do think eventually it will level off,\u201d McManus said. \u201cI say that because you don\u2019t see California schools or true West Coast schools playing hockey that much. We say \u2018West\u2019 is basically Minnesota, Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "That growth has provided welcome opportunities that might not have been available a decade earlier.",
      "For instance, MSOE\u2019s roster includes forward Hannah Baumann of Wausau, Wisconsin, who said she grew up idolizing Marabella and was a big Badgers fan. Baumann used to have to drive an hour to practice because of the relative lack of girls hockey teams.",
      "There now are more girls teams than ever, and some gather in the stands for MSOE\u2019s home games. That has particular meaning for forward Helen Bechthold, who grew up in the Milwaukee area playing for one of those youth programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool to see they have all-girls teams playing now, because when I was playing, they didn\u2019t have all-girls teams,\u201d said Bechthold, who grew up playing with boys. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see. A lot of them were like, \u2018You played where we play\u2019 and stuff like that. That definitely makes me happy. I\u2019m happy they have that opportunity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Tristan Jarry is off to a strong start in his return to the NHL",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Tristan Jarry's career was at a crossroads in mid-January. The Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender was struggling and even worse, the franchise's faith in him appeared to be shot.",
      "Things grew so bleak for Jarry at the end of a stretch in which he dropped six straight starts that general manager Kyle Dubas \u2014 the same man who'd signed Jarry to a five-year deal shortly after taking over in the summer of 2023 \u2014 made the unusual decision to send Jarry to the minors.",
      "Not just to get some reps in, but seemingly for good.",
      "Players with two All-Star appearances and millions in the bank typically don't make their way back after a fall like that. At least not with the same team.",
      "Yet there Jarry was on Tuesday night standing inside PPG Paints Arena, turning aside 36 shots in a 3-2 overtime victory over Vegas that offered hope that while Pittsburgh's season is all but lost, Jarry's tenure with the only NHL club he's ever known might not be.",
      "Yes, those six-plus weeks in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton riding the bus to Bridgeport and Lehigh Valley were \u201ctough\u201d as he put it. They may also have been necessary.",
      "\u201cIt was something I had to work through,\u201d Jarry said. \u201cSomething I need to look at myself in the mirror and just say \u2018I need to have a better game.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Penguins called Jarry back up quietly earlier this month when 23-year-old Joel Blomqvist \u2014 potentially the club's goalie of the future \u2014 had struggles of his own during a somewhat extended NHL look.",
      "Jarry returned to the lineup on Sunday in a road victory over likely playoff-bound Minnesota. Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan called Jarry \u201cspectacular\u201d while outdueling future Hall of Famer and former Penguin Marc-Andre Fleury.",
      "Sullivan saw enough to give Jarry the nod again against Pacific Division-leading Vegas, a potentially fraught assignment for a player who hasn't looked comfortable playing at home this season.",
      "Yet the jitters \u2014 particularly the early-game ones that have popped up frequently during a season in which he has allowed a first-shot goal six times \u2014 never materialized. Jarry turned aside the first puck the Golden Knights threw his way and quickly settled into the game.",
      "Vegas, which is charging toward the postseason, dominated for long stretches. Jarry responded by showcasing the athleticism that's always been there and the confidence, which admittedly hasn't.",
      "He was at his best in the third period. During one sequence Jarry turned aside a breakaway and a wraparound attempt within seconds of each other to protect a one-goal lead. When the whistle blew, the crowd that reveled in booing him in mid-winter was cheering his name instead.",
      "Though Vegas tied it late on a slap shot by Noah Hanifin, Pittsburgh prevailed in overtime to secure two points in a season in which they've been hard to come by. Jarry's uneven play is one of the major reasons the Penguins will likely miss the playoffs for a third straight year.",
      "Yet if he can find something over the next month, he could perhaps make his contract that features an average cap hit of $5 million palatable for another team to take on. Or maybe a goaltender who has been part of the problem during Pittsburgh's swoon could end up being part of the solution.",
      "\u201cHe's got a long body of work in Pittsburgh that suggests strongly that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender,\u201d Sullivan said of Jarry. \"We\u2019ve said that on many occasions ... He\u2019s made the All-Star team twice, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidence. There\u2019s substance there.\u201d",
      "Jarry needs to pair that substance with consistency and maybe a dash of toughness too. He's been around long enough \u2014 Jarry made his NHL debut nearly eight years ago \u2014 to know two solid games doesn't mean he's \u201cback.\u201d Every meaningful stat, from goals against average (3.15) to save percentage (.893), ranks as the worst of his career.",
      "There's more work to be done. Probably a lot more. Yet he finds himself in a better place than he was in mid-January. He believes being sent down freed him in a way. He had nothing left to lose, so Jarry headed to the AHL with a \u201cfree mind\" that has helped pave the way for a comeback that seemed remote not long ago.",
      "\u201cI think just over my time that I\u2019ve been playing in the NHL, I\u2019ve played a lot of good hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to continue that.\u201d",
      "Given Pittsburgh's spot in the standings and the need to get a feel once and for all whether he can reclaim the team's No. 1 goaltending spot, Jarry probably won't lack for opportunities down the stretch. What he does with them will say plenty about his future.",
      "\u201cFor whatever reason it didn\u2019t go the way any of us hoped (early in the season),\u201d Sullivan said. \"I think he\u2019s just showing what he\u2019s capable of, quite honestly.\u201d",

      "World Boxing has added China to its growing list of members",
      "World Boxing has added China to its growing list of members, reaching another major goal in its quest to keep boxing in the Olympics.",
      "The still-new governing body also announced the additions of the national federations of Turkey, Sudan, Greece, Slovakia and Montenegro on Wednesday. World Boxing now has 84 national federations among its membership after having only 37 at the conclusion of the Paris Olympics seven months ago.",
      "The Chinese Boxing Federation's decision to join is yet another positive sign for World Boxing, which received provisional recognition from the IOC last month as the new governing body for the sport ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.",
      "\u201cThe addition of six more members to our ever-increasing membership is further evidence of the widespread support that exists across our sport for the work that World Boxing is doing to deliver a better future for boxers and ensure that boxing remains at the heart of the Olympic movement,\u201d World Boxing president Boris Van Der Vorst said.",
      "World Boxing was founded in April 2023 in an attempt to preserve the sport's Olympic future after the International Boxing Association was suspended in 2019 and banished from the Olympic movement in 2023 following decades of judging scandals, bizarre leadership decisions and innumerable financial misdeeds.",
      "While World Boxing swiftly signed up most of the top Western federations fed up with the Russia-dominated IBA's intransigence, the breakaway body knew it would face difficulty in landing top federations who either rely financially on the banned body or align politically with its Russian leadership.",
      "China has emerged as a top boxing nation since the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Its team finished second in the medal table in Paris last year with three gold medals and two silvers.",
      "Turkey also has a thriving federation, winning two silver medals and a bronze in Paris.",
      "With China in the fold, World Boxing now has a robust Asian membership that includes about two dozen members \u2014 including Uzbekistan, the most powerful boxing nation in recent Olympics after winning five gold medals in Paris.",
      "Boxing still is not officially on the program for the Los Angeles Games, but Kazakh boxing superstar Gennady Golovkin is heading a World Boxing commission to cement the body\u2019s future in the Olympic movement. The IOC ran the last two Olympic boxing tournaments, but has repeatedly said a new governing body must run future tournaments if boxing stays on the program.",

      "Woods posted the development on his social media accounts without saying how long he expected to be out or any other details except that the surgery went well.",
      "\u201cAs I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left Achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured,\u201d Woods said.",
      "He said he had a minimally invasive Achilles tendon repair for a ruptured tendon that the doctor said went smoothly. Such surgeries involve smaller incisions, and the recovery time is quicker. But most recoveries take at least a month before someone can even put weight on their foot.",
      "Two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer had a tear in his Achilles tendon last year that kept him out for three months.",
      "Dr. Charlton Stucken of the Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach performed the surgery and said in the post, \u201cThe surgery went smoothly, and we expect a full recovery.\u201d",
      "The Masters is April 10-13.",
      "Woods set the tournament record last year by making the cut for the 24th time in a row. He missed the cut in the other three majors in 2024. The British Open in July was the last time he played against top competition. He played with his son in the 36-hole PNC Championship in December. Woods also has played his TGL indoor circuit, the 18-hole Seminole Pro-Member last week and a round with President Donald Trump a month ago.",
      "Woods entered the Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines until withdrawing because he was still processing the Feb. 4 death of his mother, Kultida.",
      "Woods had a sixth back surgery last September. He had issues with the Achilles tendon before, injuring the left one from hitting a shot at the Masters with an awkward stance. He also cited the left Achilles tendon in withdrawing from The Players Championship in 2011, when he was out for two months.",
      "Woods badly damaged his right leg and ankle in a February 2021 car crash outside Los Angeles.",

      "Filmmaker Deon Taylor has built a pipeline for pro athletes to transition into a filmmaking post career with the Hidden Empire Sports Collective",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Isaac Ukwu's sights were solely set on just playing in the NFL \u2014 until two season-ending knee injuries in college served as a harsh reality of football's fragility.",
      "The setbacks reshaped Ukwu's perspective, showing him that football was part of him, but not all of him. Even after signing with the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent last year, the defensive end knew he needed more than just the game.",
      "So, when the NFL introduced a program for players exploring careers in film and television, he seized the chance to build his off-the-field legacy.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t let your entire identity be football,\u201d said Ukwu, an aspiring actor, who was one of 20-plus former and active NFL players selected to join film training sessions at the NFL Career Tour hosted by Hidden Empire and Skydance Sports. During the three-day sessions, athletes explored the nuances of filmmaking \u2014 learning behind-the-camera roles like directing, producing and other essential elements of bringing a project to life \u2014 while also sharpening their skills as actors.",
      "The sessions recently concluded with the creation of short films at the Hidden Empire studios in Santa Monica, California. The company is led by independent filmmaker Deon Taylor, best known for \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d and \u201cThe Intruder,\u201d and his wife Roxanne Avent Taylor.",
      "\u201cThis experience is really invaluable,\u201d said Ukwu, who hopes to break into acting before eventually exploring directing and producing.",
      "Some of the players featured in the sessions included Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, Cincinnati Bengals lineman Orlando Brown, Pittsburgh Steelers defensive lineman Cam Heyward, Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins and Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Daiyan Henley.",
      "It\u2019s the third year of program \u2014 which has featured panelists including entertainers Tyrese Gibson and Master P and retired NFL player Vernon Davis.",
      "\u201cThey let you know there\u2019s a way to enter that door,\u201d said Heyward, a seven-time Pro Bowler, who's interested in becoming a director or producer. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you have to come from a film background. But if you appreciate films and you\u2019re a fan of it, there\u2019s a space for you.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s vision is to redefine storytelling and build a pipeline for authentic, culture-driven narratives straight from the world\u2019s top athletes.",
      "He sees the Hidden Empire Sports Collective \u2014 launched last month \u2014 as a key step in helping athletes prepare for life beyond the game. This new entertainment division focuses on amplifying athletes\u2019 voices through content creation and intellectual property development.",
      "\u201cWe should be educating athletes on how to actually create content, make IP themselves,\u201d said Taylor, who played basketball in East Germany before he ultimately directed other notable titles such as \u201cMeet the Blacks\" and \u201cFatale.\u201d He\u2019s become a major player in the independent filmmaking space.",
      "\u201cBut then more importantly, it\u2019s being a sound information highway for them to understand how they could take something that was great in their life or something that was painful in their lives, tweak it and make it become something that could be content,\u201d he said.",
      "The sports collective has partnered with several athletes, landing developmental deals with stars like boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr., NBA champion Scottie Pippen and Los Angeles Clippers star James Harden. One upcoming project is a four-part docuseries on Mayweather's life.",
      "With the training sessions, Taylor believes athletes can find inspiration through the sports collective and Ephraim Salaam, who successfully transitioned from the NFL to Hollywood. After playing 13 seasons in the league, he has built a career as a screenwriter.",
      "Salaam stressed to pro athletes the importance of owning their stories. He noted that they can offer a deeper perspective on their lives that might captivate the masses.",
      "\u201cThe No. 1 thing I always tell them is \u2018You\u2019re one of one,\u2019\u201d said Salaam, who is the collective's president of talent strategy and creative executive. \u201cYou\u2019ve been able to look and see life through a lens very few people have. That information is valuable in a writers room.\u201d",
      "In just a few days, athletes dove into filmmaking with the same intensity they bring to studying playbooks.",
      "Players broke into different groups to film scenes for their own movie using iPhones. They went through career and educational panels along with interactive workshops that included a tour of Paramount Studios.",
      "Many assumed acting was their standout skill \u2014 until they realized every role on a project is just as crucial to the final score.",
      "For Okwu, he learned that a film producer wears many hats, much like an NFL general manager, overseeing everything from reading scripts to securing directors and funding projects. He credits Taylor for guiding him and his peers through their early filmmaking journey.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if I was in high school and I had access to Dan Campbell just to talk and coach me up on some things that can lead my success in the future,\u201d said Okwu.",
      "The project took shape after an NFL Career Tour stop, an initiative designed to provide insight into the entertainment industry. This tour is part of Skydance Sports, a joint NFL-Skydance venture offering athletes a behind-the-scenes look at sports programming and storytelling.",
      "The collaboration aims to equip players with the tools to transition into media, content creation and production to share their own narratives with the world.",
      "\u201cWithout the players, there is no game,\u201d said Tracy Perlman, senior vice president of player operation for the NFL. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to build athletes. We want to build people.\"",
      "Dion Dawkins said the opportunities are ripe for the taking.",
      "\u201cYou have to create your lane without that helmet on,\u201d said Dawkins, a four-time Pro Bowler who's an aspiring actor with a big personality. He gets inspired watching former NFL players who transitioned into the TV and film industry such as Salaam, Terry Crews, Laith Wallschleger and Vernon Davis.",
      "\u201cIf you think you\u2019re bigger than a football player, you have avenues that can show it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we have OGs that have done it, and doing it currently, it gives you that bit of ... I\u2019m not an outsider, I\u2019m an insider. As long as I conduct and control myself in the right manner, I\u2019ll have a chance.\u201d",

      "Sign stealing in baseball",
      "GENEVA -- Sign stealing in baseball. Match fixing in soccer. Doping allegations in swimming. Now ski jumping has its own scandal.",
      "Cheating by Norway team officials manipulating ski suits has shaken a national reputation for fair play and high-minded principles at their home Nordic world championships, where the host team dominated the medal table.",
      "Two Olympic gold medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andr\u00e9 Forfang, were disqualified from the large hill event in Trondheim days after Lindvik soared to become world champion on the normal hill.",
      "Though both athletes were backed by the Norwegian team insisting they knew nothing about deliberately altered ski suits, their head coach and equipment manager confessed and were suspended.",
      "The scandal has shocked the ski jumping world, raising questions about how widespread this practice is, and tarnished Norway\u2019s standing for honesty in sports.",
      "What has emerged involves team officials manipulating pre-approved and microchipped suits to increase their size and improve aerodynamics to help athletes fly further.",
      "It was revealed in footage secretly filmed from behind a curtain then sent by a whistle blower to international media. An official from the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) said the illegal alterations were only subsequently confirmed by tearing apart the seams of the crotch area on the offending Norwegian ski suits.",
      "The scandal has unfolded in Norway which always scores high in Transparency International\u2019s anti-corruption index, tied for fifth in the most recent global ranking.",
      "Norwegian sports officials also led on controversial issues by taking public positions in 2022 in refusing to host Russian athletes days after the full invasion of Ukraine and challenging soccer World Cup host Qatar on human rights.",
      "The same Norwegian ski federation that helped push FIS to exclude Russians three years ago now finds its staff and star athletes under investigation by the Switzerland-based governing body.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that matters for FIS is to leave this process 100% convinced that the sport is free from any form of manipulation,\u201d its secretary general Michel Vion said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Athletes and officials from across the world left Trondheim on Sunday sad and disappointed, FIS race director for men\u2019s ski jumping, Sandro Pertile, told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cNorway is a country that we all know as a leader in human rights, in equality, integration. I cannot believe that there is a (cheating) system,\u201d Pertile said in an online call Tuesday, suggesting there was \u201ca few individuals that went really far over the limits.\u201d",
      "If the infractions seemed obscure and technical to non-fans, the breach of trust was severe: \u201cThis action was somehow killing our principles, our style, our joy for our discipline,\u201d Pertile said.",
      "The Norwegian federation acted when FIS officials found evidence that proved what the secret footage alleged, and had led to formal protests from Austria, Slovenia and Poland.",
      "Norway men\u2019s head coach Magnus Brevig and equipment manager Adrian Livelten admitted they had cheated, though just on one occasion, ahead of the large hill event held Saturday.",
      "\u201cWe regret it like dogs, and I\u2019m terribly sorry that this happened,\u201d Brevig said. \u201cI don\u2019t really have anything else to say other than that we got carried away in our bubble.\u201d",
      "Livelten apologized to the disqualified athletes plus \u201csponsors, the jumping family and the Norwegian people\u201d for an act of cheating he said was \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was an extremely high level manipulation,\u201d race director Pertile said of the Norwegian actions that were \u201cabsolutely by far the worst\u201d in his five years in the job. \u201cWe destroyed the suit to be able to find this adjustment.\u201d",
      "The Italian official said alterations were not detected by eye and only were revealed by examining the seams of the crotch area of the ski suits after the competition.",
      "Extra material in the same color had been inserted that added weight and helped to lower the material between an athlete's legs as they took off into the flight phase. More surface area hitting the air helps add to flight time, Pertile said.",
      "FIS previously said a 5% bigger surface area of a suit helps an athlete fly further, though the exact distance added is not known, Pertile said.",
      "FIS has an extensive 11-page document of rules for measuring and verifying ski jumpers' suits during the season. Multiple RFID chips are attached and noted on a FIS register, after which a suit must not be altered. Any attempt to remove a chip should make the suit ineligible and the chips are deactivated.",
      "One suit is allowed at World Cup events and two more for a world championships or Winter Olympics, though just one is used on each competition day.",
      "FIS investigators are now likely to want to closely inspect all the Norwegian team suits, in men's and women's ski jumping and Nordic combined, at the world championships.",
      "Lindvik's gold medal in normal hill is sure to be looked at, though it is unclear how far back an investigation could reach for results at World Cup events this season or beyond to previous seasons. Lindvik was Olympic champion in large hill at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.",
      "The ski jumping World Cup season continues for three more weekends, starting Thursday in Oslo.",

      "The NCAA selection committee will have some juggling to do before the bracket comes out Sunday to keep March Madness from looking like an extension of the Southeastern Conference's regular season.",
      "With the country's deepest league in line to place between 12 and 14 teams in the tournament, some long-held guidelines drawn to help set the matchups will have to give way, bringing the possibility that conference rivals could face each other as early as the second round or the Sweet 16.",
      "\u201cWe will move it to try to ensure they don't play each other too frequently,\u201d the chair of the selection committee, North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham, said Wednesday in a call to preview the selection. \u201cBut it is a reality of where we are today.\u201d",
      "The reality is shaped thanks in part to a flurry of realignment that has left college sports with four megaconferences. Three of those will gobble up nearly half of the 68 spots in the tournament. The record for a conference came in 2011 when the Big East placed 11 teams in the bracket.",
      "Some projections have the SEC earning up to 14 spots, the Big Ten getting as many as 10 and the Big 12 earning up to eight. Of those 32 projected spots, seven could go to teams that were in different conferences as recently as 2023 \u2014 programs such as Oklahoma, Oregon and BYU.",
      "There will be some big-picture repercussions from all this realignment. In a notable development earlier this week, Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark got on board with an idea to expand the tournament to 76 teams in a move that would favor Power Four conferences.",
      "More urgently, though, having so many teams from so few conferences will force the 12 members of the selection committee, who are holed up in a conference room in Indiana this week, to make some nontraditional decisions.",
      "The NCAA bracketing principles frown on teams that have played three times in a season from meeting before the Elite Eight. Likewise, they urge the committee to avoid potential pairings between teams that have played twice coming before the Sweet 16. But, in a tweak that was put in for this season, the principles note that those rules \u201ccan be relaxed if a league has nine or more teams in the tournament.\u201d",
      "Cunningham said the committee's biggest priority will be getting the seedings right, an exercise that could make it more difficult to avoid these early matchups.",
      "\u201cWe really try to keep everybody on the same seed line\" they've earned, he said. \u201cWe don't want to move them to a different seed line because that really does impact the tournament. But it'll be a little bit trickier this year.\"",
      "The SEC's dominance is showing up not only in the sheer volume of teams but also where they land. Auburn is a lock for a No. 1 seed, with Florida considered a slight favorite to edge out Tennessee and Alabama for another.",
      "Among the biggest questions is whether the top overall seed in the tournament will go to Auburn or Duke, which this week supplanted the Tigers at No. 1 in the AP Top 25. The irony there is that Duke is one of only three teams from the ACC projected to make the field of 68, which would mark the hoops powerhouse's lowest total in 25 years.",

      "Kimi Antonelli once hid in a stack of tires to get through security and into the Formula 1 paddock",
      "Andrea Kimi Antonelli once hid in a stack of tires to get through security and into the Formula 1 paddock. Now the 18-year-old Italian is Lewis Hamilton's successor at Mercedes.",
      "Antonelli is among F1's biggest intake of new drivers in years as top teams put some trust in youth. Six of the 20 drivers on the 2025 grid are starting their first full seasons in F1. Some could potentially compete for wins. Others already risk losing a hard-won F1 seat.",
      "An unexpectedly talented Formula 2 field last season came at a time when some F1 teams were keen to move on from older drivers like Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas. Switching in 2025 gives teams a chance to let youngsters gain experience before the F1 car design rules change radically for 2026.",
      "Here's a look at the rookie class:",
      "Stepping into a seven-time champion's shoes at Mercedes puts the spotlight on Antonelli, who is set to become the third-youngest F1 driver ever. The Italian wants to be known as just \u201cthe next Mercedes driver\u201d because of Hamilton's legacy. The first time Antonelli visited an F1 paddock was age eight in 2014 when his father Marco \u2014 who ran a team in a support series \u2014 hid him in a stack of tires under an umbrella to get past security and into the German Grand Prix. \u201cThat was a really cool experience,\u201d he said last month. Antonelli had a stellar record in junior series and was sixth in F2 last year but a heavy crash in practice for Mercedes at Monza in August was a tough introduction to F1.",
      "The Red Bull driver is the odd man out in this list because he\u2019s taken part in 11 F1 races since 2023, though never a full season. He says he\u2019ll feel \u201cmore like a rookie\u201d at the start of the season on tracks he hasn\u2019t raced before. Partnering four-time champion Max Verstappen as the replacement for Perez is a daunting task for Lawson, who knocked Verstappen out of qualifying in only his third F1 race in Singapore in 2023. The New Zealander needs to justify Red Bull\u2019s decision to elevate him over his 2024 teammate \u2014 and former roommate \u2014 Yuki Tsunoda, who outperformed Lawson over their six races together last year.",
      "It's less than a year since Bearman burst onto the scene in F1 with a combative seventh-place finish for Ferrari in Saudi Arabia while Carlos Sainz Jr. was sidelined because of surgery. He'd never previously raced in Jeddah and was racing with two days' notice. Bearman beat experienced teammate Nico H\u00fclkenberg in two races for Haas later that year and is now a full-time Haas driver for 2025. Bearman remains part of Ferrari's junior program but displacing regular Ferrari drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc is unlikely any time soon.",
      "The son of legendary motorcycle world champion Mick Doohan enters 2025 with his F1 career under threat as soon as it has begun. Alpine's decision to sign ex-Williams driver Franco Colapinto as reserve means a would-be replacement is available if Doohan doesn't impress team management. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have pressure on your shoulders because you\u2019re in such a cut-throat sport,\u201d Doohan said. The Australian driver placed third in F2 in 2023 but didn't race at all last year until a surprise entry for the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Finishing 15th, he was far off the pace of teammate Pierre Gasly in seventh.",
      "Lawson's promotion to Red Bull left an opening at its second team, now rebranded Racing Bulls, for F2 runner-up Hadjar. The French driver arrives at a team with a history of changing drivers mid-season if they don't perform. Even eight-time Grand Prix winner Daniel Ricciardo didn't last a full year there in 2024.",
      "Despite winning the F2 title last season, beating Hadjar, Antonelli and Bearman, Bortoleto's arrival in F1 has been overshadowed by his former rivals. That's partly because his new team Sauber struggled last year and is marking time before a full rebrand as the Audi works team in 2026. With a helmet design paying tribute to three-time champion Ayrton Senna, Bortoleto is F1's first full-time Brazilian driver since 2017.",

    "story": [
      "The race for the two wild-card playoff spots in the NHL\u2019s Eastern Conference is full of surprises",
      "The Ottawa Senators last qualified for the playoffs in 2017, while the Columbus Blue Jackets have only won a round once in more than two decades of existence and none since before the pandemic.",
      "The New York Rangers were the top team in the NHL last season before making a run to the Eastern Conference final and losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. The Boston Bruins are just two years removed from setting league records for wins and points in a season.",
      "Now those four teams are competing for the two wild-card spots in the East, coming from very different directions.",
      "It's a surprise the Blue Jackets are in the race at all, the Senators have showed they belong and the Rangers and Bruins have clawed back in it after underachieving for several months.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s giving up, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Columbus general manager Don Waddell said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tight race the rest of the way. We\u2019re just hoping that we can continue to win more games than we lose, and if we do that we\u2019ll be in good shape.\u201d",
      "The pesky Sens won five of their first six games in March to get in the driver's seat for the seventh seed behind likely playoff teams Washington, Florida, Carolina, Toronto, Tampa Bay and New Jersey. They have 73 standings points with 18 games remaining.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about being in the playoff picture right now,\u201d alternate captain Claude Giroux said. \u201cIt\u2019s just how we\u2019re playing. How we want to play, we have a belief that it\u2019s going to make us be in the playoffs.\"",
      "First-year coach Travis Green has set a competitive tone since training camp.",
      "\"He had us ready from the get-go,\" said veteran winger David Perron, who won the Cup with St. Louis in 2019. \"There\u2019s going to be some stretches where you don\u2019t play as good, whatever it is, either individually or the team. I think he\u2019s done a good job to kind of reset us at the right times.\"",
      "Captain Brady Tkachuk has a team-best 27 goals, center Tim St\u00fctzle has 21 points in his past 16 games to lead Ottawa with 66 and only reigning MVP Nathan MacKinnon has scored more than defenseman Jake Sanderson this month. Add some great goaltending from 2023 Vezina Trophy winner Linus Ullmark, and the fun times are rolling on the ice in Canada's capital.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Perron said. \u201cYou play those kind of meaningful games and those important games that we are right now and that we have been for a little bit, it\u2019s the best feeling.\u201d",
      "The death in late August of top forward Johnny Gaudreau, who was killed along with his brother, Matthew, while riding their bicycles near their New Jersey hometown on the eve of their sister Katie's wedding was the latest shock to a tortured organization that was three years removed from goaltender Matiss Kivlenieks dying in a July Fourth fireworks accident.",
      "With Waddell taking over and installing Dean Evason as coach, the expectations on the ice this season were very low \u2014 and that was before captain Boone Jenner had shoulder surgery before opening night. Columbus was a 15-1 long shot to even make the playoffs and as high as 25-1 in November on BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "Then point-a-game defenseman Zach Werenski led the way and he and his teammates hold the second and final wild-card spot with 70 points and 18 games left.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just leaving it all out there every night, and we\u2019re giving ourselves a chance to win,\u201d Werenski said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun. It\u2019s been one of the more fun years I\u2019ve had, and it\u2019s been a battle. We\u2019ve been battling every night and it\u2019s not been smooth sailing all the time, but I\u2019ve just really enjoyed battling with these guys.\u201d",
      "Waddell conceded he \u201ckept waiting for the bubble to burst,\u201d but then the likes of tough guy Mathieu Olivier, young Adam Fantilli and Kent Johnson and veteran Sean Monahan \u2014 a close friend of Gaudreau's \u2014 stepped up to keep things rolling against all odds.",
      "\u201cIt feels like this year we were turning a corner,\u201d Olivier said. \u201cWe\u2019re making a really realistic push for playoffs here, which is our goal.\u201d",
      "Bringing back elite center J.T. Miller has paid big dividends for the Rangers, who were in a funk until January. Miller has 16 points in 15 games since the trade from Vancouver, and it has also helped that top players such as Mika Zibanejad, Artemi Panarin and Vincent Trocheck have raised their level.",
      "They've lost four in a row, but the Rangers with 68 points and 17 games remaining are right in the mix, two points back of Columbus.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a playoff fight right now,\u201d defenseman Will Borgen told reporters in Winnipeg after losing 2-1 to the Jets on Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re battling for every point. ... We\u2019ve got to string along some wins if we want to make the playoffs.\u201d",
      "A little like the Rangers, the Bruins bought and sold \u2014 but mostly sold \u2014 at the trade deadline, sending Brad Marchand to Florida, Brandon Carlo to Toronto, Justin Brazeau to Minnesota, Trent Frederic to Edmonton and Charlie Coyle to Colorado. It looked as if they were pulling the plug on a lost season, but beating the playoff-bound Lightning and Panthers back-to-back has Boston right in the thick of the hunt with 68 points and 16 games to play.",
      "Coach Joe Sacco knows the spot his team is in and what just happened. Goaltender Jeremy Swayman, as a result, believes he and his teammates are \u201cgetting hungrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're not giving up on this group,\u201d Swayman said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t be more proud of the guys, the way that their effort is and the way that we\u2019re competing as a team and just being cohesive and we\u2019re obviously getting results.\"",
      "The Montreal Canadiens pulled even with New York and Boston at 68 points by beating the Canucks on Tuesday night. Going into Wednesday's action, the Detroit Red Wings (66 points with 18 games left) are four points out.",
      "While the Canadiens are ahead of schedule in their organizational retooling effort, the Red Wings came up just short a year ago and are in danger of extending the longest playoff drought in franchise history.",
      "Five points back on the very fringe of contention are the New York Islanders (65 points with 18 games left), who have lost seven of 11 and traded pending free agent center Brock Nelson to Colorado on the eve of the trade deadline.",

      "Five years after the death of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash, six members of his Mamba Basketball Academy team are finishing up their first season of college basketball",
      "EVANSTON, Ill. -- On the fifth anniversary of that day \u2014 when the helicopter crashed, and she lost Coach Bryant, his daughter, Gianna, and so much more \u2014 Kat Righeimer became a scholarship player at Northwestern.",
      "The former walk-on, who played for Kobe Bryant with the Mamba Academy, soaked in the moment with her jubilant teammates. The timing, she said, felt like a sign.",
      "\u201cI look at it as like a gift from heaven, kind of from them,\u201d Righeimer said. \u201cJust like them telling me keep going, keep pushing.\u201d",
      "Keep working. Just like Kobe would have wanted.",
      "Righeimer, 18, is one of six women from the Mamba Academy going through their first experience with college basketball. A proud group that learned so much from Bryant \u2014 always Coach Bryant to them \u2014 forever connected by a club team and a tragedy that shook their world.",
      "They are spread throughout the country \u2014 and right beside each other through text messages of love and support. Emily Eadie is at Princeton, and Annika Jiwani plays for Dartmouth. Annabelle Spotts just finished her first season at the University of Chicago. Mackenly Randolph is at Louisville, and Zoie Lamkin plays for Orange Coast College back home in Southern California.",
      "As they moved through their first season of college ball, their conversations with Kobe were a frequent companion.",
      "For Lamkin, it was all about repetition. Finish your breakfast, that\u2019s what Eadie remembers. For Jiwani, it was the value of mistakes. Righeimer and Spotts focused on the mirror, and improving every day.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, did I get better today?\u201d said Spotts, who is interested in working in sports after graduation, possibly on the business side. \u201cAnd if not, fix that tomorrow. ... That\u2019s one thing that always sticks with me.\u201d",
      "Bryant wanted Eadie to clean up her opportunities inside. When the 6-foot forward misses a layup or an easy shot with the Tigers, she often returns to what he used to say.",
      "\u201cIn terms of finishing layups, because that was just something easy,\u201d she said, \u201che was just like always just you can\u2019t leave them on the table. You can\u2019t leave your eggs and bacon on the table. ... Always got to finish your breakfast.\u201d",
      "When Lamkin first joined the Mamba team, she wasn\u2019t very good with her left hand. So Bryant suggested brushing her teeth and turning on the TV with her left hand.",
      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018If you\u2019re struggling with something ... just continue to practice on it,\u2019\u201d said Lamkin, a 5-foot-7 guard who is averaging 13.3 points this season.",
      "Jiwani had the reverse experience. The 6-foot forward was a lefty growing up, so Bryant would tape her left hand behind her back and have her do everything with her right hand. Jiwani remembers Bryant staying after practice to work with her.",
      "She also remembers the value he placed on mistakes as growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just ... that doesn\u2019t even apply to basketball. I think that applies to life for me,\u201d said Jiwani, who hopes to become a doctor someday.",
      "All the players fondly remember the two sides of Gigi \u2014 a fierce competitor on the court, and a lighthearted friend off it.",
      "\u201cShe was very bubbly, I can hear her laugh in my head,\u201d Righeimer said. \u201cShe was always smiling, always cracking jokes. But on the court, it\u2019s like a light switch. She becomes like a beast.\u201d",
      "Eadie called Gigi \"just the hardest worker.\u201d",
      "A lot like her father.",
      "The players described Kobe Bryant as extremely detailed, focusing on the small things. He rarely raised his voice. He \u201cjust wanted to see us figure it out on our own,\u201d Lamkin said.",
      "Righeimer said she doesn\u2019t think they touched a basketball at her first practice with Bryant. They just played defense and ran the whole time.",
      "\u201cHe taught me to play my game, remember what I do best,\u201d Mackenly Randolph said.",
      "The icon part of Bryant\u2019s life \u2014 all the basketball accolades and worldwide notoriety \u2014 that rarely surfaced with the players. For them, he was just coach.",
      "\u201cIt never felt like he was this huge celebrity. But when we would go to these tournaments and all these people would come up and crowd our court, that\u2019s when it felt real,\u201d Eadie said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, this is a big thing.\u2019\u201d",
      "It's only now, when they look back as college players, that they have a better understanding of what they experienced.",
      "\u201cThroughout the whole time that I knew him he was such a global figure, such an influence on the whole game of basketball and everyone who played it,\u201d Spotts said. \u201cI feel like I couldn\u2019t fully appreciate and understand it at such a young age. Where now I could have. It was just kind of a surreal thing the whole time.\u201d",
      "On Jan. 26, 2020, a helicopter carrying Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna \u2014 along with six other passengers and a pilot \u2014 crashed into a hillside in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles. They were traveling to a tournament at Bryant\u2019s Mamba Sports Academy.",
      "Alyssa Altobelli, 14, and Payton Chester, 13 \u2014 two more Mamba teammates \u2014 were among the victims. Assistant coach Christina Mauser, Altobelli\u2019s parents, Keri and John, and Payton\u2019s mother, Sarah, also were on the flight.",
      "At the academy that day, as the players waited for the rest of the team to arrive, there was a growing unease.",
      "Spotts\u2019 father, Jon, got everyone together in a meeting room. The helicopter had crashed, he said. There may have been some fatalities, he continued \u2014 a word that stayed with the players long after that moment, an almost incomprehensible possibility when connected to their friends.",
      "Fatalities.",
      "\u201cI was only, I think 13 at the time,\u201d said Lamkin, who is interested in becoming a nurse after college. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that meant like people might have, you know, passed away. And so I asked my mom, what does that mean? And she told me, and I just remember everybody just like breaking down, crying.\u201d",
      "Fatalities.",
      "\u201cI grew up going to Catholic school,\u201d Righeimer said. \u201cI went to church twice a week, and I prayed a lot, but I don\u2019t remember ever praying as hard as I did that moment. And I remember telling my dad, \u2018What does this mean? What are we going to do?\u2019\u201d",
      "The Mamba Academy team was a group of All-Stars in a local league before it turned into the club team. There were players added along the way, often involving a somewhat dazing encounter with Bryant.",
      "The Mamba parents became friends, too. After the helicopter went down, they had to face their own profound grief alongside their children.",
      "\"I think it was bigger than it being Kobe Bryant for our team and for my family,\" Annika Jiwani said.",

      "SpaceX launched the Spherex observatory from California, putting it on course to fly over Earth\u2019s poles. Tagging along were four suitcase-size satellites to study the sun. Spherex popped off the rocket's upper stage first, drifting into the blackness of space with a blue Earth in the background.",
      "The $488 million Spherex mission aims to explain how galaxies formed and evolved over billions of years, and how the universe expanded so fast in its first moments.",
      "Closer to home in our own Milky Way galaxy, Spherex will hunt for water and other ingredients of life in the icy clouds between stars where new solar systems emerge.",
      "The cone-shaped Spherex \u2014 at 1,110 pounds (500 kilograms) or the heft of a grand piano \u2014 will take six months to map the entire sky with its infrared eyes and wide field of view. Four full-sky surveys are planned over two years, as the telescope circles the globe from pole to pole 400 miles (650 kilometers) up.",
      "Spherex won\u2019t see galaxies in exquisite detail like NASA\u2019s larger and more elaborate Hubble and Webb space telescopes, with their narrow fields of view.",
      "Instead of counting galaxies or focusing on them, Spherex will observe the total glow produced by the whole lot, including the earliest ones formed in the wake of the universe-creating Big Bang.",
      "\u201cThis cosmological glow captures all light emitted over cosmic history,\u201d said the mission\u2019s chief scientist Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different way of looking at the universe,\u201d enabling scientists to see what sources of light may have been missed in the past.",
      "By observing the collective glow, scientists hope to tease out the light from the earliest galaxies and learn how they came to be, Bock said.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t see the Big Bang. But we\u2019ll see the aftermath from it and learn about the beginning of the universe that way,\u201d he said.",

It sports three aluminum-honeycomb cones, one inside the other, to protect from the sun and Earth's heat, resembling a 10-foot (3-meter) shield collar for an ailing dog.",
      "Besides the telescope, SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket provided a lift from Vandenberg Space Force Base for a quartet of NASA satellites called Punch. From their own separate polar orbit, the satellites will observe the sun\u2019s corona, or outer atmosphere, and the resulting solar wind.",

      "Schools are turning to AI-powered surveillance technology to monitor students on school-issued devices like laptops and tablets",
      "One student asked a search engine, \u201cWhy does my boyfriend hit me?\u201d Another threatened suicide in an email to an unrequited love. A gay teen opened up in an online diary about struggles with homophobic parents, writing they just wanted to be themselves.",
      "In each case and thousands of others, surveillance software powered by artificial intelligence immediately alerted Vancouver Public Schools staff in Washington state.",
      "Vancouver and many other districts around the country have turned to technology to monitor school-issued devices 24/7 for any signs of danger as they grapple with a student mental health crisis and the threat of shootings.",
      "The goal is to keep children safe, but these tools raise serious questions about privacy and security \u2014 as proven when Seattle Times and Associated Press reporters inadvertently received access to almost 3,500 sensitive, unredacted student documents through a records request about the district\u2019s surveillance technology.",
      "___",
      "The Education Reporting Collaborative, a coalition of eight newsrooms, is investigating the unintended consequences of AI-powered surveillance at schools. Members of the Collaborative are AL.com, The Associated Press, The Christian Science Monitor, The Dallas Morning News, The Hechinger Report, Idaho Education News, The Post and Courier in South Carolina, and The Seattle Times.",
      "___",
      "The released documents show students use these laptops for more than just schoolwork; they are coping with angst in their personal lives.",
      "Students wrote about depression, heartbreak, suicide, addiction, bullying and eating disorders. There are poems, college essays and excerpts from role-play sessions with AI chatbots.",
      "Vancouver school staff and anyone else with links to the files could read everything. Firewalls or passwords didn\u2019t protect the documents, and student names were not redacted, which cybersecurity experts warned was a massive security risk.",
      "The monitoring tools often helped counselors reach out to students who might have otherwise struggled in silence. But the Vancouver case is a stark reminder of surveillance technology\u2019s unintended consequences in American schools.",
      "In some cases, the technology has outed LGBTQ+ children and eroded trust between students and school staff, while failing to keep schools completely safe.",
      "Gaggle Safety Management, the company that developed the software that tracks Vancouver schools students\u2019 online activity, believes not monitoring children is like letting them loose on \u201ca digital playground without fences or recess monitors,\u201d CEO and founder Jeff Patterson said.",
      "Roughly 1,500 school districts nationwide use Gaggle\u2019s software to track the online activity of approximately 6 million students. It\u2019s one of many companies, like GoGuardian and Securly, that promise to keep kids safe through AI-assisted web surveillance.",
      "The technology has been in high demand since the pandemic, when nearly every child received a school-issued tablet or laptop. According to a U.S. Senate investigation, over 7,000 schools or districts used GoGuardian\u2019s surveillance products in 2021.",
      "Vancouver schools apologized for releasing the documents. Still, the district emphasizes Gaggle is necessary to protect students\u2019 well-being.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we could ever put a price on protecting students,\u201d said Andy Meyer, principal of Vancouver\u2019s Skyview High School. \u201cAnytime we learn of something like that and we can intervene, we feel that is very positive.\u201d",
      "Dacia Foster, a parent in the district, commended the efforts to keep students safe but worries about privacy violations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not good at all,\u201d Foster said after learning the district inadvertently released the records. \u201cBut what are my options? What do I do? Pull my kid out of school?\u201d",
      "Foster says she\u2019d be upset if her daughter\u2019s private information was compromised.",
      "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she said, \u201cI would like to avoid a school shooting or suicide.\u201d",
      "Gaggle uses a machine-learning algorithm to scan what students search or write online via a school-issued laptop or tablet 24 hours a day, or whenever they log into their school account on a personal device. The latest contract Vancouver signed, in summer 2024, shows a price of $328,036 for three school years \u2014 approximately the cost of employing one extra counselor.",
      "The algorithm detects potential indicators of problems like bullying, self-harm, suicide or school violence and then sends a screenshot to human reviewers. If Gaggle employees confirm the issue might be serious, the company alerts the school. In cases of imminent danger, Gaggle calls school officials directly. In rare instances where no one answers, Gaggle may contact law enforcement for a welfare check.",
      "A Vancouver school counselor who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said they receive three or four student Gaggle alerts per month. In about half the cases, the district contacts parents immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, families don\u2019t know. We open that door for that help,\u201d the counselor said. Gaggle is \u201cgood for catching suicide and self-harm, but students find a workaround once they know they are getting flagged.\u201d",
      "Seattle Times and AP reporters saw what kind of writing set off Gaggle\u2019s alerts after requesting information about the type of content flagged. Gaggle saved screenshots of activity that set off each alert, and school officials accidentally provided links to them, not realizing they weren\u2019t protected by a password.",
      "After learning about the records inadvertently released to reporters, Gaggle updated its system. Now, after 72 hours, only those logged into a Gaggle account can view the screenshots. Gaggle said this feature was already in the works but had not yet been rolled out to every customer.",
      "The company says the links must be accessible without a login during those 72 hours so emergency contacts \u2014 who often receive these alerts late at night on their phones \u2014 can respond quickly.",
      "In Vancouver, the monitoring technology flagged more than 1,000 documents for suicide and nearly 800 for threats of violence. While many alerts were serious, many others turned out to be false alarms, like a student essay about the importance of consent or a goofy chat between friends.",
      "Foster\u2019s daughter Bryn, a Vancouver School of Arts and Academics sophomore, was one such false alarm. She was called into the principal\u2019s office after writing a short story featuring a scene with mildly violent imagery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being safe about it, but I also think it can be a bit much,\u201d Bryn said.",
      "School officials maintain alerts are warranted even in less severe cases or false alarms, ensuring potential issues are addressed promptly.",
      "\u201cIt allows me the opportunity to meet with a student I maybe haven\u2019t met before and build that relationship,\u201d said Chele Pierce, a Skyview High School counselor.",
      "Between October 2023 and October 2024, nearly 2,200 students, about 10% of the district\u2019s enrollment, were the subject of a Gaggle alert. At the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, where Bryn is a student, about 1 in 4 students had communications that triggered a Gaggle alert.",
      "While schools continue to use surveillance technology, its long-term effects on student safety are unclear. There\u2019s no independent research showing it measurably lowers student suicide rates or reduces violence.",
      "A 2023 RAND study found only \u201cscant evidence\u201d of either benefits or risks from AI surveillance, concluding: \u201cNo research to date has comprehensively examined how these programs affect youth suicide prevention.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the right number of mental health counselors, issuing more alerts is not actually going to improve suicide prevention,\u201d said report co-author Benjamin Boudreaux, an AI ethics researcher.",
      "In the screenshots released by Vancouver schools, at least six students were potentially outed to school officials after writing about being gay, transgender or struggling with gender dysphoria.",
      "LGBTQ+ students are more likely than their peers to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and turn to the internet for support.",
      "\u201cWe know that gay youth, especially those in more isolated environments, absolutely use the internet as a life preserver,\u201d said Katy Pearce, a University of Washington professor who researches technology in authoritarian states.",
      "In one screenshot, a Vancouver high schooler wrote in a Google survey form they\u2019d been subject to trans slurs and racist bullying. Who created this survey is unclear, but the person behind it had falsely promised confidentiality: \u201cI am not a mandated reporter, please tell me the whole truth.\u201d",
      "When North Carolina\u2019s Durham Public Schools piloted Gaggle in 2021, surveys showed most staff members found it helpful.",
      "But community members raised concerns. An LGBTQ+ advocate reported to the Board of Education that a Gaggle alert about self-harm had led to a student being outed to their family, who were not supportive.",
      "Glenn Thompson, a Durham School of the Arts graduate, spoke up at a board meeting during his senior year. One of his teachers promised a student confidentiality for an assignment related to mental health. A classmate was then \u201cblindsided\u201d when Gaggle alerted school officials about something private they\u2019d disclosed. Thompson said no one in the class, including the teacher, knew the school was piloting Gaggle.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just (surveil) people and not tell them. That\u2019s a horrible breach of security and trust,\u201d said Thompson, now a college student, in an interview.",
      "After hearing about these experiences, the Durham Board of Education voted to stop using Gaggle in 2023. The district ultimately decided it was not worth the risk of outing students or eroding relationships with adults.",
      "The debate over privacy and security is complicated, and parents are often unaware it\u2019s even an issue. Pearce, the University of Washington professor, doesn\u2019t remember reading about Securly, the surveillance software Seattle Public Schools uses, when she signed the district\u2019s responsible use form before her son received a school laptop.",
      "Even when families learn about school surveillance, they may be unable to opt out. Owasso Public Schools in Oklahoma has used Gaggle since 2016 to monitor students outside of class.",
      "For years, Tim Reiland, the parent of two teenagers, had no idea the district was using Gaggle. He found out only after asking if his daughter could bring her personal laptop to school instead of being forced to use a district one because of privacy concerns.",
      "The district refused Reiland\u2019s request.",
      "When Reiland's daughter, Zoe, found out about Gaggle, she says she felt so \u201cfreaked out\u201d that she stopped Googling anything personal on her Chromebook, even questions about her menstrual period. She didn\u2019t want to get called into the office for \u201csearching up lady parts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was too scared to be curious,\u201d she said.",
      "School officials say they don\u2019t track metrics measuring the technology\u2019s efficacy but believe it has saved lives.",
      "Yet technology alone doesn\u2019t create a safe space for all students. In 2024, a nonbinary teenager at Owasso High School named Nex Benedict died by suicide after relentless bullying from classmates. A subsequent U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights investigation found the district responded with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to some families\u2019 reports of sexual harassment, mainly in the form of homophobic bullying.",
      "During the 2023-24 school year, the Owasso schools received close to 1,000 Gaggle alerts, including 168 alerts for harassment and 281 for suicide.",
      "When asked why bullying remained a problem despite surveillance, Russell Thornton, the district\u2019s executive director of technology responded: \u201cThis is one tool used by administrators. Obviously, one tool is not going to solve the world\u2019s problems and bullying.\u201d",
      "Despite the risks, surveillance technology can help teachers intervene before a tragedy.",
      "A middle school student in the Seattle-area Highline School District who was potentially being trafficked used Gaggle to communicate with campus staff, said former Superintendent Susan Enfield.",
      "\u201cThey knew that the staff member was reading what they were writing,\u201d Enfield said. \u201cIt was, in essence, that student\u2019s way of asking for help.\u201d",
      "Still, developmental psychology research shows it is vital for teens to have private spaces online to explore their thoughts and seek support.",
      "\u201cThe idea that kids are constantly under surveillance by adults \u2014 I think that would make it hard to develop a private life, a space to make mistakes, a space to go through hard feelings without adults jumping in,\u201d said Boudreaux, the AI ethics researcher.",
      "Gaggle\u2019s Patterson says school-issued devices are not the appropriate place for unlimited self-exploration. If that exploration takes a dark turn, such as making a threat, \u201cthe school\u2019s going to be held liable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for that open free expression, it really can\u2019t happen on the school system\u2019s computers.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A fossil of a partial face from a human ancestor is the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday.",
      "The incomplete skull \u2014 a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw \u2013 was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to research published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThe fossil is exciting,\" said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt's the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.\u201d",
      "A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors was previously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old.",
      "The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors \u201cwere taking excursions into Europe\u201d at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program.",
      "But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. \u201cThey may get to a new location and then die out,\u201d said Potts, who had no role in the study.",
      "The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.",
      "Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts.",
      "It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there's only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The same cave complex in Spain's Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past. Researchers working in the region have also found more recent fossils from Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese automaker Nissan says its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automaker Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is stepping down after the company reported dismal financial results and its merger talks with Honda collapsed.",
      "Nissan Motor Corp. said in a statement Tuesday that Ivan Espinosa, who is now the company\u2019s chief planning officer, will take Uchida\u2019s place, effective April 1.",
      "Nissan stock edged up slightly at the opening but soon slipped about 1% in early Wednesday trading in Tokyo, highlighting investors' skepticism over what was announced late the previous day.",
      "Espinosa, who joined Nissan in 2003, has spent much of his Nissan career in Mexico and Southeast Asia, overseeing product planning including the drive toward electric vehicles, meaning he's an insider perhaps less willing to take drastic action.",
      "\u201cI sincerely believe that Nissan has so much more potential than what we're seeing today,\u201d Espinosa told reporters, while stressing that he needs time to come up with details for a turnaround.",
      "He stressed his love for Nissan, noting he has developed a deep understanding of what makes the company unique and valuable.",
      "Nissan said the company leadership needed to be \u201crenewed\u201d to achieve long-term growth. Uchida, who remains as a director, expressed confidence in Espinosa as \u201ca real car guy,\u201d and stressed he was handing over the baton of leadership to better unify company ranks.",
      "\u201cI am confident that Nissan will definitely make a comeback,\u201d he said, appearing at the hastily called news conference with Espinosa.",
      "Speculation about Uchida's future was rife after he called off talks last month with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co., announced late last year, to set up a joint holding company to integrate their businesses. At the time, he told reporters the focus of the talks had changed to making Nissan into a Honda subsidiary, which he denounced as unacceptable.",
      "He also said their strategic partnership to realize synergies on specific projects like electric vehicles and other research will continue.",
      "Nissan is projecting a loss of 80 billion yen ($540 million) for the full fiscal year through the end of this month.",
      "When asked about talks with Honda and other possible partnerships, Espinosa declined comment, saying he needed more time.",
      "During Uchida\u2019s more than five years at Nissan\u2019s helm, sales faltered, including in key markets like the U.S. and China. Uchida also earlier announced the company was slashing 9,000 jobs.",
      "Analysts said Nissan's future remains precarious, with little time left, but noted Nissan may need an outsider rather than an insider like Espinosa.",
      "Todd Duvick and Will Lee, auto analysts at CreditSights, believe the focus is still on a business turnaround, not the proposed integration with Honda.",
      "\u201cNot that a turnaround could not coexist with a Honda merger, but we view it as unlikely that Nissan would be open to becoming a subsidiary of Honda at this time, at least until the board has time to assess the effectiveness of Espinosa\u2019s strategy once it is unveiled and put into action,\u201d they said in a report.",
      "It\u2019s a sad turn for the maker of the Z sportscar, loved by auto buffs around the world, and the Leaf electric car, a pioneer in that sector that launched in 2010. Besides its proud legacy, Nissan also boasts solid engineering. It recently showed off its autonomous vehicle running on regular streets near its Yokohama headquarters.",
      "Uchida joined Nissan in 2003, job-hopping from major Japanese trading company Nissho Iwai, and worked with Nissan\u2019s alliance partner Renault SA of France before overseeing Nissan\u2019s China operations.",
      "Nissan was rescued from near bankruptcy by Renault in 1999. In 2018, Carlos Ghosn, the former superstar executive sent in by Renault, was arrested by Japanese authorities on various financial misconduct charges, including under-reporting his compensation. He later fled to Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan.",
      "Nissan's tarnished corporate image after the Ghosn fiasco was a major challenge, Uchida said. So were the COVID-19 pandemic and broader shifts in the auto industry.",
      "Apart from Uchida's departure as chief executive, Nissan announced other sweeping managerial changes, including giving an expanded role to Guillaume Cartier, its chief performance officer, in global marketing and customer experience.",
      "Eiichi Akashi, corporate vice president of the Vehicle Planning and Vehicle Component Engineering Division, was named chief technology officer, succeeding Kunio Nakaguro.",
      "Teiji Hirata, a corporate vice president, will become chief \u201cmonozukuri\u201d officer and executive officer, responsible for manufacturing and supply chain management, replacing Hideyuki Sakamoto.",
      "Jeremy Papin, the chief financial officer, was also appointed to be an executive officer. There was no change for Stephen Ma, who serves as chairperson of Nissan's management committee in China.",

      "In less than a month, TikTok could have one or a few new owners, be banned again, or simply receive another reprieve to continue operating in the United States.",
      "Questions about the fate of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.",
      "As he returned to Washington from his Florida home on Sunday, Trump told reporters that a deal could come soon. He did not offer any details on the interested buyers, but said the administration was in talks with \u201cfour different groups\u201d about TikTok.",
      "\u201cA lot of people want it and it\u2019s up to me,\u201d Trump said aboard Air Force One.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "If TikTok is not sold to an approved buyer by April 5, the original law that bans it nationwide would once again go into effect. However, the deadline for the executive order doesn't appear to be set in stone and the president has reiterated it could be extended further if needed.",
      "Trump\u2019s order came a few days after the Supreme Court unanimously upheld a federal law that required TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to divest or be banned in January. The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users and came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "During his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok on national security grounds, which was halted by the courts before his administration negotiated a sale of the platform that eventually failed to materialize. He changed his position on the popular app during last year's presidential election and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters.",
      "The decision to keep TikTok alive through an executive order has received some scrutiny, but it has not faced a legal challenge in court.",
      "Although it\u2019s unclear if ByteDance plans to sell TikTok, several potential bidders have come forward in the past few months.",
      "Aides for Vice President JD Vance, who was tapped to oversee a potential deal, have reached out to some parties, such as the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, to get additional details about their bids, according to a person familiar with the matter. In January, Perplexity AI presented ByteDance with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation.",
      "Other potential bidders include a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic advisor. Investors in the consortium say they\u2019ve offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. And if successful, they plan to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they say will provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, says he too has organized a consortium, which includes the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and is offering ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",
      "Trump said in January that Microsoft was also eyeing the popular app. Other interested parties include Trump\u2019s former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin and Rumble, the video site popular with some conservatives and far-right groups. In a post on X last March, Rumble said it was ready to join a consortium of parties interested in purchasing TikTok and serving as a tech partner for the company.",
      "Trump has said he is looking to have the U.S. government broker a deal for 50% control of TikTok. However, the administration hasn't provided details on what exactly that would entail, or what role the U.S. government could play in the future of the short-form video app.",
      "Some potential bidders have floated proposals that would allow the U.S. to invest or own a stake in the platform. Last month, Trump himself also said the U.S. could own part of TikTok through a new government-owned investment fund.",
      "Chinese officials, who would have to approve the deal, appear to have softened their stance on the issue compared to last year when Beijing called the push for divestment a \u201crobbers\u201d act.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in January that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "If ByteDance sits down to negotiate, the company would likely need to iron out major details with the U.S. over the proprietary algorithm that populates TikTok feeds as well as the flow of content between the U.S. and the rest of the world.",

      "Explorers have discovered the sunken wreckage of one of the first steel cargo ships to travel the Great Lakes",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Twenty years before the Titanic changed maritime history, another ship touted as the next great technological feat set sail on the Great Lakes.",
      "The Western Reserve was one of the first all-steel cargo ships to traverse the lakes. Built to break speed records, the 300-foot (91.4-meter) freighter dubbed \u201cthe inland greyhound\u201d by newspapers was supposed to be one of the safest ships afloat. Owner Peter Minch was so proud of her that he brought his wife and young children aboard for a summer joyride in August 1892.",
      "Then tragedy struck. As the ship entered Lake Superior's Whitefish Bay between Michigan and Canada on Aug. 30, a gale came up. With no cargo aboard, the ship was light and floating high in the water. The storm battered it until it cracked in half. Twenty-seven people perished that night, including the Minch family. The only survivor was wheelsman Harry W. Stewart, who swam a mile (1.6 kilometers) to shore after his lifeboat capsized.",
      "For almost 132 years the lake hid the wreckage. In July, explorers from the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society pinpointed the Western Reserve off Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The society announced the discovery Saturday at the annual Ghost Ships Festival in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Executive Director Bruce Lynn called the discovery one of the society's most significant finds.",
      "\u201cThere's a number of concurrent stories that make this important,\u201d Lynn said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cMost ships were still wooden. It was a technologically advanced ship. They were kind of a famous family at the time. You have this new ship, considered one of the safest on the lake, new tech, a big, big ship. (The discovery) is another way for us to keep this history alive.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel, the society's marine operations director, and his brother, Dan Ertel, spent more than two years looking for the Western Reserve.",
      "Lynn said this winter the brothers outlined a search grid. On July 22 they set out on the David Boyd, the society's research vessel. Heavy ship traffic that day forced them to alter their course, though, and search an area adjacent to their original grid, Lynn said.",
      "The brothers towed a side-scanning sonar array behind their ship. Side sonar scans to starboard and port, providing a more expansive picture of the bottom than traditional sonar mounted beneath a ship. About 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Whitefish Point on the Upper Peninsula, they picked up a line with a shadow behind it in 600 feet of water. They dialed up the resolution and spotted a ship broken in two with the bow resting on the stern. Each section was 150 feet (45.2 meters) long, suggesting they'd found the Western Reserve.",
      "Eight days later, the brothers returned to the site along with Lynn. They deployed a submersible drone equipped with high-intensity lighting and a high-resolution camera. The drone returned clear images of a portside running light that match the Western Reserve's starboard running light, which had washed ashore in Canada after the ship went down. That light was the only artifact recovered from the ship.",
      "\u201cThat was confirmation day,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cIt's pretty exciting.\u201d",
      "Darryl Ertel said that discovery gave him chills \u2014 and not in a good way. \u201cKnowing how the 300-foot Western Reserve was caught in a storm this far from shore made a uneasy feeling in the back of my neck,\" he said in a society news release. \"A squall can come up unexpectedly\u2026anywhere, and anytime.\u201d",
      "The Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that went down in a November 1975 storm that was immortalized in the Gordon Lightfoot song, \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\" sank off Whitefish Point within 100 miles of the Western Reserve. There were no survivors."

      "OKUMA, Japan -- The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.",
      "It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection \u2014 full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.",
      "As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.",
      "The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.",
      "A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor.",
      "That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.",
      "Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.",
      "A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks.",
      "Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2.",
      "Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.",
      "In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.",
      "\u201cWorking under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,\" said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. \"It was a difficult assignment.\u201d",
      "Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.",
      "To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.",
      "The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order.",
      "A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.",
      "The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit.",
      "Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers.",
      "In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.",
      "Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.",
      "On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.",
      "At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.",
      "To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.",
      "Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.",
      "After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.",
      "Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.",
      "Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home.",
      "\u201cAs a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,\u201d he said."

      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When artificial intelligence-backed tractors became available to vineyards, Tom Gamble wanted to be an early adopter. He knew there would be a learning curve, but Gamble decided the technology was worth figuring out.",
      "The third-generation farmer bought one autonomous tractor. He plans on deploying its self-driving feature this spring and is currently using the tractor's AI sensor to map his Napa Valley vineyard. As it learns each row, the tractor will know where to go once it is used autonomously. The AI within the machine will then process the data it collects and help Gamble make better-informed decisions about his crops \u2014 what he calls \u201cprecision farming.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to completely replace the human element of putting your boot into the vineyard, and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be able to allow you to work more smartly, more intelligently and in the end, make better decisions under less fatigue.\u201d",
      "Gamble said he anticipates using the tech as much as possible because of \u201ceconomic, air quality and regulatory imperatives.\u201d Autonomous tractors, he said, could help lower his fuel use and cut back on pollution.",
      "As AI continues to grow, experts say that the wine industry is proof that businesses can integrate the technology efficiently to supplement labor without displacing a workforce. New agricultural tech like AI can help farmers to cut back on waste, and to run more efficient and sustainable vineyards by monitoring water use and helping determine when and where to use products like fertilizers or pest control. AI-backed tractors and irrigation systems, farmer say, can minimize water use by analyzing soil or vines, while also helping farmers to manage acres of vineyards by providing more accurate data on the health of a crop or what a season\u2019s yield will be.",
      "Other facets of the wine industry have also started adopting the tech, from using generative AI to create custom wine labels to turning to ChatGPT to develop, label and price an entire bottle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anybody losing their job, because I think that a tractor operator\u2019s skills are going to increase and as a result, and maybe they\u2019re overseeing a small fleet of these machines that are out there, and they\u2019ll be compensated as a result of their increased skill level,\u201d he said.",
      "Farmers, Gamble said, are always evolving. There were fears when the tractor replaced horses and mules pulling plows, but that technology \u201cproved itself\u201d just like AI farming tech will, he said, adding that adopting any new tech always takes time.",
      "Companies like John Deere have started using the AI that wine farmers are beginning to adopt. The agricultural giant uses \u201cSmart Apply\u201d technology on tractors, for example, helping growers apply material for crop retention by using sensors and algorithms to sense foliage on grape canopies, said Sean Sundberg, business integration manager at John Deere.",
      "The tractors that use that tech then only spray \u201cwhere there are grapes or leaves or whatnot so that it doesn\u2019t spray material unnecessarily,\u201d he said. Last year, the company announced a project with Sonoma County Winegrowers to use tech to help wine grape growers maximize their yield.",
      "Tyler Klick, partner at Redwood Empire Vineyard Management, said his company has started automating irrigation valves at the vineyards it helps manage. The valves send an alert in the event of a leak and will automatically shut off if they notice an \u201cexcessive\u201d water flow rate.",
      "\u201cThat valve is actually starting to learn typical water use,\u201d Klick said. \u201cIt\u2019ll learn how much water is used before the production starts to fall off.\u201d",
      "Klick said each valve costs roughly $600, plus $150 per acre each year to subscribe to the service.",
      "\u201cOur job, viticulture, is to adjust our operations to the climatic conditions we\u2019re dealt,\u201d Klick said. \u201cI can see AI helping us with finite conditions.\u201d",
      "Angelo A. Camillo, a professor of wine business at Sonoma State University, said that despite excitement over AI in the wine industry, some smaller vineyards are more skeptical about their ability to use the technology. Small, family-owned operations, which Camillo said account for about 80% of the wine business in America, are slowly disappearing \u2014 many don\u2019t have the money to invest in AI, he said. A robotic arm that helps put together pallets of wine, for example, can cost as much as $150,000, he said.",
      "\u201cFor small wineries, there\u2019s a question mark, which is the investment. Then there\u2019s the education. Who\u2019s going to work with all of these AI applications? Where is the training?\u201d he said.",
      "There are also potential challenges with scalability, Camillo added. Drones, for example, could be useful for smaller vineyards that could use AI to target specific crops that have a bug problem, he said \u2014 it would be much harder to operate 100 drones in a 1,000 acre vineyard while also employing the IT workers who understand the tech.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think a person can manage 40 drones as a swarm of drones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a constraint for the operators to adopt certain things.\u201d",
      "However, AI is particularly good at tracking a crop\u2019s health \u2013 including how the plant itself is doing and whether it\u2019s growing enough leaves \u2013 while also monitoring grapes to aid in yield projections, said Mason Earles, an assistant professor who leads the Plant AI and Biophysics Lab at UC Davis.",
      "Diseases or viruses can sneak up and destroy entire vineyards, Earles said, calling it an \u201celephant in the room\u201d across the wine industry. The process of replanting a vineyard and getting it to produce well takes at least five years, he said. AI can help growers determine which virus is affecting their plants, he said, and whether they should rip out some crops immediately to avoid losing their entire vineyard.",
      "Earles, who is also cofounder of the AI-powered farm management platform Scout, said his company uses AI to process thousands of images in hours and extract data quickly \u2014 something that would be difficult by hand in large vineyards that span hundreds of acres. Scout's AI platform then counts and measures the number of grape clusters as early as when a plant is beginning to flower in order to forecast what a yield will be.",
      "The sooner vintners know how much yield to expect, the better they can \u201cdial in\u201d their wine making process, he added.",
      "\u201cPredicting what yields you\u2019re going to have at the end of the season, no one is that good at it right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really important because it determines how much labor contract you\u2019re going to need and the supplies you\u2019ll need for making wine.\u201d",
      "Earles doesn\u2019t think the budding use of AI in vineyards is \u201cfreaking farmers out.\u201d Rather, he anticipates that AI will be used more frequently to help with difficult field labor and to discern problems in vineyards that farmers need help with.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve seen people trying to sell them tech for decades. It\u2019s hard to farm; it\u2019s unpredictable compared to most other jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe walking and counting, I think people would have said a long time ago, \u2018I would happily let a machine take over.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers urge the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests in coming decades",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday urged the Trump administration to scrap plans to kill more than 450,000 invasive barred owls in West Coast forests as part of efforts to stop the birds from crowding out a smaller type of owl that's facing potential extinction.",
      "The 19 lawmakers \u2014 led by Republican Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas conservative, and Democrat Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California liberal \u2014 claimed the killings would be \u201cgrossly expensive\u201d and cost $3,000 per bird.",
      "They questioned if the shootings would help native populations of northern spotted owls, which have long been controversial because of logging restrictions in the birds' forest habitat beginning in the 1990s, and the closely related California spotted owl.",
      "Barred owls are native to eastern North America and started appearing in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s. They\u2019ve quickly displaced many spotted owls, which are smaller birds that need larger territories to breed.",
      "An estimated 100,000 barred owls now live within a range that contains only about 7,100 spotted owls, according to federal officials.",
      "Under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan approved last year, trained shooters would target barred owls over 30 years across a maximum of about 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) in California, Oregon and Washington.",
      "The plan did not include a cost estimate. But the lawmakers said in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum that it could top $1.3 billion based on extrapolating costs from a grant awarded to the the Hoopa Valley Native American Tribe in California to kill up to 1,500 barred owls.",
      "\u201cThis is an inappropriate and inefficient use of U.S. taxpayer dollars,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \"This latest plan is an example of our federal government attempting to supersede nature and control environmental outcomes at great cost.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson did not immediately respond to questions about the cost estimate and the owl removal program. The agency's plan called for more than 2,400 barred owls to be removed this year and for that number to ramp up to more than 15,500 birds annually beginning in 2027.",
      "Scientists for years have been shooting barred owls on an experimental basis and officials say the results show the strategy could halt spotted owl declines. As of last year, about 4,500 barred owls were killed on the West Coast by researchers since 2009.",
      "Killing one bird species to save others has divided wildlife advocates and is reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants. Or when, to preserve warblers, cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests were killed. The barred owl removals would be among the largest such effort to date involving birds of prey, researchers and wildlife advocates said.",
      "Barred owls arrived in the Pacific Northwest via the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold, or via Canada\u2019s boreal forests, which have become warmer and more hospitable as the climate changes, researchers said.",
      "Their spread has undermined decades of spotted owl restoration efforts that previously focused on protecting forests where they live. That included logging restrictions under former President Bill Clinton that ignited bitter political fights and temporarily helped slow the spotted owl\u2019s decline.",

      "Nissan Motor Corp. recently showcased its driverless technology on city streets in Yokohama",
      "YOKOHAMA, Japan -- The van makes its way slowly but surely through the city streets, braking gently when a car swerves into its lane. But its steering wheel is turning on its own, and there's no one in the driver\u2019s seat.",
      "The driverless technology from Nissan Motor Corp., which uses 14 cameras, nine radars and six LiDar sensors installed in and around the vehicle, highlights Japan's eagerness to catch up with players like Google\u2019s Waymo that have taken the lead in the U.S.",
      "Japan, home to the world\u2019s top automakers, has not kept pace with the global shift to autonomous driving, so far led by China and the U.S. But momentum is building.",
      "Waymo is going to land in Japan this year. Details haven't been disclosed, but it has a partnership with major cab company Nihon Kotsu, which will oversee and manage their all-electric Jaguar I-PACE sport-utility vehicles, first in the Tokyo area, still with a human cab driver riding along.",
      "During Nissan's demonstration, the streets were bustling with other cars and pedestrians. The vehicle stayed within the maximum speed limit in the area of 40 kph (25 mph), its destination set with a smartphone app.",
      "Takeshi Kimura, the Mobility and AI Laboratory engineer at Nissan, insists an automaker is more adept at integrating self-driving technology with the overall workings of a car \u2014 simply because it knows cars better.",
      "\u201cHow the sensors must be adapted to the car\u2019s movements, or to monitor sensors and computers to ensure reliability and safety requires an understanding of the auto system overall,\u201d he said during a recent demonstration that took reporters on a brief ride.",
      "Nissan\u2019s technology, being tested on its Serena minivan, is still technically at the industry's Level Two because a person sits before a remote-control panel in a separate location outside the vehicle, in this case, at the automaker's headquarters, and is ready to step in if the technology fails.",
      "Nissan also has a human sitting in the front passenger seat during the test rides, who can take over the driving, if needed. Unless there is a problem, the people in the remote control room and the passenger seat are doing nothing.",
      "Nissan plans to have 20 such vehicles moving in the Yokohama area in the next couple of years, with the plan to reach Level Four, which means no human involvement even as backup, by 2029 or 2030.",
      "Autonomous vehicles can serve a real need given the nation\u2019s shrinking population, including a shortage of drivers.",
      "Other companies are working on the technology in Japan, including startups like Tier IV, which is pushing an open source collaboration on autonomous driving technology.",
      "So far, Japan has approved the use of so-called Level Four autonomous vehicles in a rural area in Fukui Prefecture, but those look more like golf carts. A Level Four bus is scuttling around a limited area near Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. But its maximum speed is 12 kmph (7.5 mph). Nissan's autonomous vehicle is a real car, capable of all its mechanical workings and speed levels.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp. recently showed its very own \u201ccity\u201d or living area for its workers and partnering startups, near Mount Fuji, being built especially to test various technology, including autonomous driving.",
      "Progress has been cautious.",
      "University of Tokyo Professor Takeo Igarashi, who specializes in computer and information technology, believes challenges remain because it\u2019s human nature to be more alarmed by accidents with driverless vehicles than regular crashes.",
      "\u201cIn human driving, the driver takes responsibility. It\u2019s so clear. But nobody is driving so you don\u2019t know who will take responsibility,\u201d Igarashi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn Japan, the expectation for commercial services is very high. The customer expects perfect quality for any service \u2014 restaurants or drivers or anything. This kind of auto-driving is a service form a company, and everybody expects high quality and perfection. Even a small mistake is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Nissan says its technology is safe. After all, a human can\u2019t be looking at the front, the back and all around at the same time. But the driverless car can, with all its sensors.",
      "When a system failure happened during the recent demonstration, the car just came to a stop and all was well.",
      "Phil Koopman, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, believes the autonomous vehicle industry is just getting started.",
      "The main problem is what\u2019s known as \u201cedge cases,\u201d those rare but dangerous situations that the machine has not yet been taught to respond to. Using autonomous fleets of a significant size for some time is needed for such edge cases to be learned, he said.",
      "\u201cWe will see each city require special engineering efforts and the creation of a special remote support center. This will be a city-by-city deployment for many years,\u201d said Koopman.",

      "WASHINGTON -- America's butterflies are disappearing because of insecticides, climate change and habitat loss, with the number of the winged beauties down 22% since 2000, a new study finds.",
      "The first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday's journal Science.",
      "\u201cButterflies have been declining the last 20 years,\u201d said study co-author Nick Haddad, an entomologist at Michigan State University. \u201cAnd we don't see any sign that that's going to end.\"",
      "A team of scientists combined 76,957 surveys from 35 monitoring programs and blended them for an apples-to-apples comparison and ended up counting 12.6 million butterflies over the decades. Last month an annual survey that looked just at monarch butterflies, which federal officials plan to put on the threatened species list, counted a nearly all-time low of fewer than 10,000, down from 1.2 million in 1997.",
      "Many of the species in decline fell by 40% or more.",
      "David Wagner, a University of Connecticut entomologist who wasn't part of the study, praised its scope. And he said while the annual rate of decline may not sound significant, it is \u201ccatastrophic and saddening\u201d when compounded over time.",
      "\u201cIn just 30 or 40 years we are talking about losing half the butterflies (and other insect life) over a continent!\u201d Wagner said in an email. \"The tree of life is being denuded at unprecedented rates.\u201d",
      "The United States has 650 butterfly species, but 96 species were so sparse they didn't show up in the data and another 212 species weren't found in sufficient number to calculate trends, said study lead author Collin Edwards, an ecologist and data scientist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\u201cI'm probably most worried about the species that couldn't even be included in the analyses\u201d because they were so rare, said University of Wisconsin-Madison entomologist Karen Oberhauser, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Haddad, who specializes in rare butterflies, said in recent years he has seen just two endangered St. Francis Satyr butterflies \u2014 which only live on a bomb range at Fort Bragg in North Carolina \u2014 \u201cso it could be extinct.\u201d",
      "Some well-known species had large drops. The red admiral, which is so calm it lands on people, is down 44% and the American lady butterfly, with two large eyespots on its back wings, decreased by 58%, Edwards said.",
      "Even the invasive white cabbage butterfly, \u201ca species that is well adapted to invade the world,\" according to Haddad, fell by 50%.",
      "\"How can that be?\u201d Haddad wondered.",
      "Cornell University butterfly expert Anurag Agrawal said he worries most about the future of a different species: Humans.",
      "\u201cThe loss of butterflies, parrots and porpoises is undoubtedly a bad sign for us, the ecosystems we need and the nature we enjoy,\u201d Agrawal, who wasn't part of the study, said in an email. \u201cThey are telling us that our continent's health is not doing so well ... Butterflies are an ambassador for nature's beauty, fragility and the interdependence of species. They have something to teach us.\u201d",
      "Oberhauser said butterflies connect people with nature and that \u201ccalms us down, makes us healthier and happier and promotes learning.\u201d",
      "What's happening to butterflies in the United States is probably happening to other, less-studied insects across the continent and world, Wagner said. He said not only is this the most comprehensive butterfly study, but the most data-rich for any insect.",
      "Butterflies are also pollinators, though not as prominent as bees, and are a major source of pollination of the Texas cotton crop, Haddad said.",
      "The biggest decrease in butterflies was in the Southwest \u2014 Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma \u2014 where the number of butterflies dropped by more than half in the 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the butterflies that are in dry and warm areas are doing particularly poorly,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd that kind of captures a lot of the Southwest.\u201d",
      "Edwards said when they looked at butterfly species that lived both in the hotter South and cooler North, the ones that did better were in the cooler areas.",
      "Climate change, habitat loss and insecticides tend to work together to weaken butterfly populations, Edwards and Haddad said. Of the three, it seems that insecticides are the biggest cause, based on previous research from the U.S. Midwest, Haddad said.",
      "\u201cIt makes sense because insecticide use has changed in dramatic ways in the time since our study started,\u201d Haddad said.",
      "Habitats can be restored and so can butterflies, so there's hope, Haddad said.",

In my review, I wrote that \u201cthe warm Polynesian spirit and open-sea sense of adventure is back in \u2018Moana 2,\u2019 but little of the original\u2019s humor or catchy songs finds its way into this heartfelt but lackluster sequel.\u201d",

      "The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City, rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The number of monarch butterflies wintering in the mountains west of Mexico City rebounded this year, doubling the area they covered in 2024 despite the stresses of climate change and habitat loss, experts said Thursday.",
      "The annual butterfly count doesn\u2019t calculate the individual number of butterflies, but rather the number of acres they cover as they gather on tree branches in the mountain pine and fir forests. Monarchs from east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada overwinter there.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Commission for National Protected Areas (CONANP) said that this year, butterflies covered 4.4 acres (1.79 hectares) compared to only 2.2 acres (0.9 hectares) the year before. Last year\u2019s figure represented a 59% drop from 2023, the second lowest level since record keeping began.",
      "After wintering in Mexico, the iconic butterflies with black and orange wings fly north, breeding multiple generations along the way for thousands of miles. The offspring that reach southern Canada begin the trip back to Mexico at the end of summer.",
      "Gloria Tavera Alonso, the Mexican agency\u2019s director general of conservation, said the improved numbers owed to better climatic factors and humidity. Drought along the butterflies\u2019 migratory route had been listed as a factor in last year\u2019s decline.",
      "The impact of changes in weather year after year mean fluctuations are expected. For that, Jorge Rickards, Mexico director general for the World Wildlife Fund, said \u201cyou can't let down your guard\u201d and must continue to expand conservation efforts.",
      "Tavera Alonso credited ongoing efforts to increase the number of plants the butterflies rely on for sustenance and reproduction along their flyway.",
      "Butterflies have not been faring well north of the border.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations of monarch butterflies \u2014 a separate population from those that winter in central Mexico \u2014 along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced in February that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997.",
      "And the first countrywide systematic analysis of butterfly abundance in the United States found that the number of butterflies in the Lower 48 states has been falling on average 1.3% a year since the turn of the century, with 114 species showing significant declines and only nine increasing, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal Science.",
      "Experts say that monarchs face risks across North America in large part due to the reduction in milkweed where the monarchs lay their eggs. The plant has been disappearing due to drought, wildfires, herbicides and urbanization.",
      "In December, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed that monarch butterflies receive protection as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.",

      "Meanwhile, they've not publicly demanded any concessions from Putin -- and it's not clear how far Trump is willing to go in pressuring Russia to accept the 30-day ceasefire.",
      "\"We can, but I hope it's not going to be necessary,\" Trump said on Wednesday when asked about that very issue.",
      "\"There are things you could do that wouldn't be pleasant in a financial sense,\" he added without divulging any specifics. \"I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia. I don't want to do that because I want to get peace.\"",

      "The Department of Education's mass layoffs on Tuesday affected some 1,315 employees -- including civil servants around the country who are now left wondering who will advocate for those they served.",
      "The cuts -- which account for a nearly 50% reduction at the department -- impacted every part of the Department of Education, according to senior education department officials.",
      "But a source familiar tells ABC News that most of the reduction in force affected the Offices for Civil Rights and Federal Student Aid. The civil servants who worked for OCR and FSA are tasked with investigating discrimination within America's schools and helping the nation's students achieve higher education.",
      "OCR and FSA staff in almost all regional offices were eliminated, according to the source, who spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity. Therefore, the cuts to nearly half the federal agency will \"absolutely affect\" the department's operations, according to the source familiar with the reductions who works at the department.",
      "\"I don't know how [disabled students] will be serviced,\" said another Department of Education employee who didn't want their name used for this story.",
      "The employee's office is a law enforcement agency charged with enforcing anti-discrimination laws for students based on race, gender and disability, among other characteristics.",
      "By law, the office reviews complaints regarding the nation's most vulnerable students, including Section 504, which helps ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to educational opportunities. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has ensured that programs that are critical to students with disabilities will not be cut.",
      "Shuttering this employee's office -- and other regional offices -- shrinks the number of civil servants around the country who ensure disability services are provided to these students.",
      "The regional Department of Education employee, who received the reduction in force email on Tuesday, told ABC News their civil rights office was abolished.",
      "\"All those disabled kids, which is the bulk of our docket, will not be helped,\" the employee said.",
      "However, McMahon said the agency will still administer those statutory programs that students from disadvantaged backgrounds rely on. In an interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Tuesday night, McMahon suggested the \"good\" employees who administer the statutorily mandated functions will not be harmed in the process.",
      "\"What we did today was to take the first step of eliminating what I think is bureaucratic bloat,\" McMahon said.",
      "\"It's a humanitarian thing to a lot of the folks that are there, they're out of a job, but we wanted to make sure that we kept all of the right people, the good people, to make sure that the outward-facing programs, the grants, the appropriations that come from Congress, all of that are being met and none of that is going to fall through the cracks,\" she said.",
      "Impacted staff will be placed on administrative leave starting March 21, a statement from the Education Department on Tuesday said. They will receive full pay and benefits through June 9, senior officials added.",
      "The statement also said that the DOE will \"continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.\"",
      "But the news of the cuts on Tuesday was demoralizing to the Department of Education employee who is out of a job after more than two decades at the agency.",
      "\"It's upsetting,\" said the employee. \"It doesn't make sense -- it's upside-down world.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said he felt \"very badly\" about the massive cuts at the DOE, but quickly claimed, without evidence, that many of its employees weren't going to work or doing a good job.",
      "\"Now, Department of Education, maybe more so than any other place, has a lot of people that can be cut,\" he said.",
      "He praised McMahon, saying that she is doing a \"very good job.\"",
      "\"We have a dream, the dream is we're going to move the Department of Education, we're going to move education into the states,\" he said.",
      "The Trump administration has urged McMahon to return power to the states, but education is already a local-level issue. The Education Department's responsibility is to administer money, conduct critical research projects and oversee discrimination complaints.",
      "\"We all know that local education agencies and state education agencies -- they control about 95% of what happens in public education,\" the Department of Education employee said. \"The federal government doesn't control curriculum, doesn't control hiring, firing of teachers, doesn't control standardized testing, etc. We don't control anything other than trying to help people, give folks loans so they can maybe help their family and educate themselves and go to college and then make sure that kids that are disabled get the services that the laws say that they're supposed to.\"",
      "The civil servant said that they -- along with the rest of their office -- are now shell shocked.",
      "\"There's no rules in a hostile takeover,\" the employee said. \"They're treating the government like it's a business, and it's not and that's what's unfortunate.\"",

      "The Pentagon's new transgender service member policy faces its first legal test.",
      "A federal judge spent Wednesday morning grilling a Department of Justice lawyer about the legality of the Pentagon's transgender service member ban, repeatedly suggesting the policy relies on a flawed understanding of gender dysphoria.",
      "The Pentagon's new policy to separate transgender U.S. service members from the military is facing its first legal test as U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes considers issuing an order blocking the policy from taking effect.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Judge Reyes said that the government \"egregiously misquoted\" and \"cherry picked\" scientific studies to incorrectly assert that transgender soldiers decrease the readiness and lethality of the military.",
      "While Judge Reyes has not yet issued a formal ruling, she repeatedly suggested that the policy unfairly targets a class of people that the Trump administration dislikes.",
      "\"The question in this case is whether the military under the equal protection rights afforded to every American under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, if the military ... can do that and targeting a specific medical issue that impacts a specific group that the administration disfavors,\" she said.",
      "Judge Reyes also pressed DOJ attorney Jason Manion to identify any other similar medical issues that has prompted a similar response from the Department of Defense.",
      "\"Identify for me a single other time in recent history where the military has excluded a group of people for having a disqualifying issue, because I can't think of one,\" Judge Reyes asked.",
      "Manion answered that the military applied a similar policy for soldiers who declined to take the COVID-19 vaccine, prompting an incredulous Judge Reyes to ask anyone in the gallery to raise their hand if they had gotten COVID.",
      "\"Lots of people raise their hands, right?\" Judge Reyes said. \"All different kinds of people ... so it wasn't just aimed at getting rid of one group of people.\"",
      "The plaintiffs have argued that the DOD's policy -- which was finalized in late February and bans most transgender service members from serving with some exceptions -- violates the Fifth Amendment's right to equal protection and causes irreparable harm by denigrating transgender soldiers, disrupting unit cohesion and weakening the military.",
      "\"This case is a test of the core democratic principle that makes our country worth defending -- that every person is of equal dignity and worth and is entitled to equal protection of the laws,\" the plaintiffs argued.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice have defended the policy by arguing the court should not intervene in military decision-making, describing gender dysphoria as a condition that causes \"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of human functioning.\"",
      "\"DoD has been particularly cautious about service by individuals with mental health conditions, given the unique mental and emotional stresses of military service,\" government lawyers argued.",
      "During a hearing last month, Judge Reyes -- a Biden appointee who was the first LGBT judge on the D.C. District Court -- signaled deep skepticism with the government's claim that transgender service members lessen the military's lethality or readiness, though she declined to intervene until the DOD finalized their policy.",
      "When the policy was formalized last month, she quickly ordered the government to clarify key tenets of their policy, including identifying what \"mental health constraint\" other than gender dysphoria that conflicts with the military's standards of \"honesty, humility, and integrity.\"",
      "She also raised doubts about the government's claims about the exceptions to the policy, flagging on the court's docket a recent DOD social media post that \"transgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\"",
      "The hearing comes amid an increasingly hostile relationship between Judge Reyes and the Department of Justice.",
      "After Judge Reyes excoriated a DOJ lawyer last month during a hearing in the case, the Department of Justice filed a complaint with an appeals judge about what they alleged was Reyes' \"hostile and egregious misconduct.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle alleged that Reyes demonstrated a political bias, compromised the dignity of the proceedings and inappropriately questioned a DOJ attorney about his religious beliefs.",
      "\"At minimum, this matter warrants further investigation to determine whether these incidents represent a pattern of misconduct that requires more significant remedial measures,\" Mizelle wrote.",

      "\"A budget is a reflection of our values,\" Warren said on the floor. \"This proposal makes crystal clear where Republicans' values lie. After months of bipartisan talks, they're walking away from the negotiating table and offering a non-starter House bill that forces us to the brink of a full government shutdown.

      "\"A shutdown is uncharted territory when you've got an administration that at least in some ways probably would welcome a shutdown because that would give the president almost unlimited power: deciding who is essential who is not unessential, folding up agencies,\" King said. \"So that is the dilemma that is being discussed.\"",
      "The House has left town for the week after passing their bill. If Democrats in the Senate want to avoid a shut down on Friday night, they'll have to furnish at least eight votes to do it, with Republican Sen. Rand Paul already stating he'll oppose the package.",

      "Despite pledging during the 2024 campaign that Trump would supercharge the economy on Day 1, House Republicans have so far appeared not to be bothered by the market upheaval and continue to blame Democrats for the state of the economy.",
      "\"Everybody relax. It's going to be okay. Those of you that have your money in the market, don't pull it out now,\" Rep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican and staunch Trump supporter, told ABC News. Nehls contended \"everything will rebound.\"",
      "Asked if what's unfolding is hurting Trump politically, Nehls shifted to talk about Democrats, \"What everybody is seeing is, obviously what they're seeing is the Democrats don't like what Donald Trump is doing, and they're scaring the hell out of people.\"",
      "Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican, also isn't concerned about recent events. She told ABC News, \"I think that's just temporary. You'll see things get better.\"",
      "When asked about Trump's campaign promises on the economy, Malliotakis also pivoted to blame the previous administration.",
      "\"You got to remember that we had four years of a terrible economy because of Joe Biden. Look at what Joe Biden did that was so destructive, the reckless, wasteful spending that was inflationary, the regulations that he added that were burdensome,\" she said.",
      "Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., told ABC News he supports the tariffs and said their impact on the market will \"depend on how permanent they are.\"",
      "\"A threat can have volatility per day, but if it doesn't stay permanent, that threat goes away,\" he added.",
      "Asked if Trump would be at fault if Americans ended up paying more because of the policies, McCormick argued they are already \"paying more because we have unfair trade with other countries.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer placed the blame for recession fears squarely on President Donald Trump's tariffs and rhetoric during floor remarks on Tuesday. He challenged Trump's assertion that this would be a \"golden age\" in America, citing downturned markets and ballooning costs.",
      "\"More trouble for the Trump administration: The Trump economy. Donald Trump promised Americans a golden age on day one. Well today is day 50. And Americans are wondering, scratching their heads, where is this golden age? Can't find this golden age in the inflation numbers because inflation has gone up under Donald Trump from groceries to retail to cars. The idea that he said in the campaign prices will be going down on day one that's by the wayside that's for sure,\" Schumer said in floor remarks.",

      "A closely watched Wisconsin Supreme Court election takes center stage as Republican-backed Brad Schimel and Democratic-backed Susan Crawford are set to debate on Wednesday, locked in a race for a seat that is technically nonpartisan but has become the center of a political firestorm.",
      "The April 1 election will determine which of the candidates, vying to replace retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, will help determine the ideological bent of the court, which currently leans liberal. The winner will join the bench as the court grapples with hot-button issues such as abortion access and redistricting.",
      "The race could also preview how voters in the battleground state feel a few months into President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "\"They're using it as a test as to President Trump's popularity,\" Janine Geske, a law professor at Marquette University and a former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, told ABC News. \"He took Wisconsin in the election. And the question is, how will this election go?\"",
      "The debate, hosted by ABC affiliate WISN-TV at Marquette University Law School, will air online and on ABC News affiliates across Wisconsin at 7 p.m. Central time on Wednesday.",
      "Schimel, the candidate backed by Republicans, is a former state attorney general who is a circuit court judge in Waukesha County.",
      "\"I got in this race 16 months before Election Day because I recognize \u2026 you gotta meet voters where they are,\" Schimel told WISN in February.",
      "Crawford, backed by Democrats, is a Dane County circuit court judge and a former private attorney. She at points represented Democratic-aligned groups such as Planned Parenthood, an organization supporting abortion access.",
      "\"I have spent a lot of time talking about my record, my background as a prosecutor, as a lawyer representing people in court and standing up for their rights,\" Crawford told WISN in February.",
      "Over $40 million has been spent on ad reservations, both aired already and for future reservations, in the race, according to advertisement tracking firm AdImpact. (Recent polling from the Marquette University Law School showed a sizable percentage of voters do not have an opinion on either candidate.)",
      "The election is also seen as one indication of Elon Musk's influence beyond Washington, where he has overseen major cuts to the federal government.",
      "A conservative group affiliated with Musk, Building America's Future, has spent more than $1.6 million on television ads in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, while another one Musk backs, America PAC, has spent over $6 million on get-out-the-vote efforts and digital media, according to state campaign finance records. The expenditures are marked as either opposing Crawford or supporting Schimel.",
      "Musk himself has not weighed in much directly about the race, but he posted on X last month urging people to \"vote Republican for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prevent voting fraud!\" Schimel has said he has never spoken to Musk and told reporters in February, \"I don't have any agenda that I'm working alongside anyone.\"",
      "These groups' investment in the race has sparked pushback from Democrats.",
      "\"Wisconsin voters don't like Elon Musk running our federal government and they don't want him buying elections in Wisconsin either,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin said in a statement on Monday.",
      "Crawford's own support has not been free of scrutiny. Schimel and his supporters have pointed to major donors seemingly supporting Crawford, including liberal billionaire George Soros and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat. According to state campaign finance records, those individuals donated to the Wisconsin Democratic Party, and the state party has donated $2 million to Crawford.",
      "Crawford has said she has made no promises to any donors and has also emphasized her independence.",
      "While this election is being eyed nationally as the first major race of 2025, experts and supporters of either candidate say it also could have major impacts for the state of Wisconsin, including on issues such as redistricting, voting rights and abortion access.",
      "For example, there is a Wisconsin Supreme Court case regarding if the Wisconsin Constitution protects the right to an abortion, which the court might consider after the new justice is seated.",
      "Wisconsin has an 1849 statute on the books that would effectively limit all abortions in the state, although the law is not enforced.",
      "If the court were to determine in a different case that the statute is still in effect and later that abortion access is not protected by the Wisconsin Constitution, it could mean abortion is determined illegal in Wisconsin, Chad Oldfather, another law professor at Marquette University, told ABC News.",
      "The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Schimel had previously indicated support for leaving the 1849 law in place. More recently, Schimel told WISN that on abortion access cases, \"I treasure life even when it's not planned, but I respect that the law puts this in the hands of voters, and I will respect their will. \u2026 [My] personal opinions? No, they don't have any role.\"",
      "Crawford, on her end, told WISN she has made no promises to any abortion access advocacy groups but said she is proud of the work she did as a lawyer \"fighting for people's rights,\" including when representing Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.",
      "Women Speak Out PAC, a group that is affiliated with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a group that opposes abortion access, launched canvassers and volunteers to get out the vote for Schimel. SBA has made a six-figure investment in the race.",
      "\"Lives are literally on the line in this race, and they depend upon Wisconsin voters showing up for Brad Schimel. \u2026 If Schimel doesn't win, the court will be a tool of the Left,\" Kelsey Pritchard, political communications director for SBA, told ABC News in an interview.",
      "EMILY's List, a political group that supports female candidates who support abortion access, has donated to Crawford and ran a digital fundraising campaign to encourage others to donate.",
      "\"As Trump, MAGA Republicans, and unelected billionaires like Elon Musk try to rip away the freedoms we've fought so hard for, electing Judge Susan Crawford to the Wisconsin state Supreme Court means protecting these rights that are under attack,\" EMILY's List President Jessica Mackler said in a statement to ABC News.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two members of an Eastern European criminal organization were \u201chired guns for the government of Iran\u201d in a plot to assassinate an Iran-born journalist at her New York City residence three years ago, a prosecutor told a federal jury in an opening statement on Tuesday at the start of a trial for the men.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacob Gutwillig said the plot to assassinate Masih Alinejad was part of Iran's more than decade-long quest to silence a woman who exposed the Iranian regime for human rights abuses and for silencing political expression.",
      "The prosecutor told jurors they will hear the author and contributor to Voice of America explain why the government of Iran wanted to silence her.",
      "Alinejad fled Iran following the country\u2019s disputed 2009 presidential election and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019. She will describe why she stands up to the Iranian regime, Gutwillig said, and why she \u201crefuses to back down.\u201d",

      "Detective Daniel Smith, the trial's first witness, said Mahdiyev was arrested in July 2022 when he ran a stop sign in Alinejad's neighborhood and was found to be driving despite a suspended driver's license. A search of his car turned up a loaded AK-47 assault rifle, Smith said.",
      "Defense attorneys for Amirov and Omarov told jurors in opening statements that their clients were not guilty and that prosecutors' evidence was merely circumstantial.",

      "The latest monthly Consumer Price Index showed a dozen Grade A eggs cost an average of $5.90 in U.S. cities in February, up 10.4% from a year ago. That eclipsed January's record-high price of $4.95.",
      "Avian flu has forced farmers to slaughter more than 166 million birds, mostly were egg-laying chickens. Just since the start of the year, more than 30 million egg layers have been killed.",

      "The price had consistently been below $2 a dozen for decades before the disease struck. The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects egg prices to rise 41% this year over last year\u2019s average of $3.17 per dozen.",
      "But there may be light at the end of the tunnel. The USDA reported last week that egg shortages are easing and wholesale prices are dropping, which might provide relief on the retail side before this year\u2019s late Easter, which is three weeks later than last year. It said there had been no major bird flu outbreak for two weeks.",
      "\u201cShoppers have begun to see shell egg offerings in the dairycase becoming more reliable although retail price levels have yet to adjust and remain off-putting to many,\u201d the USDA wrote in the March 7 report.",
      "David Anderson, a professor and extension economist for livestock and food marketing at Texas A&M University, said wholesale figures dropping is a good sign that prices could go down as shoppers react to the high prices by buying fewer eggs.",
      "\u201cWhat that should tell us is things are easing a little bit in terms of prices,\u201d he said. \u201cSo going forward, the next CPI report may very well indicate falling egg prices.\u201d",

      "\u201cRecord high prices is a market signal to producers to produce more, but it takes time to be able to produce more, and we just haven\u2019t had enough time for that to happen yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s going to happen. But it\u2019s going to take some more months to get there.\u201d",
      "Advocacy groups and others have also called for a probe into whether egg producers have used the avian flu to price gouge. But egg producers say the avian flu is solely behind the elevated prices.",
      "Meanwhile, restaurants have added surcharges and made other changes to offset the cost of eggs.",
      "The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to combat bird flu, $500 million investment to help farmers bolster biosecurity measures, $400 million in additional aid for farmers whose flocks have been impacted by avian flu, $100 million to research and potentially develop vaccines and therapeutics for U.S. chicken flocks. But it will likely take a while for that plan to make an impact."

      "\u201cWe are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America\u2019s Golden Age,'' EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in an essay in the Wall Street Journal.",

      "A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A former Republican Tennessee lawmaker says President Donald Trump has pardoned him two weeks into his 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme that he pleaded guilty to in 2022, before he tried unsuccessfully to take back his plea.",
      "Former Sen. Brian Kelsey announced that he received a \u201cfull and unconditional pardon\u201d in a social media post Tuesday evening. He had been ordered to report to FCI Ashland's minimum security satellite camp in Kentucky on Feb. 24. A federal database said Kelsey was no longer in Bureau of Prisons custody as of Tuesday.",
      "\u201cMay God bless America, despite the prosecutorial sins it committed against me, President Trump, and others the past four years,\u201d Kelsey said in the post.",
      "The 47-year-old pleaded guilty in November 2022 to charges related to his attempts to funnel campaign money from his state legislative seat toward his failed 2016 congressional bid.",
      "Kelsey was indicted in October 2021. He initially labeled the prosecution a witch hunt and blamed the Democratic administration of then-President Joe Biden. But when a co-defendant pleaded guilty the following October, Kelsey quickly did as well.",
      "He repeated his attack on the Biden administration Tuesday, saying, \u201cGod used Donald Trump to save me from the weaponized Biden DOJ,\u201d referring to the Department of Justice. In 2017, during Trump's first term, Kelsey's campaign finance dealings spurred a complaint by the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center with the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.",
      "Kelsey was unsuccessful in his March 2023 attempt to rescind his guilty plea.",
      "Kelsey had argued he entered the plea with an \u201cunsure heart and a confused mind.\u201d He noted that he and his wife had twin sons born in September 2022, and his father had terminal pancreatic cancer, then died in February 2023.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in Nashville denied the change of plea in May 2023. He expressed disbelief that Kelsey, a Georgetown University-educated attorney and prominent former state senator, didn\u2019t understand the gravity of pleading guilty.",
      "Crenshaw later denied another challenge in which Kelsey accused prosecutors of violating his plea agreement. However, that September the judge also allowed Kelsey to stay out of prison until his appeal was decided. Kelsey\u2019s challenge ultimately failed.",
      "Last month, Crenshaw denied another motion to remain free by Kelsey, who argued he had ineffective legal counsel and that his claim of innocence is supported by recordings by two key witnesses \u2014 the co-defendant, Joshua Smith, and former GOP Rep. Jeremy Durham, who was not charged. The judge responded that Kelsey had given an \u201cunconditional admission of guilt\u201d under penalty of perjury.",
      "Kelsey had another appeal pending as he announced the pardon.",
      "Smith, a Nashville social club owner, pleaded guilty to one count under a deal that required him to \u201ccooperate fully and truthfully.\u201d He was sentenced to five years of probation.",
      "The indictment alleges that Kelsey, Smith and others illegally concealed the transfer of $91,000 \u2014 $66,000 from Kelsey\u2019s state Senate campaign committee and $25,000 from a nonprofit that advocated about legal justice issues \u2014 to a national political organization to fund advertisements urging support of Kelsey\u2019s 2016 failed congressional campaign. The scheme caused the political group to file false campaign finance reports and make illegal, excessive campaign contributions to Kelsey, the indictment says.",
      "Although the indictment does not name the national political organization, the Campaign Legal Center's 2017 complaint said the American Conservative Union was making coordinated independent expenditures with Kelsey\u2019s campaign. The American Conservative Union has said it has cooperated with investigators.",
      "Kelsey, an attorney from Germantown, was first elected to the General Assembly in 2004 as a state representative. He was later elected to the Senate in 2009. He didn\u2019t seek reelection in 2022.",
      "Kelsey served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees changes to civil and criminal laws, judicial proceedings and more. His law license was suspended in 2022 after his guilty plea.",

    "story": [
      "The Associated Press has obtained a document showing that the Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing",
      "The Trump administration is halting a $1 billion program that helps preserve affordable housing, threatening projects that keep tens of thousands of units livable for low-income Americans, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The action is part of a slew of cuts and funding freezes at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, largely at the direction of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, that have rattled the affordable-housing industry.",
      "Preserving these units gets less attention than ribbon-cuttings, but it's a centerpiece of efforts to address the nation's housing crisis. Hundreds of thousands of low-rent apartments, many of them aging and in need of urgent repair, are at risk of being yanked out from under poor Americans.",
      "The program has already awarded the money to projects that would upgrade at least 25,000 affordable units across the country, and details of how it will be wound down remain unclear.",
      "A spokesperson for HUD did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But an internal document reviewed by the AP said that the program is being \u201cterminated\u201d at the direction of DOGE. Two HUD workers, who have knowledge of the program and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, confirmed the directive to shutter it.",
      "On it's face, the over $1 billion Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, passed by Congress in 2022, is intended for energy-efficiency improvements. It is distributed in grants and loans to owners of affordable housing in need of updating, including replacing or repairing heating and cooling systems, leaky roofs, aging insulation or windows, or undertaking floodproofing.",
      "But the money plays a much larger role in preserving affordable units.",
      "Projects that use the funds are required to keep their buildings affordable for up to 25 years. The money is also leveraged to pull in other investments for major repairs and renovations needed to keep the buildings livable.",
      "It's like building a Jenga tower, where one of the program's grants or loans \u2014 which range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 is a bottom block and each new block is another investment, experts said.",
      "This money \u201cwas essential in order for the project to come together,\u201d said Mike Essian, vice president at American Community Developers, Inc., which received funding for several affordable housing projects. \u201cProjects will fail and these are projects that are already difficult to finance.\u201d",
      "The news has been a jolt to Al Hase and Joan Starr, tenants in an apartment building in Vancouver, Washington, full of other low-income seniors with few or no other options \u2014 most of whom live on less than $33,000 a year.",
      "The 170-unit Smith Tower Apartments, built in the 1960s, is in need of updates, including it's first building-wide sprinkler system. The $10 million award was a financial kickstart for its nearly $100 million project, and is cited in applications for other investments.",
      "The potential loss \u201cseriously jeopardizes our ability to be able to provide an upgrade to the current systems,\u201d said Greg Franks, president of the property\u2019s management company, adding that the work is \"needed to sustain the livability of this building based on its age, and to keep it viable for another 60 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are depending on that $10 million,\u201d he said.",
      "So, too, are Hase and Starr, a retired couple in their 70s who have lived there for 16 years.",
      "They fill their balcony with geraniums and petunias, count the eagles at a nearby park and live off of meager Social Security incomes. They learned about the potential funding loss in a letter from the apartment's management company.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kinda terrifying, it\u2019s almost like getting news from a doctor that something's going to take your life in six months or a year,\u201d Hase told the AP in a phone call.",
      "\u201cWe're from an era where the wages weren't there, so our Social Security ...\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cSucks,\u201d pitched in Starr.",
      "\u201cIf I'd been born a rich man,\u201d he said. Starr added: \u201cWe\u2019re just regular people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd we're the lucky ones because we've got two social securities coming in,\" she said.",
      "But being lucky ones still doesn't count for much in today's rental market. \u201cPrices keep going up, I've looked, and there's no way,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between living and not being able to live,\" he said.",
      "HUD's lack of communication about the program's future sent organizations in search of contingency plans, though roughly two dozen projects will still get funding, one HUD employee told the AP. The rest are in limbo.",
      "\u201cIf these funds aren\u2019t reinstated, we will certainly seek other funding to fill that gap. The reality is that will take time and will inevitably make the project more expensive,\u201d Travis Phillips of the Housing Development Center said of funding for Smith Tower.",
      "It's the position several hundred other affordable-housing projects now find themselves in across 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cIn all honesty,\u201d said Michelle Arevalos, Smith Tower's administrator, \u201cif this building were not here, a lot of our folks actually probably would be homeless.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump campaigned as a champion of free speech, but First Amendment advocates say they\u2019ve never seen freedom of speech under attack the way it has been in his second term",
      "DENVER -- When President Donald Trump gave his joint address to Congress last week, he boasted that in his first few weeks back in the White House he had \u201cbrought free speech back to America.\u201d",
      "But First Amendment advocates say they've never seen freedom of speech under attack the way it has been in Trump's second term.",
      "Trump's Republican administration has threatened Democratic members of Congress with investigation for criticizing conservatives, pulled federal grants that include language it opposes, sanctioned law firms that represent Trump's political opponents and arrested the organizer of student protests that Trump criticized as \u201canti-Semitic, anti-American.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour right to say something depends on what the administration thinks of it, which is no free speech at all,\u201d said Will Creeley, legal director of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan First Amendment group.",
      "Trump on Monday took credit for the arrest by immigration agents of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent resident who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests there. Khalil's lawyers say the government is targeting him for his activism and to \u201cdiscriminate against particular viewpoints.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration will revoke the visas or green cards of supporters of Hamas, which the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization, \"so they can be deported.\u201d The government has not yet filed documents specifying why Khalil was detained, and a federal judge earlier this week ordered immigration officials not to remove Khalil from the country while his case is sorted out.",
      "Trump supporters, including members of Congress, have argued that because Khalil is not a U.S. citizen, the government can target him for his speech, which they contend amounts to sympathy for terrorism.",
      "\u201cThis is the first arrest of many to come. We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "Even some Trump allies were uncomfortable with that approach: \u201cThere's almost no one I don't want to deport,\u201d wrote conservative commentator Ann Coulter on X, \u201cbut, unless they've committed a crime, isn't this a violation of the first amendment?\u201d",
      "On the other end of the political spectrum, activists who organized to protest the war in Gaza were aghast at the administration's move.",
      "\u201cWe learn about our First Amendment rights since we\u2019re children,\u201d said Germ\u00e1n Rafael Gonz\u00e1lez, a member of Stanford University's Students for Justice in Palestine. \u201cBut that is very much a myth. It\u2019s not the reality we live in right now. And it\u2019s scary.\u201d",
      "Prior to the arrest of Khalil over the weekend, the administration pressured Columbia University to crack down on anti-Israel activism among students and faculty, and Trump has threatened to go after any college that supports protests he deems \u201cillegal.\u201d",
      "He also issued an order forbidding federal funding of what his administration labels diversity, equity and inclusion, which led to a freeze on federal grants as the administration reviews them for forbidden words such as \u201cgender.\u201d",
      "Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, which sued the Trump administration over its DEI ban and won an injunction against it from a federal judge, said the administration is pulling funding from projects that have prohibited words, yanking grants from research into such areas as crop diversity or differences in infant mortality in urban and rural areas.",
      "\u201cNobody really wants Big Brother telling you what you can research,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cThese are questions our country needs to know the answers to.\u201d",
      "Republicans for several years have been the party complaining about infringements on the First Amendment, from complaints about \u201cwoke\u201d colleges canceling conservative speakers to bashing social media companies they accuse of censoring conservative viewpoints, including cutting Trump off after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol. GOP-controlled Florida and Texas even drew up laws to limit how social media firms regulate content, though the U.S. Supreme Court kept them on hold last year because of possible First Amendment violations.",
      "Last year, Trump positioned himself as a champion of the First Amendment during his campaign, and he signed an executive order just hours after being sworn into office prohibiting anyone in the federal government from interfering with Americans' free speech rights. But he also made pledges that signaled he might oppose some of the First Amendment's fundamental protections, such as deporting foreign students who protested Israel or outlawing flag-burning, which the Supreme Court has ruled is protected free speech.",
      "Creeley, of the individual rights foundation, said he tried to be optimistic before Trump took office that the new president would fix some First Amendment issues. Instead, he said, it's gotten worse.",
      "\u201cI cannot recall anything like this,\" Creeley said. \"I've been defending First Amendment rights since 2006, and this is the most serious of threats I can recall.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration also has gone after the news media.",
      "The president has sued several outlets for coverage he dislikes, and his appointees at the Federal Communications Commission have helped pressure those media companies. Meanwhile, Trump's FCC is opening investigations of other media companies with which Trump has feuded, and the administration has barred The Associated Press from the White House press pool because it won't use Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico. The AP is suing to restore its access on First Amendment grounds.",
      "The administration also has targeted law firms for their affiliations with Democrats or the previous administration. It stripped security clearances for lawyers at a firm that helped special counsel Jack Smith's investigations of Trump during President Joe Biden's administration and Perkins Coie, a longtime Democratic firm that Trump blames for the investigation into his campaign's relationship with Russia during his first term. On Tuesday, Perkins Coie sued the administration to reverse the action, saying it violated the First Amendment and other constitutional guarantees.",
      "Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, said the attacks on the law firms have scared some high-profile attorneys out of taking cases that challenge the administration, which, he contended, is the point.",
      "\u201cThere's a long tradition of lawyers taking on controversial clients, sometimes against our government,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cThe Trump administration has made it clear it will retaliate against lawyers.\u201d",
      "Jaffer said attacks on free speech and association are intended to chill dissent by convincing people in the opposition that they could become targets.",
      "\u201cAll of us are able to participate in government by engaging in protest,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cWhen the government shuts down that kind of speech, it's shutting down democracy.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has even targeted members of Congress.",
      "Trump appointed Ed Martin, a defense attorney who represented some of those charged in the Jan. 6 attack, as acting U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia. Martin wrote to Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and one of the nation's top Democrats, telling him that a comment he made in 2020 warning conservative Supreme Court judges they would \u201cpay the price\u201d for overturning the right to abortion could be seen as a threat. Schumer has since apologized for the statement.",
      "Martin also wrote to Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, warning him that comments he made about Trump adviser Elon Musk could be seen as a threat. Garcia had said Democrats should \u201cbring actual weapons to this bar fight.\u201d",
      "\u201cMembers of Congress must have the right to forcefully oppose the Trump Administration,\" Garcia replied on Musk\u2019s X platform. \"I will not be silenced.\u201d",

      "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has pledged to start paying out tens of billions in aid to victims of Hurricane Helene later this month",
      "ATLANTA -- Tens of billions in aid for victims of Hurricane Helene should start flowing later this month, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins pledged Wednesday, but delays are already making it hard this year for some farmers to plant crops.",
      "Congress set a deadline of March 21 to hand out the money when it passed a $100 billion disaster relief package on Dec. 21. The late September storm cut a swath from Florida's Big Bend across eastern Georgia and upstate South Carolina before causing historic flooding in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee.",
      "The National Centers for Environmental Information says Helene is the seventh-most expensive disaster in the United States since 1980, causing an estimated $78 billion in damage and 219 deaths.",
      "At a news conference in Atlanta on Wednesday, Rollins pledged the aid would begin to be disbursed before the deadline.",
      "\u201cThat money will begin to move in the next few weeks,\" she said.",
      "That's not a moment too soon for Chris Hopkins, who farms near Lyons in south Georgia. Helene wiped out half the cotton Hopkins was growing on 1,400 acres (560 hectares). He said Tuesday that he began planting 300 acres (121 hectares) of corn this month, and plans to start planting cotton in late April.",
      "Hopkins said the big losses forced him to dip into emergency reserve funds to pay off $200,000 in 2024 loans for seed, fertilizer and other materials. Some neighboring farmers hit hard by the storm still have unpaid debts from last year, he said, leaving them unable to borrow more to start planting 2025 crops.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s desperately needed,\u201d Hopkins said of federal aid. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that producers are almost in a holding or pause pattern because they can\u2019t afford to pay their rent or their loans.\u201d",
      "Hopkins said farmers had hoped the money would come sooner, in January or February, so they could pay off creditors before planting season. He said some have sold equipment or even land to generate enough cash to get new crops started.",
      "\u201cThe general consensus in the farming and ag community is that it would have been much better earlier,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cAg producers are thankful for it by all means. But taking the full 90 days to get it is tough.\u201d",
      "In South Carolina, Republican legislative leaders decided to wait to approve Helene damage relief money in the state\u2019s regular budget instead of an emergency bill in part because they expected federal officials to get relief money out quickly.",
      "Most but not all of the disaster relief bill is earmarked for Helene. It includes $21 billion to help farmers, $8 billion to rebuild damaged roads and highways, $12 billion in grants to help communities and individuals recover and $2.2 billion in low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners.",
      "Officials have estimated that Helene caused property and economic damage to the agriculture sector totaling $5.5 billion in Georgia and $4.9 billion in North Carolina.",
      "Beyond the cotton crop, the storm toppled pecan trees and flattened chicken houses in Georgia. Farming in western North Carolina is dominated by specialty crops including Christmas trees and nursery plants, with fewer growers covered by crop insurance.",
      "South Carolina officials estimated $620 million in agriculture damage in 2024, not just from Helene, but also from other weather disasters.",
      "State governments have been moving to expand their aid packages. Georgia has earmarked $285 million for low-interest loans for farmers and removing downed timber from private land in an amended budget that Gov. Brian Kemp signed last week, part of $862 million in Helene-related spending.",
      "North Carolina lawmakers are negotiating the details of a supplemental Helene relief bill that may total more than $500 million, in part to provide more funds for crop losses. It would be North Carolina\u2019s fourth Helene aid package to be enacted. The state has requested close to $1.9 billion from the disaster relief law approved by Congress in December. Most of that money would go to address crop and timber losses, debris removal, stream restoration and erosion.",
      "The South Carolina House on Wednesday gave final approval to a budget that includes $220 million in Helene relief for farmers and others as a match to money from the federal government. They also set aside $50 million to give to the state Department of Transportation to pay back what they spent repairing roads and clearing trees.",

      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- A 37-year-old man died after falling from a chairlift that was having a mechanical problem at a Montana ski area, according to the local sheriff and a spokesperson for Red Lodge Mountain.",
      "The man was riding alone in a three-person chair that carries skiers up the mountain when he fell from an unspecified height, according to Red Lodge Mountain spokesperson Troy Hawks. The accident happened Monday just before noon at the ski area southeast of Billings in the Beartooth Mountains.",
      "Jeffrey Zinne of Billings was taken to a Billings hospital where he died Tuesday night from injuries suffered in the fall, Carbon County Sheriff Josh McQuillan said.",
      "The lift, known as the Triple Chair, was stopped after the accident. More than 100 people who were on it at the time were evacuated by ski patrollers who used ropes to lower them to the ground.",
      "Hawks said the lift had a mechanical problem at the time Zinne fell, but declined to comment further and said the circumstances were being investigated. Weather conditions and the victim's actions also were being looked at, he said.",
      "On the morning of the accident, some other chairlifts at Red Lodge Mountain were not operating because of high winds. Wind gusts of about 50 mph (80.4 kph) were recorded in the area shortly before and after the accident, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Hawks said the Triple Chairlift, which is almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) long and was built in 1983, was operating within safety parameters. It will remain shut down until an engineer fully assesses it, Hawks said.",
      "Fatal lift accidents at ski areas are relatively rare, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Between 1956 and 2024, 35 people died in accidents involving chairlifts and aerial ropeways. Sixteen of the deaths were linked to mechanical malfunctions, according to data collected by the group.",
      "The latest death during that time period was in 2020, when a man died at Colorado's Vail resort after his clothing got entangled in part of the chairlift, making him unable to breathe."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge says President Donald Trump overstepped his authority in freezing almost all spending on U.S. humanitarian and development work abroad",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump overstepped his constitutional authority in freezing almost all spending on U.S. humanitarian and development work abroad, a federal judge ruled, saying the administration could no longer simply sit on the tens of billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated for foreign aid.",
      "But Judge Amir H. Ali stopped short of ordering Trump officials to use the money to revive the thousands of contracts they have abruptly terminated for U.S. aid and development work around the world.",
      "Ali's ruling Monday evening came hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the administration had finished what has been a six-week purge of programs of the six-decade-old U.S. Agency for International Development, cutting 83% of them. Rubio said he would move the remaining aid programs under the State Department.",
      "Rubio made his announcement in a post on X, in one of his few public comments on what has been a historic shift away from U.S. foreign aid and development, executed by Trump political appointees at the State Department and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency teams.",
      "Rubio in the post thanked DOGE and \u201cour hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform\u201d in foreign aid.",
      "Trump on Jan. 20 issued an executive order directing a freeze of foreign assistance funding and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. Trump charged that much of foreign assistance was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.",
      "Rubio's social media post Monday said that review was now \u201cofficially ending,\" with some 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs eliminated. Those programs \u201cspent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote. About 1,000 remaining contracts would now be administered by the State Department, he said.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and others call the shutdown of congressionally funded programs illegal, saying such a move requires Congress' approval.",
      "In his preliminary injunction Monday, Ali said Trump could not simply ignore most of what is roughly $60 billion in foreign assistance funding that was given to USAID and State by Congress, which under the U.S. Constitution has the authority to spend money.",
      "\u201cThe constitutional power over whether to spend foreign aid is not the President\u2019s own \u2014 and it is Congress\u2019s own,\u201d Ali wrote, adding elsewhere that Trump officials \u201coffer an unbridled view of Executive power that the Supreme Court has consistently rejected.\u201d",
      "But Ali declined the request from nonprofit groups and businesses to revive the canceled contracts for foreign assistance work around the world, saying it was up to the administration to make decisions on specific contracts. The mass contract cancellations also were a separate matter than the funding freeze that two global health groups, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, had originally gone to court to challenge, he said.",
      "Ali also ordered Trump officials to pay all of the roughly $2 billion it owed to aid groups and businesses up to mid-February, and ordered them to do it at a pace of at least 300 back payments a day.",
      "Despite claims from the administration it was continuing to fund at least life-saving programs in its foreign aid freeze, USAID staffers and the agency's nonprofit and business partners say all payments through USAID were cut off until recently, and that USAID's payment system itself disabled by Musk's DOGE.",
      "Ali's ruling came after the Supreme Court had rejected the Trump administration's appeal in the case.",
      "USAID supporters said the sweep of the cuts have made it difficult to tell what U.S. efforts abroad the Trump administration actually supports.",
      "\u201cThe patterns that are emerging is the administration does not support democracy programs, they don\u2019t support civil society ... they don\u2019t support NGO programs,\u201d or health or emergency response, said Andrew Natsios, the USAID administrator for Republican former President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cSo what\u2019s left\u201d?\u201d Natsios asked.",
      "Republicans broadly have made clear they want foreign assistance that would promote a far narrower interpretation of U.S. national interests going forward.",
      "The dismantling of USAID that followed Trump\u2019s order upended decades of policy that humanitarian and development aid abroad advanced U.S. national security by stabilizing regions and economies, strengthening alliances and building goodwill.",
      "The State Department said in a court filing earlier this month it was killing more than 90% of USAID programs. Rubio gave no explanation for why his number was lower.",
      "In the weeks after Trump's order, one of his appointees and transition team members, Pete Marocco, and Musk pulled USAID staff around the world off the job through forced leaves and firings, shut down USAID payments overnight and terminated aid and development contracts by the thousands.",
      "The shutdown has left many USAID staffers and contractors and their families still overseas, many of them awaiting back payments and travel expenses to return home.",
      "The Trump administration on Monday gave USAID staffers abroad until April 6 to move back to the United States if they want to do so on the government\u2019s tab, according to a USAID email sent to staffers and seen by The Associated Press. Staffers say the deadline gives them scant time to pull children from school, sell homes or break leases, and, for many, find somewhere to live after years away from the United States.",

      "Who killed Donald Goines",
      "DETROIT -- Who killed Donald Goines?",
      "Producers of a documentary on the life of the prisoner-turned urban fiction writer of novels about the violence, drugs and prostitution that he surrounded himself with in Detroit are hoping the answer hasn't been lost to time \u2014 or the streets.",
      "It's been more than 50 years since Goines and his common-law wife, Shirley Sailor, were found shot to death on Oct. 21, 1974 in their flat in Highland Park, a small enclave of Detroit. Each had been shot five times. Their two young children were home at the time of the killings.",
      "Goines was 37.",
      "No arrests were made and rumors swelled. Some speculated the killings had something to do with Goines' heroin addiction. Others nodded to the theory that the fictional subjects of his novels appeared a bit too much like the real-life hustlers, pimps, drug dealers and stickup men who prowled the city's streets.",
      "\u201cThere have been at least a half-dozen, quite possibly a dozen, elements of speculation as to how Mr. Goines and the mother of his children were murdered,\u201d said Bill Proctor, a private investigator hired to find the killer or killers. \u201cBut no one has come forward with enough information to charge the persons responsible.\u201d",
      "Proctor said a $5,000 reward being offered by the producers of the documentary might help \u201cshake the trees\u201d and find \u201csomeone who might still be alive or have an understanding\u201d of the facts of the case.",
      "Goines wrote 16 books over a span of several short years. His raw, stark and undiluted writings are filled with the urban street life imagery of the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "\u201cDopefiend,\u201d was published in 1971. Fifteen more including \u201cStreet Players,\u201d \u201cDaddy Cool\u201d and \u201cKenyatta's Last Hit,\u201d would follow over the next three years. The titles and the content resonated with many Black readers, especially in Detroit where Goines' books often held prominence on living room coffee tables and bookshelves.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his books, I can visualize \u2014 I can picture what he\u2019s writing about,\u201d said his daughter, Donna Sailor. \u201cHe was so descriptive about what he wrote. That\u2019s kind of like how it was back then.\u201d",
      "Donna Sailor was 2 when her parents were killed. She doesn\u2019t remember anything about the shooting or her parents.",
      "\u201cWe would see friends of the family that knew my dad and my mom,\u201d Sailor, 52, told The Associated Press Thursday. \u201cThey would say she was a sweetheart, and she was funny and had a great smile.\u201d",
      "Less information about Goines was volunteered, though, she added.",
      "\u201cNo one ever went into great detail about him. They would say he was a nice guy,\u201d said Sailor.",
      "The urban lit genre dates back at least to 1967, and the release of the memoir \u201cPimp,\u201d written by Robert Maupin, who also was in jail when he began writing under the name Iceberg Slim. Maupin built a large word-of-mouth following and one of his readers was Goines. Generations later, hip-hop stars like Tupac Shakur were also inspired by the books and have referenced Goines and Iceberg Slim in their recordings. Shakur even once declared: \u201cMachiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines my father figure.\u201d",
      "Goines' parents owned a clothes-cleaning and other businesses in Detroit and were part of the city's Black middle class. He enlisted in the Air Force and spent time in Korea and Japan during the Korean War. It was there Goines became addicted to heroin, according to various reports on his life.",
      "After his time in the military, Goines returned to Detroit in the mid-1950s. He drifted into the city's criminal underbelly, finding himself jailed for various crimes.",
      "Holloway House published Goines' novels from 1971 to 2008, according to current publisher Kensington.",
      "Under Kensington, Goines books have sold about 500,000 copies in print, alone. He consistently is one of Kensington's top reordered authors and his books have been \u201cselling at a stronger pace\u201d since it launched a reissue program in 2020, according to the company.",
      "Robert (Tape) Bailey and Craig Gore are the driving forces behind the documentary which is expected to be released by the end of the year. Both read Goines\u2019 books while incarcerated, separately.",
      "Bailey, 49, was born in Detroit and now lives in Los Angeles. He spent time in federal prison as young man for possession with intent to deliver drugs in Ohio.",
      "Goines wrote in detail about things he had witnessed firsthand, Bailey said.",
      "Gore, 51, of Los Angeles, stumbled onto Goines while serving time for burglary and theft. He says that through the $5,000 reward, they hope to bring more accuracy to the documentary.",
      "\u201cWe might find nothing. We might solve the murder,\u201d he said."

Seven of the civil rights agency's 12 regional offices were entirely laid off, including busy hubs in New York, Chicago and Dallas. Despite assurances that the department's work will continue unaffected, huge numbers of cases appear to be in limbo.",

      "Many lawyers at the New York City office were juggling 80 or more cases, said one staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for reprisals. The branch often mediated cases with New York City schools, the nation\u2019s largest district, and its lawyers were handling a high-profile antisemitism investigation at Columbia University \u2014 a priority for President Donald Trump.",
      "The staffer described several pending cases involving students with disabilities who are wrongly being kept out of school because of behavioral issues. With limited oversight from the office, they said, school districts will be less likely to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Pillera, who had said before the cuts that he was leaving the department, said it's unclear how complaints will be investigated in areas that no longer have offices.",
      "\u201cWe have to physically go to schools,\u201d Pillera said. \u201cWe have to look at the playground to see if it\u2019s accessible for kids with disabilities. We have to measure doorways and bathrooms to see if everything is accessible for kids with disabilities.\u201d",
      "Even before the layoffs, the civil rights office had been losing staff even as complaints rose to record levels. The workforce had fallen below 600 staffers before Trump took office, and they faced nearly 23,000 complaints filed last year, more than ever.",
      "Trump officials ordered a freeze on most cases when they arrived at the department, adding to the backlog. When Education Secretary Linda McMahon lifted the freeze last week, there were more than 20,000 pending cases.",
      "Historically, most of the office\u2019s work deals with disability rights cases, but it has fielded growing numbers of complaints alleging discrimination based on sex or race. It has also played a prominent role in investigating complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia amid the Israel-Hamas war and a wave of campus demonstrations that spread across the country last year.",
      "Craig Trainor, Trump\u2019s appointee over the office, directed staff to focus on antisemitism cases as a top priority last week. In a memo, he accused former President Joe Biden of failing to hold colleges accountable and promised tougher action against violators.",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon said the goal is not to defund key programs but to make them operate more efficiently. She vowed to uphold the agency\u2019s civil rights work but said it might fit better being moved to the Justice Department.",
      "An email the Education Department sent to all staff after the layoffs said there will need to be significant changes to how they work.",
      "\u201cWhat we choose to prioritize, and in turn, not prioritize, will be critical in this transition,\u201d the message said.",

      "TACOMA, Wash. -- A baby sea lion toting an artificial kelp strip was filmed performing intricate rhythmic gymnastics-esque circles through the waters of an aquarium in Washington state.",
      "Although only 9 months old and still reliant on her mother's milk, Pepper has become the Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium's most acrobatic sea lion, said Noelle Tremonti, a staff biologist for the aquarium.",
      "\u201cWe always joke a little bit that she\u2019s acting as a ribbon dancer because it does look so artistic under the water and shockingly beautiful under the water as well,\" she said. \"But also just makes me really happy to see her interacting with enrichment in such a focused way.\u201d",
      "The dizzying circles performed in Tacoma, Washington, about 34 miles (55 kilometers) south of Seattle, last month are part of the sea lion\u2019s many enrichment activities. The strips help the pup learn how to interact with kelp, which it would be around a lot in its natural environment, and how to explore its environment using its mouth, said Tremonti.",
      "The strip, which is made out of heavy duty felt material, is just small enough for Pepper to grab and manipulate, said Tremonti. In the video, the sea lion pulls it with its flipper while chasing the tail end to create the graceful circles and later clamps down on the strip with its mouth.",
      "Pepper was the first sea lion born at the aquarium in its 120-year history. Now 74 pounds (33.5 kilograms), it recently ate its first fish, although it mostly just likes to play with them.",
      "But the playful and inquisitive sea lion's favorite activity is flipping around with kelp strips.",
      "\u201cShe will dedicate a good portion of her day to finding different things to do with the kelp strips,\u201d said Tremonti. \"It\u2019s really fun to watch.\u201d"

      "Measles outbreaks in West Texas and New Mexico are now up to more than 250 cases, and two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "Here's what you need to know about measles in the U.S.",
      "Texas state health officials said Tuesday there were 25 new cases of measles since the end of last week, bringing Texas' total to 223. Twenty-nine people in Texas are hospitalized.",
      "New Mexico health officials announced Friday that there were 30 cases in Lea County, which neighbors the West Texas communities at the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "A school-age child died of measles in Texas last month, and New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult last week.",
      "Measles cases have been reported in Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases \u2014 and there have been three clusters that qualified as outbreaks in 2025.",
      "In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are generally traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",
      "Adults with \u201cpresumptive evidence of immunity\u201d generally don\u2019t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.",
      "A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don't always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary.",
      "Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.",
      "People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don\u2019t know which type they got.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "In communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called \u201cherd immunity.\u201d",
      "But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- The mayor of Wisconsin's capital city said Wednesday she has placed the municipal clerk on leave as investigators work to determine how she failed to count almost 200 absentee ballots in the November election.",
      "Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said in a statement that the city has launched an investigation and that she needed to suspend City Clerk Maribeth Witzel-Behl to maintain public confidence in the clerk\u2019s office. The mayor added that the city will spare no expense to ensure every vote is counted heading into the swing state's spring election. The state Elections Commission also is investigating whether Witzel-Behl violated any state laws or abused her discretion.",
      "The uncounted ballots did not change the results of any races but four Madison voters whose ballots weren\u2019t counted filed claims last week for $175,000 each from the city and Dane County, the first step toward initiating a lawsuit.",
      "No listing for Witzel-Behl's personal contact information could be immediately found.",
      "The suspension comes with the state's April 1 general election just weeks away. The highest-profile race is between conservative Brad Schimel and liberal Susan Crawford for an open state Supreme Court seat. The outcome will determine the ideological balance of the court as it ponders cases involving abortion, the strength of public sector unions, voting rules and congressional district boundaries. Early voting begins next week.",
      "Rhodes-Conway said in her statement that she has appointed City Attorney Michael Haas as interim city clerk and that she expects he will ensure the election runs smoothly in Madison. Haas has previously worked as administrator and attorney for the state elections commission.",
      "According to commission investigators, Wiztel-Behl\u2019s office discovered 67 unprocessed absentee ballots in a courier bag that had been placed in a security cart. The discovery came on Nov. 12, seven days after the election, while county workers were conducting the official count of election results.",
      "Witzel-Behl said she told two employees to notify the elections commission, but neither did. A third city worker visited the Dane County Clerk\u2019s Office to inform officials there, but that employee said the county didn\u2019t want the ballots for the count, known as a canvass. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell has said he knew nothing of the uncounted ballots until they were reported in the media.",
      "Witzel-Behl\u2019s office found another 125 uncounted absentee ballots in a sealed courier bag in a supply tote on Dec. 2. According to commission investigators, Witzel-Behl said she didn\u2019t inform county canvassers because the canvass was finished. She added that based on the county\u2019s response to the Nov. 12 discovery she didn\u2019t think the county would be interested.",
      "The commission wasn\u2019t notified of either discovery until Dec. 18. Witzel-Behl told investigators that the employees she asked to notify the commission waited until reconciliation was completed. That\u2019s a routine process in which poll workers and elections officials ensure an election\u2019s accuracy, including checking the number of ballots issued at the polls against the number of voters. She couldn\u2019t explain why she didn\u2019t contact county officials or the elections commission herself, according to the investigators.",
      "The elections commission was expected to approve guidelines during a late-afternoon meeting Wednesday to help clerks around the state ensure they count every ballot in the spring election.",
      "The recommendations include thoroughly documenting any incidents on election day; making sure all materials are returned from the polling sites; checking voting equipment\u2019s ballot bins for anything that might have been missed; and immediately reporting any mistakes to county officials and the commission."

      "The killing rocked the small Appalachian community of Whitesburg, where residents knew Shawn \u201cMickey\u201d Stines to be longtime friends with District Judge Kevin Mullins. Prosecutors have presented a video in court of a man police identified as Stines pulling out a handgun and shooting Mullins at his desk on Sept. 19.",

      "The justices did not give Trump's administration what it sought. The court rejected the Republican administration's position that it had the immediate power to fire the head of a watchdog office. In the other, the court slowed the effort to block the release of up to $2 billion in foreign aid.",
      "In the end, the short-term losses for the administration may mean little, and the court's actions arguably reflect less about whether Trump was right or wrong in either case.",
      "Instead, they may stand for an important, but less showy, commitment to regular order from the top of a judicial system that has emerged as a key check on Trump\u2019s power with the Republican-controlled Congress largely supportive or silent.",
      "Jack Goldsmith, a Justice Department official during President George W.

      "His push to end birthright citizenship for the children of parents who are in the U.S. illegally, for instance, would discard more than 100 years of practice and a relatively settled understanding of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States.\u201d",

The Federal Judges Association, the largest such organization, issued a rare public statement decrying \u201cirresponsible rhetoric shrouded in disinformation\u201d that could undermine public confidence in the judiciary.",
      "Though Trump has said he would obey the courts, Vice President JD Vance, Musk and others have suggested the administration could defy a court order, which would spark a constitutional crisis. Trump has vowed to appeal decisions he doesn't like, something his administration has done quickly in several cases even as some plaintiffs question whether the government is fully following judges' orders.",
      "\u201cIt seemed to me that they're playing pretty fast and loose,\u201d said Jeffrey Schmitt, a professor at the University of Dayton School of Law. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as blatantly disrespecting the courts and refusing to follow their orders.

Instead, he wrote, district judges \u201care now confident they can issue any order they wish against the executive branch, and the Supreme Court will not stop them. This is the judiciary run amok.\u201d",
      "But while they sparked online outrage in some quarters of the president's base, the events of the past few days could be seen as validation for the justices' cautious approach.",
      "On Feb. 21, a Supreme Court order temporarily kept Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel, in his job despite efforts by Trump to fire him.",

      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes have adopted sharply different approaches to handling Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House",
      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014",
      "Days after Donald Trump was elected to a second term, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs headed to the Mexican border with a conciliatory message.",
      "\u201cBorder security was a core issue of the Trump campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cI look forward to having conversations with the incoming president about Arizona\u2019s needs.\u201d",
      "Back in Phoenix, Attorney General Kris Mayes was plotting a legal strategy that has led so far to five lawsuits against the Trump administration, on average one every 10 days since she took office.",
      "Both Hobbs and Mayes are Democrats who will seek reelection next year in a state that went for Trump. But they have adopted sharply different approaches to handling Trump\u2019s return to the White House: Restrained and collaborative for Hobbs; hardened and embattled for Mayes.",
      "The strategies encapsulate the debate consuming Democrats around the country trying to find a path back to power. In winning over working class voters, Trump scrambled political allegiances and left Democrats struggling to piece together a viable coalition.",
      "Arizona's two top elected officials are making different bets about what voters will be looking for next year. Hobbs and Mayes both narrowly won their offices in 2022. Mayes\u2019 280-vote victory was the closest in state history, and Hobbs won by less than 1 percentage point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you can yield to authoritarian, anti-democratic behavior when it\u2019s in the White House and when our country is in as much danger as it is right now,\u201d Mayes said in a recent interview. \u201cOur country has never been in this much peril since the Civil War.\u201d",
      "Hobbs declined an interview request. Her team issued a memo last week saying Arizona voters would see she \u201cis serious about putting partisan politics aside to get things done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey see her work with the Trump Administration and Republican Legislature when they share common goals, and they see her stand up to far-right proposals when they are out of touch with Arizona,\u201d wrote Nicole DeMont, the governor\u2019s chief political strategist.",
      "The disparate approaches owe somewhat to their differing roles. As governor, Hobbs has to work with a Trump-friendly Republican legislature and may need to cajole the White House for federal assistance during Trump\u2019s presidency. As attorney general, Mayes has the prerogative to fight in court.",
      "Mayes is also prosecuting Trump aides and allies involved in his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "The dynamic is much the same in Michigan, another battleground state Trump won narrowly, where Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel is aggressively confronting the Trump administration both legally and rhetorically, while Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been more restrained.",
      "Mayes and Nessel, both serving as the chief law enforcement officers of battleground states, have started a podcast together, \u201cPantsuits and Lawsuits.\u201d",
      "In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has been at times solicitous of Trump and Republicans as he pleads for disaster aid to recover from wildfires as Attorney General Rob Bonta sues.",
      "To be clear, neither Hobbs nor Mayes could be mistaken for a Trump supporter. But their differing approaches began even before the election, when Mayes routinely appeared with Democrat Kamala Harris and her surrogates when they visited Arizona, while Hobbs kept her distance.",
      "Mayes first sued Trump the day after he took office, when she joined a coalition of Democratic attorneys general suing to block an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.",

      "The U.N. chief is launching a new initiative to reform the United Nations as it approaches its 80th anniversary",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. chief launched a new initiative Wednesday to reform the United Nations as it approaches its 80th anniversary, saying the 193-member global organization needs an urgent update to deal with major funding reductions and still tackle the world's challenges.",
      "Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres dismissed any relationship between his UN80 Initiative and cuts to foreign aid and other programs that U.S. President Donald Trump and ally Elon Musk say will make the U.S. government more efficient.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about completely different processes, methodologies and objectives,\u201d Guterres told reporters. \u201cThis is a continuation and an intensification of work that we have always been doing.\u201d",
      "He said the U.N. initiative\u2019s objective will be to present member states with proposals for improving the way the organization works, reviewing the increasing number of mandates from the U.N. Security Council and General Assembly, and making structural changes to streamline operations.",
      "Guterres and his predecessors in past decades have struggled to reform the United Nations, which was established following World War II, and bring it into a modern era with different powers, new technology and greater global divisions.",
      "One key problem is that while the secretary-general is the U.N.\u2019s chief executive, power rests with the 193 member nations that have very different ideas about the U.N. and the world.",
      "Stressing that the United Nations reflects the world, Guterres said these are times of intense uncertainty and unpredictability.",
      "He said the U.N.\u2019s work is affected by multiplying conflicts, inadequate progress in reducing poverty, widespread flouting of international law, violations of human rights and the lack of guardrails for new technologies, including artificial intelligence \u2014 to name a few.",
      "\u201cAnd all of them are aggravated by major reductions of funding for humanitarian aid and development cooperation,\u201d the secretary-general said. \u201cIn many cases, these obstacles are fueling dangerous levels of geopolitical tensions and divisions.\u201d",
      "Guterres didn\u2019t name any countries, but the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was in charge of humanitarian aid, and cut 83% of USAID's programs. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, also are reducing humanitarian aid.",
      "He said the U.N.\u2019s resources have been shrinking, pointing to its liquidity crisis for at least the past seven years because not all member states pay their yearly dues, and many don\u2019t pay on time.",
      "Guterres said the UN80 Initiative is not only about reforming the U.N. but about \u201cbetter serving people whose very lives depend on us\u201d and \u201ctaxpayers around the world who underwrite everything we do.\u201d",
      "The initiative will cover not only the U.N. Secretariat but all its funds and agencies and offices in Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna. It will be led by U.N. Undersecretary-General for Policy Guy Ryder, who will head a task force of top officials from the U.N. system, Guterres said.",
      "The U.N. budget for 2025, which was adopted last December, is $3.72 billion."

      "WASHINGTON -- A small U.S. federal agency that invests in African small businesses is expected in court on Tuesday to fight for control over its operations and existence.",
      "The U.S. African Development Foundation last week tried to keep staff from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from entering their offices in Washington. DOGE staff managed to gain entry after returning with U.S. Marshals.",
      "Ward Brehm, the president of USADF, last week sued the Trump administration, saying in a complaint that the attempted takeover was illegal and that neither President Donald Trump nor DOGE had the authority to shut down its operations or replace its board members and president.",
      "Hours later, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon in Washington temporarily barred the administration from replacing USADF's leadership. Leon will hear arguments Tuesday from government lawyers and attorney's representing Brehm about whether the Trump administration can remove the board members and appoint new ones.",
      "Trump last month in an executive order targeted USADF and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the federal government. The independent agency was created in 1980 by Congress and is controlled by board members, who must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.",
      "A primary question in the case is whether the Trump administration has the legal authority to remove the independent board members. Presidents are restricted from firing these members without cause, thanks to a nearly 90-year-old Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey\u2019s Executer, which has been a backstop for advocates in court against the Trump administrations' firings. More recent Supreme Court decisions have expanded the president\u2019s removal power and legal experts say the high court's conservative majority may be inclined to overturn that precedent.",
      "In a filing on Monday, attorneys for the government claimed the Trump administration last month removed USADF's board members by emails from the White House. USDAF challenged that account, saying that just one board member, Brehm, received a removal email.",
      "The remaining board members made Brehm president on March 3. The previous USADF president resigned before the agency was targeted for elimination.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration have argued that USADF's board has, \u201cdone everything possible to avoid complying with the President\u2019s clear directives,\u201d and that \u201cthe President must be able to designate acting officials to fulfill his duty to enforce the laws.\u201d",
      "Congress in 2023 allocated $46 million to USADF to invest in relatively small agricultural projects and energy infrastructure projects among other economic development initiatives in 22 African countries. The agency employs around 50 people.",
      "In court filings, USADF describes staff from DOGE demanding access to their systems, which staff denied citing privacy and security requirements. They also said DOGE emailed USADF's staff last month announcing that Pete Marocco, the deputy administrator of USAID who has overseen its dismantling, would chair USADF's board.",
      "Marocco and some of the same DOGE staff have succeeded in shuttering another independent agency, the Inter-American Foundation. On Feb. 28, a White House official told IAF staff that Marocco would chair the agency's board, according to a letter sent to Congress by Eddy Arriola, the chair of IAF's board.",
      "The same day, Marocco held an emergency board meeting outside of IAF's offices because he was not able to gain entry to the building. In notes entered into the Federal Register, Marocco said he designated himself the acting CEO and president of IAF, seemingly firing the sitting president.",
      "Since, IAF's grants and contracts have been cancelled and most of its 37 staff members have been laid off. In 2024, IAF oversaw almost $350 million in investments in Latin American and the Caribbean, with a little more than half of that coming from outside funds, meaning from countries or private funders.",

    "story": [
      "An advocacy group says it's time for states to stop requiring abortion providers to file reports for every abortion",
      "States should stop requiring health providers to file reports on every abortion because the information poses a risk to both them and their patients in the current political environment, a research group that advocates for abortion access says.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute says in a new recommendation that the benefit of mandated and detailed data collection is no longer worth the downsides: It could reveal personal information, be stigmatizing for patients and cumbersome for providers \u2014 or could be used in investigations.",
      "\u201cIt would be a mistake for anyone to assume now that the information a state could collect about abortion would not be used to harm people,\u201d said Kelly Baden, Guttmacher\u2019s vice president for public policy.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade nearly three years ago, it opened the door for states to ban most abortions. It also ignited policy battles over information collected about ending pregnancies.",
      "The possibility of reports being used in investigations has increased with the return of President Donald Trump and anti-abortion officials in key federal government jobs, Baden said.",
      "Most state health departments require medical providers to report data about each abortion, though without including patient names. Massachusetts and Illinois mandate that providers give the state only aggregated data.",
      "The states that collect the information, in turn, produce reports on abortion statistics and send their information to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a nationwide tally. Together, that information gives a picture of how often abortion takes place, when in the pregnancy the abortion occurs and the age of patients.",
      "Those reports provide the fullest government pictures of abortion nationally, but they come with a lag time of about two years and lack data from states that don't require the reports: California, the country's most-populous state, as well as Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey.",
      "Certain information that some states collect \u2014 such as the patient\u2019s marital status or ZIP code and the reason for the abortion \u2014 do not serve a meaningful research purpose and could stigmatize patients, says Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet. In conjunction with other data, these details could even be used to identify people who obtain abortions, he said.",
      "The same level of detail is not required to be reported to the state for other medical care, Maddow-Zimet added.",
      "\u201cThe real concern here is that it fits into a broader pattern of abortion exceptionalism,\u201d he said.",
      "But Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said rolling back reporting requirements can be detrimental: It could downplay the frequency of abortion complications, for instance, she said. Additionally, details such as the reason for the abortion could shape public policy if it reveals increases in sexual assault, she said.",
      "\u201cThe more information we have, the better it is for women,\u201d Tobias said.",
      "An Indiana anti-abortion group began using public records requests to obtain individual abortion reports from the state in 2022 and report on alleged violations by providers \u2014 including submitting the reports late.",
      "The state Health Department eventually declared that individual reports are not public records because a ban on most abortions means so few happen that the reports could be used to reveal who's obtaining them. Earlier this year, state Attorney General Todd Rokita settled a lawsuit from the group, Voices for Life, by mandating that reports \u2014 with some personal information redacted \u2014 be available to the public. But the documents are not being provided as litigation continues.",
      "Melanie Garcia Lyon, the Voices for Life executive director, said in an email that one doctor had his licensed suspended in part because of a violation that someone spotted in a terminated pregnancy report. \u201cAbortion reporting protects women,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Michigan has halted required reporting. Minnesota has removed some required information, such as the marital status, race and ethnicity of patients.",
      "Arizona's Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat in a state where Republicans control the legislature, is calling for that state to drop mandated reporting. A bill that would repeal the requirements hasn't advanced.",
      "Connie Fei Lu, a medical fellow in complex family planning at the University of Illinois Chicago, said the 2022 Illinois change to collect a tally of abortions rather than detail on each one can protect the privacy of patients, especially those who travel from other states for abortion.",
      "But she said the data collection policies need to be thoughtful.",
      "\u201cI completely understand the delicate balance in abortion data collection in an environment where that data can end up in the wrong hands,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a research perspective, from a scientific perspective, not having this data is not a good thing.\u201d",
      "While Guttmacher wants an end to mandatory abortion reports, it's not calling for states to get out of the abortion data-collection business entirely; the group says states could instead use voluntary approaches to gather information.",
      "Guttmacher and another abortion-rights group, the Society of Family Planning, have been surveying providers over the past few years. The groups' analyses rely in part on estimates, but they have been released much more quickly than government data and have become key resources for understanding the impact of state bans and restrictions since Roe was overturned."

      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",

      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",

    "summary": "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to protect disabled people claiming welfare payments from expected cuts to the benefits system.",
      "The health and disability-related benefits bill is now \u00a365bn a year and projected to increase to \u00a3100bn over the next four years, with research suggesting rising levels of mental ill health are behind the figures.",
      "The government is identifying cuts to the welfare budget ahead of the Spring Statement, with the PM working to rally MPs to support the move.",
      "Sir Keir was challenged at PMQs by Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey and Labour's Richard Burgon, who said disabled people were \"frightened\" and suggested \"the moral thing to do\" would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
      "Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Expected cuts could fall on Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit (UC).",
      "Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.",
      "Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\"",
      "Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax.",
      "Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\".",
      "On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\"",
      "Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,",
      "Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".",
      "\"It's a generational thing \u2013 if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said.",
      "\"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\"",
      "Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\".",
      "But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\".",
      "\"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said.",
      "Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.",
      "\"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.",
      "\"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\"",
      "Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.",
      "But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work.",
      "That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC.",
      "Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\".",
      "\"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said.",
      "\"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not,\" said another.",
      "In the UK 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions \u2013 44% of all claimants, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found.",
      "Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims.",
      "More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS.",
      "Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims.",
      "There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems.",
      "There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness.",
      "Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\".",
      "He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support.",
      "\"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.",
      "\"A major lesson from the Tory years is that austerity damaged the nation's health - we must not make the same mistake again.\"",

      "The listing makes no mention of Apple or the government, nor has the Tribunal confirmed if they are the parties involved - however a source familiar with the matter has indicated that is the case, as was first reported by Computer Weekly.",

      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",

      "He added that Martin should \"remind President Trump that Ireland, despite its small size, is one of the largest investors in the United States and one of the largest job creators in the United States\".",
      "\"On the one hand, [Trump] likes to say, you know, we're the best, he's the best, He's the greatest. Everything is a superlative.",
      "\"But then in the next breath, he says, we're suckers, we're losers, we're being taken advantage of by every other country.\"",

    "summary": "Economists say the president's import taxes could result in higher prices for a range of products in the US.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs - or import taxes - on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners.",
      "The tariffs apply to steel and aluminium imported to the US, as well as to some other products from Mexico, Canada and China - prompting counter-measures from the latter two countries and the European Union.",
      "Economists have warned the US tariffs - and those introduced in response by other countries - could put prices up for American consumers.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, which may choose to pass the cost on to customers, or to reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available.",
      "So which things could become more expensive?",
      "Cars",
      "Some cars are among the products given a temporary reprieve by Trump from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "When this ends, cars are expected to go up in price - by about $3,000 (\u00a32,300) according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "Many well-known car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors and Honda trade parts and vehicles across the three countries.",
      "The cost of the higher taxes due on imported components is likely to be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said TD Economics' Andrew Foran.",
      "He argued that the \"uninterrupted free trade\" which has \"existed for decades\" in the car-making sector has lowered prices for consumers.",
      "Follow live updates on Trump's tariffsWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Follow live updates on Trump's tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Beer, whisky and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that firms could decide to bring in less foreign beer.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "The picture is more complicated when it comes to spirits, which have been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s.",
      "Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They argue that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises.",
      "The bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in the US, Canada and Mexico.",
      "Houses",
      "The US imports about a third of its softwood lumber from Canada each year, and that key building material could be hit by Trump's tariffs.",
      "Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders urged the president to exempt building materials \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry group has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Imports from the rest of the world could also be affected.",
      "On 1 March, Trump ordered an investigation into whether the US should place additional tariffs on most lumber and timber imports, regardless of their country of origin, or create incentives to boost domestic production.",
      "Findings are due towards the end of 2025.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "The \"most obvious\" household impact of a trade war with Canada would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson from the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but [which use] inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil.",
      "According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November 2024 came from Canada.",
      "While the US has introduced a 25% tariff on most goods imported from Canada, Canadian energy faces a lower rate of 10%.",
      "The US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but its refineries are designed to process so-called \"heavier\" - or thicker - crude oil, which mostly comes from Canada, with some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided to reduce crude oil exports in retaliation against US tariffs, it could push up fuel prices.",
      "Avocados",
      "Avocados thrive in in the Mexican climate.",
      "Nearly 90% of the avocados consumed in the US come from Mexico.",
      "The US Agriculture Department has warned that tariffs on Mexican fruit and vegetables could increase the cost of avocados.",

      "People protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company.",
      "Trump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it.",
      "Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.",
      "Trump said they were \"harming a great American company\", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would \"go through hell\".",
      "The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as \"beautiful\" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.",
      "He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.",
      "The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.",
      "Trump said he had told Musk, \"You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.\"",
      "Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "He has instigated sweeping cuts to federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.",
      "That has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners.",
      "\"Tesla takedown\" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand.",

      "Is Trump reining in Musk after a cabinet showdown with secretaries?",
      "Who is Elon Musk?",
      "Asked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled \"domestic terrorists\", the president said \"I will do that\", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson.",
      "\"You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,\" Trump said.",
      "On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on \"radical left lunatics\", who he said were trying to \"illegally and collusively boycott\" the firm.",
      "However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",
      "UBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.",
      "Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics having a \"brand impact\", there were other reasons for the share price fall.",
      "Ultimately the drop came down to \"hard numbers\", she said.",
      "\"When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,\" she said.",
      "Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).",
      "There has also been a steep decline in China \u2013 a key market \u2013 and Australia.",
      "Other experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies.",
      "Investors are \"certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days\", Ms James said.",
      "There have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.",
      "In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses \"with great difficulty\".",
      "Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.",
      "Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.",
      "Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.",
      "Tesla's share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.",
      "Trump's own economic policies on tariffs are also making investors nervous, analysts said.",

      "That included simplifying systems, such as the declaration of income from so-called side-hustles for tax purposes.",
      "It also meant learning from the private sector to make customer service more efficient.",
      "A report by the Public Accounts Committee of MPs in January included figures that showed the failings of HMRC's phone line.",
      "It went dead on 43,690 customers who had been waiting 70 minutes to reach an adviser in the first 11 months of the 2023-24 financial year.",
      "This was because HMRC's system could not cope with the volume of calls, but customers were not warned they were about to be cut off, nor were they called back, the report added.",
      "The committee claimed HMRC was running a \"deliberately poor\" phone service in an attempt to push taxpayers to seek help online instead.",
      "However, that claim was described as \"completely baseless\" by HMRC bosses who said they had made huge improvements to service standards.",
      "In March last year, HMRC announced its phone line would be closed between April and September, but was forced to reverse its decision within 24 hours."

    "summary": "The measure is part of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced to Parliament.",
    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",
      "Up to \u00a32,500 off energy bills for people living within 500m of new pylonsStreamlining the process for approving key projects like wind farms, roads or railways and banning multiple \"meritless\" legal challenges.Allowing \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served process\" which the government says has clogged up the system",

      "Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said the plans would be \"backing the builders\" and \"taking on the blockers\" to create \"the biggest building boom in a generation\".",

      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

    "story": [
      "People protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company.",
      "Trump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it.",
      "Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.",
      "Trump said they were \"harming a great American company\", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would \"go through hell\".",
      "The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as \"beautiful\" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.",
      "He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.",
      "The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.",
      "Trump said he had told Musk, \"You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.\"",
      "Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "He has instigated sweeping cuts to federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.",
      "That has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners.",
      "\"Tesla takedown\" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand.",

      "Musk's Tesla facilities in US face 'Takedown' protests",
      "Is Trump reining in Musk after a cabinet showdown with secretaries?",
      "Who is Elon Musk?",
      "Asked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled \"domestic terrorists\", the president said \"I will do that\", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson.",
      "\"You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,\" Trump said.",
      "On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on \"radical left lunatics\", who he said were trying to \"illegally and collusively boycott\" the firm.",
      "However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.",
      "UBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.",
      "Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics having a \"brand impact\", there were other reasons for the share price fall.",
      "Ultimately the drop came down to \"hard numbers\", she said.",
      "\"When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,\" she said.",
      "Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).",
      "There has also been a steep decline in China \u2013 a key market \u2013 and Australia.",
      "Other experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies.",
      "Investors are \"certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days\", Ms James said.",
      "There have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.",
      "In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses \"with great difficulty\".",
      "Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.",
      "Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.",
      "Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.",
      "Tesla's share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.",
      "Trump's own economic policies on tariffs are also making investors nervous, analysts said.",

      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",

      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:26:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will make a key decision which could unlock compensation for millions of motorists.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of motorists could be in line for compensation payouts if they were mis-sold finance agreements when buying a car.",
      "Investigations are ongoing into activities by dealers and lenders \u2013 some of which have now been banned \u2013 which could eventually lead to an industry-wide payout scheme to consumers.",
      "A significant Court of Appeal decision may extend compensation to a wider group of people, prompting huge debate among consumers and policymakers. The Supreme Court will soon hear an appeal of that ruling.",
      "What's the scandal about?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In 2021, the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).",
      "The FCA said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "Currently, any claims on this issue made to the ombudsman, which has tens of thousands of open cases, or the courts are effectively on hold.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "Potentially, millions of motorists could receive payouts, depending on how their interest rate was set and what they knew about it. Those who had a finance deal, which had a DCA, before 28 January 2021 could receive compensation.",
      "This would likely be done through a central scheme, organised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which wants an orderly compensation system in place.",
      "It would be simpler for consumers than filing a legal complaint and would require firms to check if customers had lost out.",
      "If such a plan was confirmed then further details, such as whether motorists would need to make a complaint first, would need to be ironed out.",
      "The FCA said such a scheme was now more likely to happen than when it first opened the investigation.",
      "How much could they receive?",
      "That is far from clear yet, but lenders \u2013 including some of the UK's biggest banks \u2013 have set aside billions of pounds already.",
      "A driver would likely receive the difference between the amount they paid at an inflated interest rate and the rate they should have been charged.",
      "Interest of 8% on the overpayment would be added to that loss, which could significantly increase the payout.",
      "Exact amounts would depend on individual circumstances.",
      "Is this a wider issue?",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal at the end of last year has blown open the ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "The hearing included the test case of Marcus Johnson, 34, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, who bought his first car - a Suzuki Swift - in 2017.",
      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Car loan scandal payout fears as row drags on",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers and motor finance providers receiving a deluge of new complaints, and it is urging people to make a claim if they feel they were the victims of mis-selling.",
      "Under the FCA's plans, providers will have until December to consider and respond to complaints, aligning the deadline for firms to deal with discretionary and non-discretionary arrangement complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "But the Supreme Court will soon hear an appeal against the decision on the wider commission issue.",
      "The total cost of compensation could reach \u00a325bn or more, according to analysts.",
      "When will the Supreme Court make a decision?",
      "The hearing is scheduled for three days, starting on 1 April.",
      "A judgement by the court judges will be made some time later.",
      "In February, the Supreme Court rejected an unusual intervention from the government, which was worried huge amounts of redress payments could upset the car market and make it less competitive.",
      "It could also affect banks' ability to invest elsewhere as they would need the money for compensation."

    "story": [
      "Experts have cast doubt on Elon Musk's claim that a large-scale outage which hit X was caused by hackers in Ukraine.",
      "Platform monitor Downdetector says it had more than 1.6 million reports of problems with the social media site from users around the world on Monday.",
      "\"We're not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down the X system with IP [Internet Protocol] addresses originating in the Ukraine area,\" Musk said in an interview with the Fox Business channel.",
      "However, Ciaran Martin, professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government told the BBC that explanation was \"wholly unconvincing\" and \"pretty much garbage.\"",
      "Prof Martin - former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre - says it looks as if X was targeted by what's known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where hackers flood a server with internet traffic to prevent users from connecting to a website.",
      "\"It's not that sophisticated - it's a very old technique,\" Mr Martin told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"I can't think of a company of the size and standing internationally of X that's fallen over to a DDoS attack for a very long time,\" he added.",
      "He said the incident at X \"doesn't reflect well on their cyber security.\"",
      "Many users trying to access the platform and refresh feeds on its app and desktop site during Monday's outages were met with a loading icon.",
      "Musk, who has been a frequent critic of Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky, has offered no evidence to support his claim and did not say whether or not he thought state actors were involved.",
      "He posted on X that \"either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved\".",
      "But Prof Martin said tracing IP addresses \"tells you absolutely nothing,\" because hackers in this situation would hijack devices from all over the world.",
      "The BBC has approached the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC for comment.",
      "Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said its own metrics suggested the outages could well be linked to a cyber attack.",
      "\"What we've been seeing is consistent with what we've seen in past denial of service attacks, rather than a configuration or coding error in the platform,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said the organisation has seen several major outages spanning more than six hours on Monday, \"each having global impact\".",
      "\"This is amongst the longest X/Twitter outages we've tracked in terms of duration, and the pattern is consistent with a denial of service attack targeting X's infrastructure at scale,\" he added.",
      "Musk has previously claimed that the platform has been targeted by DDoS attacks, but these have not been confirmed.",
      "Like all major social networks, X is a regular target for disruptive and attention seeking attacks.",
      "But X has a track record of falling due to these attacks much more than other larger sites like Facebook and Instagram.",
      "In 2023, a small group of hackers called Anonymous Sudan took the site offline in more than a dozen countries for hours in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.",
      "Two men were arrested in 2024 for being the ringleaders of the group - showing that hackers can disrupt X with DDoS attacks from anywhere in the world with the right tools and expertise.",
      "Cyber specialists are seeing a \"sharp rise\" in DDoS attacks which are becoming \"an increasingly popular tool\" for criminals, according to Sian John, chief technology officer at cyber security company NCC Group.",

      "Published1 day ago",
      "Thames Water, the UK's biggest water company, is in financial crisis and has secured a rescue loan to avoid coming under government control.",
      "However, creditors have won the right to challenge the High Court's decision to allow \u00a33bn funding and their appeal begins on Tuesday.",
      "Even with the rescue deal, Thames still has huge debts and is struggling to fix leaks, sewage spills and modernise outdated infrastructure.",
      "Thames serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people.",
      "Without this latest financial lifeline, it had faced running out of money by the end of March.",
      "How did Thames end up with so much debt?",
      "Many UK water companies have large debts, but Thames Water's problems are the worst.",
      "Water companies were privatised in 1989, with the idea that private investment would improve the system.",
      "But critics say this hasn't happened - some companies have taken on too much debt and failed to invest in infrastructure.",
      "When Thames was privatised in 1989, it had no debt. But over the years it borrowed heavily and now has debts of about \u00a319bn.",
      "Its debt pile increased sharply when Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank, owned Thames Water, with debts reaching more than \u00a310bn by the time the company was sold in 2017.",
      "Macquarie said it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's water and sewage infrastructure while it owned the company, but critics argue that it took billions of pounds out of the company in loans and dividends.",
      "Will the rescue deal avert crisis for Thames?",
      "Thames says the \u00a33bn in emergency funding will give it the space needed to complete a restructuring of its debts and attract a cash injection from prospective new investors.",
      "But the proposals had to be approved by the High Court after a group of creditors opposed it, arguing that the 9.75% interest rate on the loan was too costly.",
      "However, that group of creditors is now appealing against the High Court's decision.",
      "If the funding deal had not been approved, Thames faced the possibility of a temporary nationalisation, under a measure known as a Special Administration Regime.",
      "What will that mean for customers?",
      "Even if Thames Water had come under special administration, customers would have seen no impact on their services. Taps would still have run and toilets still have flushed.",
      "However, water bills in general are set to rise, with the rate at which they are due to increase set by the water regulator Ofwat.",
      "Ofwat, the water regulator, says that Thames Water can increase bills by up to 35% - excluding inflation - over the next five years.",
      "But the company says it needs a 53% rise to fix pipes and keep up with demand. It has appealed for permission to charge more.",
      "Customers are unhappy. Consumer groups argue people shouldn't have to pay more because the company has been badly run.",
      "But Sir Adrian Montague, Thames Water's chairman, has warned that without bigger price rises, the company cannot guarantee safe and resilient water supplies that can cope with climate change and population growth.",
      "Who owns Thames Water now?",
      "Thames Water is privately owned by a group of pension funds and investment firms. The biggest shareholders include:",

      "Why was Thames Water privatised?",
      "The entire water and waste sector was privatised 34 years ago under the late Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government for \u00a37.6bn. At the time, Mrs Thatcher wrote off the industry's \u00a35bn debt, leaving companies with a clean slate and gave them \u00a31.5bn in public money.",
      "The government had wanted to privatise the industry in 1984 but a public backlash against the plan saw it shelved until after the general election three years later. At the time, the UK was under pressure from Europe to improve the purity of its water.",
      "However, meeting European standards would cost billions of pounds worth of investment which, it was hoped, would come from the private sector and, by extension, companies' customers.",
      "\"If we want environmental improvement, it will cost money,\" said Mrs Thatcher in 1988. \"It will be the people who want those improvements in water who will have to pay.\"",
      "Former Labour MP Ann Taylor later said of privatising the water industry: \"The message is always the same - maximise the cost to the consumer to ensure maximum return to the investor. We should not be surprised at that. After all, that is what private investors expect of their companies.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canada's most populous province Ontario is slapping a retaliatory 25% surcharge on electricity it sends to US states in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "Ontario leader Doug Ford confirmed the move in a news conference on Monday morning, saying it will increase costs for affected US customers by an average of $100 (\u00a377.65) per month.",
      "Roughly 1.5 million American homes and businesses in the northern border states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota will be impacted.",
      "Ford said that the surcharge on energy will remain until the threat of tariffs from the US \"is gone for good.\"",
      "\"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses,\" Ford said in a statement on Monday.",
      "At Monday's news conference, Ford threatened to escalate further if the US increases their tariffs on Canada.",
      "\"I will not hesitate to increase this charge if necessary,\" he said. \"If the US escalates, I will not hesitate to shut off electricity completely.\"",
      "He added that he understands the tariffs are not the fault of the American people, blaming Trump solely for them. \"Believe me when I say I don't want to do this,\" Ford remarked, though he added: \"As premier, my number one job is to protect the people of Ontario.\"",
      "Ford said that Ontario will be using the revenue from its retaliatory tariffs on energy to support local workers and businesses impacted by US tariffs on Canada.",
      "Canada's federal government has also imposed its own dollar-for-dollar reciprocal tariffs on $30bn worth of US goods exported north. The list of products impacted ranges from clothing to perfume to orange juice.",
      "Trump responded to the surcharge in a social media post on Tuesday, saying \"your not even allowed to do that\".",
      "He said the US would \"get it all back\" with its own reciprocal tariffs in the coming weeks.",
      "\"Canada is a Tariff abuser, and always has been, but the United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has threatened Canada repeatedly with a blanket 25% tariff on all Canadian exports to the US - a move that economists have warned could result in job losses in Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "The US has threatened similar tariffs on neighbouring Mexico as well.",
      "Last week, Trump imposed the levies but quickly reversed course, saying he would temporarily spare carmakers from tariffs until 2 April.",
      "He later carved out further exemptions on goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) agreement, which Trump signed in his first term. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%.",
      "Trump, however, is still expected to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium some time this week.",
      "Governors from states affected by the electricity tax also responded.",
      "Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul has commissioned a review of the impact of Trump's tariffs and Ford's response on energy prices and supply reliability in the state.",
      "\"These federal tariffs have been poorly conceived from the start: crafted in secret with no transparency and no clear economic rationale, they've only served to destabilize our capital markets and create uncertainty among New York families and businesses,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence.",
      "The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, has plunged to its lowest point since September, after Trump imposed the tariffs last week and later declined to rule out the possibility of a recession.",
      "In a Fox News interview that was taped on Thursday, Trump said \"I hate to predict things like that\" in response to the possibility of a severe economic downturn, after saying that the tariffs could bring about a \"period of transition.\"",
      "\"It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,\" Trump said."

President Xi Jinping is now betting big on it, as a slowing Chinese economy grapples with the blow of tariffs from its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "Beijing plans to invest 10tn Chinese yuan ($1.4tn; \u00a31tn) in the next 15 years as it competes with Washington to gain the edge in advanced tech. AI funding got yet another boost at the government's annual political gathering, which is currently under way. This comes on the heels of a 60 billion yuan-AI investment fund created in January, just days after the US further tightened export controls for advanced chips and placed more Chinese firms on a trade blacklist.",
      "But DeepSeek has shown that Chinese companies can overcome these barriers. And that's what has stunned Silicon Valley and industry experts \u2013 they did not expect China to catch up so soon.",

      "\"Parents will ask about the price, then they will ask where I am from. They expect me to come from the US or Europe. They seem surprised that I am from China,\" Mr Tang said, smiling. \"There will always be one or two seconds of silence when I say I am from China.\"",

      "That's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. \"Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,\" Xi told party leaders last week.",
      "Ever since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has \"been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,\" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. \"In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.\"",
      "Behind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.",
      "The company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.",
      "\"Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,\" Mr Lyu insists.",
      "The success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and \"is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,\" he added.",
      "\"It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.\"",

The machines fell when they clashed \u2013 and one of them was even taken off the field in a stretcher by their human handler who was keen to keep the joke going.",

      "But as the world learns of China's AI potential, there are also concerns about what AI is allowing the Chinese government to learn about its users.",
      "AI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.",
      "The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.",
      "But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.",
      "That same fear \u2013 where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.",
      "Chinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that \"privacy was a red line\" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.",
      "\"DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,\" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that \"the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain\".",
      "But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.",
      "So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.",
      "So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.",
      "\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"",
      "This could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.",
      "Xi has repeatedly declared \"technological self-reliance\" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.",
      "The Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race \u2013 the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for \"AI triumphalism\" because China was still in \"catch-up mode\".",

    "summary": "Households near new pylons are set to get up to \u00a3250 a year off their energy bills, under government plans.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of reducing energy bills for people who live near pylons will be paid for by increasing average annual bills across the country by 80p, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has told the BBC.",
      "Under the government's plans, households in Great Britain within 500m of new or upgraded pylons will get discounts of up to \u00a32,500 over 10 years, equivalent to \u00a3250 a year.",
      "Miliband said the costs of the scheme were \"more than offset\" by the benefits of the new infrastructure.",
      "He added that the idea was not about buying people off but \"recognising the service\" they were doing for the whole country.",
      "However, rural campaign groups said it was \"impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape\".",
      "A government-commissioned report found hundreds of miles of new pylons will be needed to meet its clean energy targets.",
      "But new infrastructure proposals have sparked fierce opposition from residents in parts of the country like Norfolk and Suffolk, with campaigners arguing they will destroy the countryside.",
      "The bill discounts, which will be funded by electricity suppliers, are expected to be in place from 2026.",
      "Suppliers are expected to recoup costs by passing them on to other customers.",
      "Miliband told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're having to switch off offshore wind farms because we haven't got the transmission infrastructure.",
      "\"So everybody benefits from this. Everybody gets lower bills, and those who live near pylons are given a recognition of what they're doing.\"",
      "The idea forms part of the government's Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which is due to be published this week.",
      "The legislation aims to speed up the building of new homes and infrastructure by cutting red tape and simplifying the planning process.",
      "The government has put the changes at the heart of its push for economic growth.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said local people would still be \"part of the process\", but it would be \"streamlined\" so development was not \"continually blocked for years and years\".",

      "Why more pylons could be headed your way",
      "Can electricity pylons ever be beautiful?",
      "Alongside money off bills, the government will publish new guidance on how developers should provide benefits to communities hosting transmission infrastructure, by funding projects like sports clubs, educational programmes or leisure facilities.",
      "The government said this would mean communities could get \u00a3200,000 worth of funding per km of overhead electricity cable in their area, and \u00a3530,000 per substation.",
      "Initial analysis estimates both bill discounts and community funds could see a total additional cost of between \u00a31-2 a year for the average customer over 10 years.",
      "The government is also looking at how communities near onshore wind farms and other energy infrastructure can receive benefits.",
      "The plans were welcomed by RenewableUK, which represents the sector.",
      "The group's head of policy, James Robottom, said bill discounts would \"help to enable the roll-out of much-needed new grid infrastructure at a faster pace, so that we can make the most of the vast amounts of clean power we're producing\".",
      "However, Jackie Copley, campaign lead at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \"Investing in local green spaces or improving community infrastructure would be a better way to spend this money.",
      "\"Paying individuals comes with many problems, including questions of fairness, likely legal challenges, and the fact that it's impossible to put a price on the loss of a landscape.\"",
      "The idea of giving people living near new pylons money off their energy bills was also proposed under the previous Conservative government.",
      "A government survey in 2024 suggested 78% of people would find an energy infrastructure project more acceptable if they were offered discounts on their bills.",
      "Some energy companies already offer bill discounts to customers who live near infrastructure like wind turbines, while grants are also available for local communities affected.",
      "The bill also includes measures that would allow \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served\" process.",
      "The government says the existing system is being \"clogged up\" by speculative projects creating 10 year waits for \"viable infrastructure\".",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced the number of bodies which get a say in planning decisions could be cut.",
      "Officials will consult on removing Sport England, the Theatres Trust and the Garden History Society from the list of \"statutory consultees\", who are legally required to provide advice on decisions.",
      "The government said in some cases organisations were slowing down building, giving the example of a housing development in Bradford which was delayed because the application was thought to have not adequately considered the speed of cricket balls from a nearby club.",

    "story": [
      "Anita Smith has always been cautious about how much she shared online.",
      "But her concerns increased following an abusive relationship with a partner, who later stalked her.",
      "Although police intervened, she left the UK and also scaled back her online profile.",
      "\"I erased my online presence as much as I possibly could, including removing the locations of some posts, and a couple of Instagram accounts,\" says Ms Smith, whose name has been changed for this article.",
      "Ms Smith, who works in communications, still has a LinkedIn account but doesn't use her full name.",
      "\"I deleted quite a few things off my LinkedIn too, lots of things that were location based, although a few posts do remain.",
      "\"I have posted recently as I'm trying to build a brand although I'm sceptical as to how much I share.\"",
      "She has kept an original private Facebook account: \"I cleanse it once a year, and check on photos and privacy of posts and where I have been tagged.\"",
      "Ms Smith has also become more aware of the terms and conditions of social media platforms.",
      "\"I follow AI trends and I know a lot of images are training AI models and we don't have ethical guidelines on how they can be used. That's another massive factor why I will never put my child on social media as the images can be used for whatever want.\"",
      "As scams become more sophisticated, research suggests that more people are concerned about the information they share online.",
      "In a report by Statista, 39% of respondents said they were worried about how companies use their online data, while a quarter (26%) admitted to using a VPN.",
      "There are a number of reasons why people might want to reduce their online profiles.",
      "\"First of all, people underappreciate privacy,\" says Vytautas Kaziukonis, chief executive at Surfshark, a security software company that encrypts user's online data and aims to make browsing secure.",
      "\"What might be innocent information right now might be bring you into difficulties 10 years down the line, for example, if there's a change of laws, or political environment.\"",
      "Another issue is the explosion of AI, says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"Fraud is getting better and better, and one thing that is essential for all scams is having data,\" he says.",
      "AI is getting to the stage where it can impersonate people close to you. Add to that ability any personal information shared online, then you have a \"deadly combination\", says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Also, information shared online about us is collected by data brokers and sold to advertisers.",
      "Mr Kaziukonis says the information is also available to scammers. \"It's the Wild West out there,\" he says.",
      "So what can we do to minimise our footprints?",
      "Firstly, it's important to think about how much information you share online.",
      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"",
      "It's worth remembering that under data protection law, you have the right to ask a company what data they hold on you, and request that it is deleted.",
      "\"They have to comply as otherwise they can receive huge fines,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "Gus Hosein, executive director at charity Privacy International, recommends several ways to reduce your digital footprint.",
      "He suggests using a VPN (virtual private network) which, for a price, offers a user more privacy when online.",
      "He also recommends cookie-blockers and selecting web browsers with privacy controls.",
      "What you need to know about cookiesWhat is a VPN service?",
      "What you need to know about cookies",
      "What is a VPN service?",
      "\"The underlying solution remains that we must keep the pressure on our governments to have strong laws to protect everyone,\" Mr Hosein says.",
      "Karen Renaud is a computing scientist at the University of Strathclyde  working on security and privacy.",
      "Last year she studied 15 privacy policy documents, which lay out what a company is going to do with your data.",
      "She found that the most complicated of them would take 32 minutes to read and would require college-level education to understand.",
      "\"The situation is pretty dire,\" she says.",
      "She advises it's a good idea to clear out the cookies on your browser from time to time, and reduce the cookies you accept.",
      "\"Also, you can stop some tracking. Google, for example, makes it possible to prevent tracking of your searches.\"",
      "Some people turn to services such as DeleteMe and Surfshark, which help remove personal information from data brokers.",
      "Amanda Unterreiner, product manager at US-based data removal service DeleteMe, says high-profile individuals like video gamers and judges use their service as a safety measure.",
      "\"In the case of judges\u2026 because if they're announcing some decision, someone might show up at their house.\"",
      "She also mentions the case of the killing earlier last year of United Healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson.",
      "\"Stories like that kind of spark regular people to think I better get protected.\"",
      "Ms Unterreiner went through the process of having her data removed when she joined the company.",
      "\"You could see every other place I had ever lived, every phone number I've ever had, every email address, on the first page of Google. If someone wanted to steal my identity\u2026 they would be able to cause some real personal damage.\"",
      "The company also offers a service to mask your house on Google Maps.",
      "\"You can look at street view, but that particular property will just be kind of very pixelated.\"",
      "There's multiple reasons why Saam Collingwood, who lives near Stratford-upon-Avon, has cut back her online profile over the years.",
      "The first was following an incident at work where she had included her personal Facebook account on an email to a client and her employer was unhappy.",
      "\"They were able to see photos from a night out,\" she says. \"That didn't go down too well.\"",
      "In another incident she was trolled by a stranger online after posting a video of herself learning a dance routine on YouTube.",
      "Plus, rising online fraud convinced her to further reduce her online profile.",
      "She hasn't completely erased her online presence but she no longer posts regularly on Facebook, reducing it about twice a year.",
      "\"I don't like it when people tag me, people knowing I'm not at home. Most times I remove the tag.\"",
      "She says she has upgraded her anti-virus and security software with a service from online security firm Norton.",
      "\"I wanted to make sure websites weren't taking my details. It makes me more comfortable.\"",
      "But are there any downsides to not being so present online?",
      "\"I miss seeing old friends [on Facebook] and people I would contact once or twice year,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Mr Kaziukonis says it's common to hear people say they don't care about privacy but he believes this is a flawed argument.",
      "\"They say I have nothing to hide. But would they mind sharing every single email they have sent? We have curtains at home, we want to feel private. It's human nature.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The controversial cafe chain is expanding outside London but locals often have mixed feelings.",
    "story": [
      "There is a cheerful red awning and a newly painted cream wooden shopfront on the market square in Macclesfield.",
      "A new bakery cafe has just opened, offering ciabatta and sourdough loaves as well as hot cross buns, syrupy cakes, vegetable quiches and of course coffee.",
      "Like towns around the UK, Macclesfield has struggled with retailers closing, leaving empty stores, so there is a buzz around the new arrival.",
      "But Gail's, a brand that started in London more than 20 years ago, is controversial. It draws crowds and inspires social media memes, but attracts fierce criticism too.",
      "A recent spate of national media coverage has even asked why some people \"hate\" Gail's so much, focusing on everything from who owns it to what it does with unsold pastries.",
      "Its arrival isn't universally popular here either.",
      "\"We don't need another coffee shop,\" says Linda Willdig. She is out shopping with her friend Nicola Tomlinson, who agrees. \"There are too many,\" says Nicola.",
      "In fact, from a table outside the new Gail's you could easily throw a cinnamon bun and hit both a Caffe Nero and a Costa. Greggs is just around the corner too.",
      "So something different might have been better, says Jane Kent, a community nurse.",
      "\"People will be larding out on all the bakery stuff,\" she says. \"We don't need more pastries.\"",
      "At heart, though, the objections to Gail's are not about what it sells, but that it doesn't really belong, that it will push up prices and put independent cafes out of business.",
      "But Stephanie Lamb, a teacher on maternity leave, is more welcoming.",
      "\"I don't know Gail's, so it's not necessarily a chain to me,\" she says. \"I'm just happy to have something extra in town.\"",
      "She likes a latte and a croissant and somewhere she can read a book for an hour.",
      "At Gail's prices that would set her back \u00a36.50. Yes, it's pricey, she says, but she is still planning to \"give it a whirl\".",
      "Gail's - a name that suggests a traditional, single-owner, cafe - favours attractive old buildings, often ones vacated as bank branches close, especially if it is a corner site that means it's more visible to passers by.",
      "It has 170 outlets mostly clustered in London and the south east. But this year it plans to open around 40 more, including Ely, Cambridgeshire later this month, Bath in April, and Buxton, Derbyshire in May.",
      "At Friday's opening in Macclesfield there was a flurry of interest in the new place on the square.",
      "Even in the wake of the cost of living crisis, we are increasingly choosing a coffee out as a treat. Nearly two-thirds of people said they went to a coffee shop more than once a week, according to World Coffee Portal, spending more than \u00a36 per visit on average.",
      "So coffee shops are weathering the tough economic climate better than most businesses. There are now 11,450 branded chain outlets across the UK, up from 9,800 five years ago.",
      "Speciality chains like Black Sheep Coffee, Coffee#1 and Blank Street are springing up in city centres, while the giants like Costa and Starbucks are opening drive-throughs and outlets in retail parks.",
      "Caffe Nero has bought up several smaller chains, in different parts of the country, and is retaining their independent branding so it can make the most of local loyalties.",
      "With enthusiasm for coffee so strong it's something of a mystery to Gail's chief executive Tom Molnar why people object to his chain. He feels misunderstood.",
      "Mr Molnar - a joint owner with private equity backing - has been working on expanding the brand since he joined in 2003, but says it's not just about coffee. Its role as a neighbourhood bakery - baking fresh in-store and in regional bakery hubs every day - is key.",
      "He's hoping to roll Gail's out to many more neighbourhoods, including less affluent ones.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be posh,\" he insists.",
      "But for now they pick very carefully where to open, using an algorithm to help select the most promising postcodes.",
      "It flags up things like whether there is a local butcher, bookshops, a park, schools, churches or a farmers' market.",
      "\"I prefer a place that's evolving and growing rather than some place that's too established,\" he says.",
      "If the algorithm homes in on a particular High Street it is a vote of confidence in that town's future.",
      "But retail experts warn that the very nature of the places that Gail's is picking means there are likely to be accusations of gentrification, increasing prices and rents for existing businesses and residents.",
      "\"Gail's is moving into areas with strong local identities. And when that happens, there will always be a reaction,\" says Kate Hardcastle, founder of Insight with Passion.",
      "\"It's not just about a bakery opening, I think it's also about what it represents.",
      "\"Some will see it as a sign of investment and revitalisation, while others worry it's another step back to our High Streets looking like carbon copies of each other,\" she says.",
      "In Flour, Water, Salt - a direct rival to Gail's selling sourdough bread, bagels, coffee-iced buns and sausage rolls - that is just yards from the new shop, some loyal customers are adamantly opposed to the newcomer.",
      "\"Gail's isn't welcome here,\" says Karen Pearson, a businesswoman who lives just outside Macclesfield. She and her friends are worried that the arrival of Gail's means the town is \"on the up\", when in fact they would rather it \"stayed like it is\".",
      "They're not keen on big corporations coming into the town, concerned they might squeeze out independents.",
      "But firefighter and local councillor Anthony Harrison, reckons Gail's is no match for a place like Flour, Water, Salt. \"It's just a posh Greggs,\" he says.",
      "Independents may not be as under threat as people fear, says Graham Soult, a retail consultant from the north of England.",
      "Local owners can offer a more personal touch, respond to local tastes and demands,  he says, while it can be hard for chains to deviate from their given formula.",
      "\"I think a lot of independents are really adept at navigating all the things that are thrown at them,\" he says.",
      "Despite difficult times, the number of independent coffee shops has risen over the last five years from 11,700 to around 12,400 now.",
      "Flour, Water, Salt's manager Toby Johnstone isn't worried. It could mean more footfall, with more people trying his shop too.",
      "\"We are happy there's something else opening and keeping the town centre going,\" he says. \"It's good to have competition.\""

      "An ornate platter of food catches the corner of my eye.",
      "\"That is a seafood tower as a welcome food amenity, as well as caviar, and you can also see the champagne there for guests to enjoy,\" says Dana Pouwels, head of airport lounge benefits at US bank Chase.",
      "She is showing me around Chase's new Sapphire Lounge at New York's La Guardia Airport.",
      "This is what waiting to catch a flight can look like these days \u2013 if you can afford to pay $550 (\u00a3433) a year to have the correct credit card required to gain entry.",
      "Then once inside Chase's new La Guardia lounge you can then choose to pay up to $3,000 to access a private suite for a few hours.",
      "BBC Business Daily: the battle of the VIP lounges",
      "It is all part of what has been described as a global arms race among the credit card companies that you are probably entirely unaware of \u2013 they are competing to outdo each other with bigger, better, bolder airport lounges.",
      "And while most of us don't have access to these lounges, experts say we are almost certainly helping pay for them. And they don't come cheap.",
      "\"Yes, it's an arms race, and they're getting extraordinary,\" says Clint Thompson, the news editor at the flight and travel website The Points Guy. \"From what we do know, we're talking up to tens of millions of dollars per lounge.",
      "\"Like the new [American Express-owned] Centurion lounge in Atlanta, I believe they spent about $100m to make that happen.\"",
      "Airport lounges aren't a new concept, and credit card issuers have long teamed up with airlines to offer branded credit cards with lounge access.",
      "But now the card issuers are building lounges themselves, as a way of directly appealing to card holders - and potential new customers too.",
      "JP Morgan Chase, American Express, Capital One, they're all now in the lounge - and lifestyle - business.",
      "For American Express this includes opening a high-end lounge in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Its Centurion New York venue is located on the 55th floor of a skyscraper, with floor to ceiling windows offering sweeping views of New York, and fine dining and private bars.",
      "It's designed for Centurion card holders \u2013 a card which will cost you $10,000 as a signing on fee, plus $5,000 a year. And it is invite-only to get one.",
      "\"We're more than a credit card company or a charge card company, it's more a lifestyle brand, getting you special access to concerts, getting you into restaurants,\" says Audrey Hendley, the head of global travel at American Express.",
      "The card issuers have even moved into a 21st Century staple, the coffee shop.",
      "Capital One have Capital One Caf\u00e9s - now you have a barista in a bank.",
      "Their branch in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington DC has all the classic signs of the hip coffee shop - exposed vents, bare brick walls, barista coffee machine.",
      "The only immediate giveaway you might be in the bank is the neon Capital One sign on the wall and their branded touch screens. Look a bit closer, and you might spot one of their casually dressed people who looks like a customer, but is actually what Capital One calls their ambassadors, here to welcome you in and help you with all your banking needs.",
      "Anyone can use the caf\u00e9, but hold a Capital One card and you get money off your brew.",
      "\"We're creating a showroom for our products,\" says Shaun Rowley the director of Capital One Cafes.",
      "\"For customers to come in and see Capital One in action, to touch it, to smell it and even taste it with our cafes. And watching them walk out, as you know, raving fans and advocates for us is kind of the return that we're looking for.\"",
      "None of this sounds like the sort of language you hear normally hear from financial institutions.",
      "Dan Bennett is the head of behavioural science the ad giant Ogilvy. He says this is all about brands tapping into how people think about themselves, and other people.",
      "\"Yeah, it is a piece of plastic with the chip in it that holds your money, but it is something that actually gives you a position in society,\" he says. \"It is something that says something about who you are. It is something that can make you feel elevated.",
      "\"The credit card firms are not just building rooms at airports, they're building a sense of self. It's kind of amazing that financial services companies have managed to kind of look at some deep-core human drivers, and then build experiences around that.",
      "\"And that's why they're so successful with them, because they've managed to find the psychological levers to pull, rather than just looking at the world through a rational lens.\"",
      "But even if you're never going to get access to these places, you are ultimately still paying for them, according to Lulu Wang. He's assistant professor of finance at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago, and has studied how card payment systems work.",
      "He points out that credit cards are more expensive for merchants, be they retailers, or bars and restaurants to accept than debit cards as they incur a higher processing fee.",
      "Prof Wang says merchants are likely to put up prices to cover the additional cost of people using credit cards.",
      "\"We typically think that corporations, you know, they're facing higher costs, they're going to pass on a pretty substantial share of those costs onto consumers,\" he explains.",
      "\"If we impose all these costs on the merchant, it ends up being a cost that is ultimately borne by all of us as consumers. Well-off people get to use the high merchant fee, high reward cards, and then it's the rest of society that has to bear that cost.\"",

    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump.",
      "Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013.",
      "He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job.",
      "But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States.",
      "But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month.",

      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University.",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament.",
      "His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister."

      "Not directly, of course. Rather, it was the two Nordic nations' response to the invasion that turned fear into hope.",
      "Both countries applied for membership of the Western defence alliance Nato in May 2022, some three months after the winter invasion.",
      "Less than three years later, they're both full members and already reaping the benefits, in terms of both national security and economics.",
      "\"We're no longer a country that cannot be trusted,\" observes Micael Johansson, chief executive of Swedish defence company Saab, in reference to the nation's previous historic neutrality.",
      "He points out that in the year since Sweden joined Nato in March 2024, Saab has already negotiated framework agreements with the Nato Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The NSPA is the body that organises Nato's ordering from defence firms.",
      "Mr Johansson adds it is now much easier to gain insights into what's going on inside the alliance. \"We couldn't access NSPAs before,\" he says.",
      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",
      "In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out.",
      "What is Nato and how much do members spend on defence?",
      "Jeremy Bowen: Trump-Zelensky row signals looming crisis between Europe and US",
      "Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine",
      "And while the White House this week announced a pause in US military aid to Ukraine, European leaders have declared they're in it for the long haul, so here too we can expect substantial and ongoing spending on arms.",
      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donald Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with its obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",
      "\"The US really protects its own defence industry, and we should do the same in Europe,\" he says, as he welcomes \"fierce competition\" between commercial defence companies.",
      "Much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defence industry, however.",
      "Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato.",
      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",
      "Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free.",
      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",
      "Nato's newest members believe they could teach other allied countries a thing or two about defence. They clearly offer new perspectives both on how defence spending should be measured. And perhaps also on how civilian society and private enterprise can play their parts.",

      "Pride and hurt.",
      "\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "He is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.",
      "The character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.",
      "Making a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.",
      "\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.",
      "There was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.",
      "The final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.",
      "That's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.",
      "This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Avoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says.",
      "The show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.",
      "\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.",
      "'I never lose hope'",
      "Mo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".",
      "\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.",
      "There was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.",
      "\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.",
      "\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"",
      "The show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.",
      "It tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.",
      "From his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Mo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.",
      "The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.",
      "Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what is widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.",
      "Israel occupied the areas in the 1967 Middle East war and built settlements, which are considered illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.",
      "Palestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.",
      "\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.",
      "He adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.",
      "Mo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.",
      "He says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.",
      "\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"",
      "Mo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.",
      "\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.",
      "\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"",
      "Mo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".",
      "\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,\" he says.",
      "\"Those that agree with me or disagree with me\u2026 it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.\"",

      "In May 1912, the New York Dramatic Mirror said Finlayson had \"an excellent opportunity, which he did not miss, for developing two characters in his one role - the simple, naive Scotsman and the artful, determined detective\".",
      "It added: \"The remarkable thing is that he managed to do them both at the same time.\"",
      "He took on another Scottish character in the Broadway production of Bunty Pulls the Strings, but pulled out of the national tour in 1916 when Hollywood beckoned.",
      "By 1919 he was signed with the \"King of Comedy\" Mack Sennet, appearing as a Keystone Cop and lauded as a \"legitimate and screen player of international celebrity\".",
      "After a move to Hal Roach at Culver City in 1923, Finlayson was tested in different billings, sometimes in a lead role or as one of a comic trio with up-and-coming comics Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.",
      "He eventually found his niche as their established comic support or antagonist.",
      "By the time he died aged 66 in 1953, he had more than 100 film credits to his name and his eccentric mannerisms were internationally recognised.",
      "The double-take, the squint then a one-eyed stare and raised eyebrow - Finlayson's madcap facial expressions became his trademark, along with the drawn-out \"dohhhh\".",
      "It inspired Dan Castellaneta when he voiced Homer in The Simpsons, which first aired in 1989.",

      "When asked why Sir Terry enjoyed working with him, he recalled: \"Terry would tell me: 'You are the person I distrust the least in the publishing business'.\"",
      "\"The trouble is I was spoilt. I was exceptionally lucky that I was the individual he distrusted least,\" said Mr Smythe, now 83.",
      "Sir Terry first showed Mr Smythe his fiction work in the summer of 1968 and the publisher was immediately struck by his \"brilliance, sense of humour and his skill at writing\".",
      "\"At that time publishers were much more prepared to back their hunches,\" he said.",
      "\"This is a person who I did not want to allow to go some place else.\"",

      "That left Sir Terry to focus on his passion of writing.",
      "\"He didn't write as often as I would like. He would tend to write during winter evenings. In the summer evenings he preferred gardening,\" he said.",
      "\"He could write fast. He always worked on the idea that he would do at least 400 words a day. As it evolved he might do more, maybe 400 words before breakfast.\"",
      "Mr Smythe admitted he was occasionally chastised for making deals worth \"too much money\".",
      "He said: \"On one occasion... two publishers competed. Each came up with one price and I rang up Terry and said: 'They have offered me \u00a3750,000'.",

      "\"He used to say: 'Truth be told, I shall tell them I would pay to be allowed to write.'",

    "summary": "The actor may not have known his wife was dead inside the home he was living in because of the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Gene Hackman was alone.",
      "The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.",
      "Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.",
      "If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.",
      "Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.",
      "The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.",
      "Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation.",
      "Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.",
      "But a police investigation found no foul play.",
      "Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.",
      "\"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife.",
      "She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.",
      "\"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.",
      "Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.",
      "Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner.",
      "At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.",
      "Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said.",
      "His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself.",
      "Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.",
      "\"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said.",
      "Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it.",
      "\"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\"",
      "Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling.",
      "He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation.",
      "The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face.",
      "His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.",
      "\"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\"",
      "Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.",
      "\"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.",
      "Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.",
      "Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.",

    "summary": "The Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni feud has shone a light on a part of the entertainment industry that many of those within it would rather remain invisible.",
    "story": [
      "The lawsuits between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni have shed light on a secretive group of people in Hollywood who operate behind the scenes to keep a lid on fallouts and scandals. But in recent years their role has shifted - and their challenges multiplied",
      "Listen to Steven read this article.",
      "\"She's a phony, but I guess the public likes that\u2026\" This is the line that actress Joan Crawford is said to have declared about film star Bette Davis.",
      "The back-and-forth sniping between the pair played out in public in the 1930s and 40s. \"Bette is a survivor... She survived herself,\" Crawford also apparently remarked.",
      "Their tempestuous relationship was so notorious that in 2017 it was made into an Emmy award-winning TV series, Feud.",
      "Hollywood rivalries are of course nothing new \u2013 yet conflicts today rarely play out so publicly. That might be why the dispute between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, which spilled out into the open in December 2024, is still in the headlines three months on.",
      "The subsequent legal battle brought to light a fallout during production of the film It Ends With Us. After the promotional and cinematic run had ended, the pair \u2013 who didn't appear on the red carpet together at the premiere in New York \u2013 filed lawsuits against each other.",
      "Lively has accused Baldoni and others of carrying out a smear campaign against her after she complained about alleged sexual harassment on set. Baldoni, meanwhile, has accused Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist of carrying out a smear campaign against him, and claims that she tried to take over control of the film. Both sides deny all allegations.",
      "What emerged as this all played out is that crisis PR managers had been employed. Legal representatives for Lively obtained numerous text messages between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and the crisis team he retained, led by Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake. Ms Nathan was alleged to have texted Ms Abel, \"You know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "Lively has now reportedly taken on the CIA's former deputy chief of staff Nick Shapiro to advise on her legal communications strategy.",
      "While the outcomes of the lawsuits remain to be seen, the feud has cast the spotlight on an industry that would ordinarily remain largely invisible: that is, the publicity machine at work behind the scenes in Hollywood.",
      "\"On every set, there are fights, liaisons\u2026 there are all sorts of things that go on,\" explains Richard Rushfield, founder and columnist at Hollywood newsletter The Ankler. \"Hollywood is a world full of very messy people coming together for these giant projects, where they put together teams quickly to make these things and disband immediately after.",
      "\"Between all that a lot of stuff goes on, and they deal with it quietly \u2013 they're very obsessive about controlling the narrative. When this stuff explodes into the public, beyond control, it makes everyone very nervous.\"",
      "But the world of the Hollywood PR has shifted in recent years, partly because of the growth of social media, which has changed the relationship between celebrities and fans, bringing them into direct contact and removing some of the mystique.",
      "So, what does that mean for the people whose job it is to keep a lid on the industry's messy reality?",
      "From Tom Hardy to Sarah Jessica Parker",
      "Few fallouts have spilled out into the open in recent years \u2013 and those that did were picked over simply because they're so rare. Actor Dwayne Johnson revealed \"a fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating\" with his Fast & Furious co-star Vin Diesel, in a 2018 interview.",
      "The stars of another action film, Mad Max: Fury Road, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, are reported to have filmed many of their scenes separately.",
      "And then there were the alleged tensions between Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker, who were co-stars of Sex and the City, which ran for six years. In 2018, after Parker offered condolences for Cattrall's brother's death, Cattrall responded on social media, calling Parker a \"hypocrite\" and stating, \"You are not my family. You are not my friend.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hundreds of other spats will never see the light of day. \"Some of a publicist's best work may never be seen,\" says Daniel Bee, a publicist and brand consultant based in Los Angeles, \"because it stopped something that was wrong, or re-crafted something to a different narrative, or pointed the light in a different direction.",
      "\"The most interesting stuff I've ever done as a publicist is the stuff nobody will ever know about.\"",
      "'Powerful forces at play'",
      "Since Daniel Bee started out as an entertainment publicist in 1997, he has observed a shift in the wider industry. \"I started my career in the British media, there were 11 national newspapers competing with each other. It was a bear pit, hard work, and it was getting to know individuals via relationships.",
      "\"Now, you're up against an anonymous algorithm and accounts where you don't know who you're up against. It's harder to control than ever before.\"",
      "Certainly, social media has posed challenges for those attempting to control narratives around major films and their stars \u2013 while also heralding new forms of \"dark arts\" through which publicists can attempt to shape opinion.",
      "Dating apps could be in trouble \u2013 here's what might take their place",
      "Nasa needs saving from itself \u2013 but is this billionaire right for that job?",
      "Sneaky Britain? How our moral compasses are changing",
      "\"There has always been an army of advisors and consultants doing PR voodoo,\" says Eriq Gardner, entertainment law expert and founding partner of Puck News. \"While I'd love to say the public is media-literate and savvy enough to read between the lines to see the spin, the truth is there are a lot of powerful forces at play and sometimes a large amount of misinformation.\"",
      "So-called PR voodoo is different now that a celebrity \u2013 or their fans \u2013 can access an audience of millions with a click.",
      "While the publicists of previous eras might only have had to worry about print and broadcast platforms, smartphones and social media mean today's digital landscape is a wild west where anyone can shape their own narrative. A badly judged post or comment can damage an actor's career.",
      "But the flipside is a whole new medium in which PRs can practise their \"voodoo\".",
      "Astroturfing and ways to 'cause mischief'",
      "One of the tactics is \"astroturfing\" \u2013 or disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous up-swelling of public opinion.",
      "This works by manipulating public opinion and creating a false impression of grassroots support (hence the name) or opposition, often coordinated through social media accounts in a way that seems organic.",
      "The practice isn't new, but has been given new life with the advent of social media algorithms.",
      "\"It's deliberately planting disinformation, or twisted versions of the truth, in certain sections of social media,\" says Carla Speight, founder of the PR Mastery app. \"The aim is the halfway point of influential where they will get a bit of traction, but so that it's not too obvious \u2013 you wouldn't hire a Kardashian to do it.",
      "\"It's built up in layers,\" she continues. \"It's like playing a very sinister game of chess. You're putting all the pieces in the right places, just the right amount of mixed-up information, and then you just watch it explode.\"",
      "Although the posts might appear to be genuine public opinion, in fact it's a faked crowd \u2013 whether that's made up of bots or real people, who can be paid to coordinate their posts.",
      "\"All it takes is one or two people to create a meme and put it with the right people,\" says Ms Speight. \"It needs to appear as a trend, and then it's gone. Something is dripped here, something else over there, and when it's done well\u2026 it causes a bit of mischief.\"",
      "Reinventing an age-old tactic?",
      "But all of this is simply a new platform for an age-old trend that has been going on long before the advent of social media, according to Mr Bee. \"Undetected smear campaigns have always been a thing,\" he points out.",
      "\"Previously it would have been a publicist whispering to a diarist of a national newspaper. The issue with digital media is it's anonymous and untraceable.\"",
      "What has changed, he continues, is that audiences have become savvier. \"Whereas before, a quite subservient audience would just take what was given to them in the media, with natural scepticism, curiosity, and a greater level of information, I think people use more critical thinking.\"",
      "Eriq Gardner is less convinced: \"I'm not sure the public approaches what they read with enough scepticism.\"",
      "And yet those in the industry are often alert to it. According to Ms Speight, \"Usually, there's a distinct sort of tell, and it may be the PR thing where we have 'spidey senses' and we can sort of see it, but you're asking, 'Where has that come from? Who started that?' And when there's never a specific place to point it to, that's usually a tell-tale sign.\"",
      "The Hollywood ecosystem",
      "What's clear, though, is that, with studios providing some publications with significant advertising revenue, as well as supplying talent for special events and front covers, revelations often emerge elsewhere in the media.",
      "\"When [scandals] come out, it's usually from places outside of Hollywood,\" argues Mr Rushfield. \"The Harvey Weinstein story was broken by The New York Times and the New Yorker.\"",
      "It was The New York Times that first reported Lively's legal complaint in December. \"It's one of the few places that can afford to do that, and then everyone else jumped in so nobody was sticking their neck out.\" Baldoni filed a $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times in December, although a federal judge indicated this week that it might be dismissed.",
      "Even when bigger outlets break news about Hollywood disputes, the growing dominance of social media means that stories might not have the same cut-through they had previously.",
      "Doreen St Felix, a writer who was previously an editor on Lena Dunham's newsletter, recently wrote in The New Yorker that stories of harassment and abuse, for example, now receive a \"curdled, cynical, and exhausted reception\" \u2013 this, less than a decade after the emergence of the MeToo movement.",
      "She went on to claim that: \"The late 2010s genre of #MeToo reportage cannot thrive on today's volatile internet. Information is misinformation and vice versa. Victims are offenders and offenders are victims.\"",
      "Sometimes, however, the best way for publicists to prevent stories being amplified is by bypassing social media entirely when reacting to a scandal.",
      "\"If you give it to the press first, they don't quote as many of the comments on social media,\" says Ms Speight. \"You control the narrative completely, because the comments come afterwards.\"",
      "Mr Rushfield points out that very little of the revelations in the entertainment press comes out because someone \"uncovered\" something. \"Almost everything you read is there because somebody placed it there \u2013 somebody is dictating a story.\"",
      "What viewers want",
      "None of this industry would exist if the appetite weren't there and if the viewing public didn't want to unpick details about their lives \u2013 and rifts. And yet attitudes towards celebrity have undoubtedly changed since the advent of social media.",
      "\"It's now a two-way communication, which it never was before,\" points out Mr Bee. \"It was generally celebrities, or lawyer or government or whatever, just saying something that gets reported, and that message is conveyed. Now, you have to be prepared for a two-way conversation.\"",
      "But he thinks there are different attitudes to the media today than in the era of celebrity gossip magazines. Nodding to the UK, he continues: \"We had the Leveson Inquiry, we're about to get an ITV drama about phone hacking \u2013 it's as if the curtain has been lifted.\"",
      "As for the Lively and Baldoni lawsuits, it's not clear how these will play out \u2013 but the very fact that it has so unusually spilled into the public domain is a reminder of how well-oiled the Hollywood publicity machine is the rest of the time. And that is unlikely to change soon.",

    "summary": "Stars like Charli XCX have made see-through outfits all the rage at big events, but not everyone's a fan.",
    "story": [
      "Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks.",
      "At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom.",
      "She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,\" she said. \"I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\"",
      "The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress.",
      "The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo.",
      "At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath.",
      "Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show.",
      "Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too.",
      "As Vogue wrote in January: \"For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season.\"",
      "Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes.",
      "Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as \"demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes\".",
      "The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing \"a strappy white top with no bra\".",
      "Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again.",
      "The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The \"free the nipple\" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014.",
      "Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. \"Stop policing women's bodies,\" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so \"why is society judging?\"",
      "But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints  about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance.",
      "\"Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,\" one person wrote on social media.",
      "'Challenging fashion norms'",
      "Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a \"provocative statement\", but says it's a \"way to reclaim the right to govern one's body\".",
      "The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds.",
      "Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend \"is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion\".",
      "The idea of freeing the nipple \"isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms\", he argues.",
      "\"Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers.\"",
      "It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars.",
      "Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though.",
      "At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty.",
      "There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress.",
      "\"This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,\" the New York Times noted.",
      "However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because \"it's only women who do this\".",
      "\"It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,\" she wrote.",
      "Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit.",
      "It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",

    "summary": "As she returns to pop with her seventh album, Mayhem, Lady Gaga reflects on the loneliness of fame.",
    "story": [
      "No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star.",
      "Just ask Lady Gaga.",
      "Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs.",
      "Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was \"speed-running Madonna's entire career\".",
      "And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off \"for fashion\".",
      "When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed.",
      "On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion.",
      "\"I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,\" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two.",
      "\"I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\"",
      "Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her.",
      "\"I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.\"",
      "The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time.",
      "In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pav\u00e9 band.",
      "But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one.",
      "\"Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,\" she reveals.",
      "\"A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?'",
      "\"And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'.\"",
      "It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017.",
      "\"There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,\" she recalls of Polansky's proposal.",
      "\"To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.\"",
      "Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem.",
      "Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a \"lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns\", and the promise of love in a time of darkness.",
      "She calls it a \"thank you\" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too.",
      "Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook.",
      "Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fianc\u00e9 who'd nudged her in that direction.",
      "\"He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',\" she said.",
      "\"On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,\" Polansky added. \"I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.\"",
      "'Angriest song'",
      "With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way.",
      "On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the \"roma-ma-ma\" gibberish of Bad Romance \u2013 although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, \"morta-ooh-Gaga\".",
      "In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself.",
      "There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created.",
      "It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, \"I became a notorious being\" \u2013 a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity.",
      "\"That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge.",
      "\"It kind of took me down.\"",
      "How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life?",
      "\"I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,\" she says.",
      "\"The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice.",
      "\"I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show.",
      "\"That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.\"",
      "In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing.",
      "Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from \"Lady Gaga\" but from other producers and writers in her orbit.",
      "\"When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me.",
      "\"So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.\"",
      "From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase.",
      "Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel.",
      "It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career.",
      "\"This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,\" she says.",
      "\"I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music.",
      "\"I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.\"",
      "As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK.",
      "Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a \"heroin addict\" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses \u2013 an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee.",
      "Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist.",
      "But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm.",
      "She puts that ease down to \"growing up and living a full life\".",
      "\"Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fianc\u00e9 - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona.\"",
      "With an air of finality, she adds: \"I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop.",

      "There could be a \"milder cohort\" who may not need hospital treatment but still suffer symptoms such as \"nausea and vomiting\", she added.",

      "Dr Sally Anne Wilson, chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine's safer care committee, told BBC Breakfast: \"As a parent you want to make sensible decisions for what you buy your child and if you're not aware that there's glycerol in the slushie and what that can do, then you're not going to have any qualms about buying the said slushie.\"",
      "Dr Wilson said age-based advice on the drinks is difficult because there's a variation in children's weight, but added \"there's definitely an argument\" for increasing the minimum age because it would solve that problem.",
      "One reason for the recent rise in children becoming ill may be the lower sugar content of the slushies, which is attractive to parents, the study says.",
      "In countries with no sugar tax, they contain much more glucose and often no glycerol at all, the authors say.",
      "Rebecca Sudworth, director of policy at the Food Standards Agency, said it was considering the finding of the review \"carefully\".",
      "\"We continue to strongly encourage parents to follow [our] advice which is that slushie drinks should not be given to children under four years old. Retailers are also advised to make parents fully aware of this guidance.\"",

    "story": [
      "LED technology has been used to address a number of skin issues, such as eczema, mild to moderate acne, psoriasis and sun damage in a medical setting.",
      "But the at-home LED market is on the verge of becoming a massive industry - with masks and other devices retailing for anything from \u00a340 to \u00a31,500.",
      "The technology harnesses the power of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which then stimulate skin cells when they are exposed to the skin repeatedly.",
      "Mask developers make big claims that at-home LED masks can be used to treat acne scars, sun damage and fine lines - but does this stand up to scrutiny?",
      "The LED market is set to be worth \u00a3600m globally by 2032 - which is nearly double what airflow technology like the Dyson Airwrap will be worth at the same point.",
      "According to consultant dermatologist Dr Jonathan Kentley, LED technology works by causing the skin to absorb light energy, which then triggers cellular changes in a process known as photobiomodulation (PBM).",
      "\"This allows new blood vessels and skin cells to be formed, along with more collagen and elastin,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"PBM has also been used to treat acne as it has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the amount of oil in the skin,\" he adds.",
      "A recent comprehensive study of PBM stated that more clinical trials on humans need to take place to fully understand how it actually works.",
      "US space agency Nasa first began studying the effect of LEDs in the 1990s to see if it could help in cell regeneration.",
      "Since then, medical-grade devices have been used by dermatologists \"for many years\", according to Dr Kentley.",
      "But at-home masks have only been on the retail market for about five years and cost a fraction of the medical devices.",
      "The main differences between medical devices and High Street masks are the strength of the LEDs, the number of bulbs on the device and how close they sit to the skin's surface when being used.",
      "LED therapy masks are 'visually interesting'",
      "Dr Justine Kluk, who runs her own dermatology clinic and specialises in treating acne, believes that while at-home masks \"sound promising\", mask wholesale manufacturers are \"speculating\" about their benefits.",
      "\"I don't believe anyone has run clinical trials of the LED mask at home to see if it is the same dose as a device you would use in a clinic or hospital,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"No-one is testing these devices in big enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time for us to feel really confident.",
      "\"So I believe the benefits from using one of these masks is probably very modest,\" she adds.",
      "Skincare makes up nearly half of all global sales in the beauty industry - and is set to continue to grow more than the likes of haircare, make-up and fragrance in the next year.",
      "This is being boosted by Generation Z (those born between 1995 and 2009) and even Generation Alpha (born 2010 to now) whose skincare fascination is said to be fuelled by social media trends.",
      "Dr Kluk says she has noticed \"that people's interest in at-home skin care and treatments has increased hugely since Covid\" and believes the \"visually interesting\" element of the at-home LED mask makes it such an eye-catching product to sell online.",
      "\"People sitting watching TV wearing a red LED mask increases people's curiosity.",
      "\"Every other consultation I've had for the last six months, has involved people asking me about LED masks,\" she adds.",
      "When you search LED masks on social media platforms such as TikTok, you will be met with hundreds of videos with users showing off their results after using one of these at-home devices.",
      "Natalie O'Neill, 29, tells the BBC she started to use a mask \"out of curiosity to see if I would notice any difference\" and did not use it to treat an existing skin condition like acne.",
      "The skincare content creator says:  \"I noticed a change in my skin after a couple of weeks and felt it prevented breakouts really well.\"",
      "She adds that the mask has helped to \"keep my skin tone looking more even\" and faded marks on her face more quickly.",
      "O'Neill was not paid to promote a particular mask and caveats all her content on this technology by saying she uses it alongside a consistent skincare routine.",
      "\"Getting red light or LED therapy in a clinic is not immediately transferable to a mask, which a lot of consumers don't realise - I'm OK with that because I have the right expectations,\" she adds.",
      "Part of the appeal of LED masks is that they are easy to use and therefore have a low barrier to entry for potential buyers.",
      "Laurence Newman is the chief executive of CurrentBody, whose at-home LED mask is one of the world's best sellers.",
      "He started selling professional equipment to clinics more than 25 years ago and began developing an at-home LED mask in 2009, bringing out the company's first device just under 10 years later.",
      "\"We see that people use it for 10 minutes and get an instant glow afterwards,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Newman says that women in particular \"are moving towards totally non-invasive skincare\" and looking for ways to improve their skin without botox and fillers.",
      "Newman says the masks his company sells have been developed using the same technology as medical devices, which have a minimum requirement light wavelengths.",
      "He emphasises that the at-home LED mask market and indeed at-home beauty technology market are in their infancy, with \"a real movement of education\" growing.",
      "'This is a lot of money to spend'",
      "Dr Kentley concludes that \"PBM is mostly considered safe, even at high levels\" so using any form of LED technology is unlikely to \"cause damage to cells\", however more research into how exactly PBM works is needed to understand what it can do.",
      "\"There have been many experimental and clinical studies into the use of PBM for various dermatologic conditions, however they have varied in the parameters of the device and treatment protocols,\" he adds.",
      "\"Many of these studies were small and unstandardised and often paid for by the manufacturers so it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions\".",
      "He says if someone is keen to buy a device they should make sure they choose one that has EU safety certifications and a high density of LED bulbs on the mask to ensure enough energy is being delivered to the skin.",
      "Dr Kluk also says that she does not \"want to discourage anyone\" who is intrigued by the technology but wants \"them to understand that this is a lot of money to spend on a device, which could potentially support a good skincare routine, or if it's severe like acne, a good prescription regimen and some lifestyle measures - but it's unlikely to do enough on its own.\"",

      "\"I don't want them to worry because at the minute I'm alright,\" he explained.",
      "A study by Glasgow University in 2019 found former professional footballers were almost three-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than the general population.",
      "Windass said he wanted to raise awareness of dementia and get players' union the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to increase its support to affected players and their families.",
      "\"The one thing I love about myself is trying to help as many people as I can in any way, shape or form,\" he said.",
      "\"The reason why we've done this [interview] is to help the families, because my family might need help in 10 or 15 years' time. So I don't want them to suffer as well.",

A \"common\" side effect of any medicine can be considered to only affect as few as 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS.",
      "The drugs work by mimicking the behaviour of dopamine, a natural chemical in our brains which helps regulate movement. It is known as the \"happy hormone\" because it is activated when something is pleasurable or we feel rewarded.",
      "But agonist drugs can over-stimulate these feelings and under-stimulate the appreciation of consequences - leading to impulsive behaviour, according to academics.",
      "The cases of what the GSK report from 2003 described as \"deviant behaviour\"  involved two men who were prescribed Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease. In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence.",
      "The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his \"libido problem subsequently resolved\" after his dose was reduced.",
      "In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out \"uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour\". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges \"intensified\" after the treatment.",
      "Prevalence rates of what GSK calls \"deviant\" sexual behaviours caused by the drugs are unknown and tend to be under-reported by those who experience them, according to Valerie Voon, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Cambridge.",
      "\"There's a lot of stigma and shame attached to it, and people don't realise that it's associated with a medication,\" she says.",
      "Prof Voon believes risky sexual behaviours - beyond a purely increased libido - should be specifically warned about and screened by the NHS, because their impact can be \"devastating\".",
      "RLS is believed to affect about one in 20 adults - and women are about twice as likely to suffer as men.",
      "The 20 sufferers we spoke to say not only had doctors failed to tell them of the potentially serious side effects of the drugs, but also failed to review the impact of the medication on their bodies subsequently.",
      "Sarah was in her 50s when she was prescribed another dopamine agonist drug made by a different manufacturer.",
      "\"Previously I'd have had no interest if Brad Pitt walked in the room naked,\" she says. \"But it turned me into this raging woman who kept taking sexual addiction further.\"",
      "Sarah began selling used underwear and videos of sex acts online - and organising telephone sex with strangers. She also began shopping compulsively - ending up with \u00a330,000 of debt.",
      "To combat the effects of the dopamine agonist, she began self-medicating by taking pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills. She ended up being admitted to rehab - but that meant her driving licence was taken away and she lost her job.",
      "\"I turned to things that weren't healthy - I knew that the behaviour wasn't me, but I couldn't control it,\" she tells the BBC.",

      "A third woman, Sue, says she was prescribed two different dopamine agonist drugs without being warned of compulsive behaviour side effects on either occasion. She even mentioned recent gambling behaviour when the second drug was prescribed, she says. She went on to rack up debts of \u00a380,000.",
      "\"The effect on my family was horrific - it was life-changing money to lose,\" she says. \"But at the time I didn't know it was no fault of my own.\"",
      "A class action was brought against GSK in 2011 by four sufferers of Parkinson's disease - the BBC has learned. They said Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships.",
      "They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The class action was settled but GSK denied liability.",
      "Cases of serious side effects have also been reported in other countries, particularly in relation to the use of drugs for Parkinson's disease.",
      "In France, a court awarded damages to a father of two who complained that Ropinirole had given him compulsive homosexual urges, while another man without a criminal record began torturing cats.",
      "In the US, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends the drugs should only be used for short-term treatment, such as end-of-life care.",
      "Many of the women the BBC spoke to also complained that prolonged use of the drugs also worsened their underlying RLS. It meant their dosage had been increased which, in turn, had exacerbated their compulsive behaviour - a process known as augmentation.",
      "Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist, says the drugs still play an important role but he believes that drug companies, health authorities and doctors need to better warn patients of these side effects.",

      "\"As with all medicines, [it] has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information,\" it said.",
      "In response to its 2003 research that had found a link with \"deviant\" sexual behaviour, GSK told us this was shared with health authorities and had informed updates in prescribing information - which now lists \"altered or increased sexual interest\" and \"behaviour of significant concern\" as side effects.",
      "The current patient information leaflet for Ropinirole makes specific reference to changes in sexual interest on five occasions - almost exclusively warning about the frequency or strength of such feelings as potentially \"abnormally high\", \"excessive\" or \"increase[d]\".",
      "The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said that while a specific reference to \"deviant\" sexual behaviour is not included in warnings, such impulses vary and a general warning about activities which may be harmful is included.",
      "It also said that it is important for healthcare professionals to explain the possible risk to patients and not all experience these types of side effects.",

      "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said.",
      "They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals.",
      "The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection.",
      "And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs.",
      "The discovery centres on the proteasome \u2013 a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body.",
      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",
      "It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them.",
      "Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening.",
      "\"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection.",
      "\"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\"",
      "The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics.",
      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",
      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",

      "Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting.",
      "\"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\"",
      "She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\"."

    "story": [
      "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.",
      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",

      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",
      "The 'Time Lords' racing to tackle the threat of GPS jamming",
      "In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on",
      "After White House clash, Starmer faces decision about who he can trust",
      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:57:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The measure is part of the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced to Parliament.",
    "story": [
      "Councils are to be given greater powers to seize land, under government plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "The measure is part of the flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill, which has been introduced in Parliament and aims to speed up building.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said he wanted greater use of compulsory purchase orders (CPOs), which allow public authorities to acquire land without the consent of the owner.",
      "Currently, councils buying sites through CPOs must factor in the \"hope value\" - the potential value if planning permission for development is secured  - and this is set to be axed to allow land to be bought at a lower price.",
      "However, rural campaign groups raised concerns farmers could be forced to sell at knock-down prices and that green spaces could be lost.",
      "Victoria Vyvan, president of the Country Land and Business Association said the \"expensive, slow and bureaucratic planning system\" was what was preventing land sales by her members, who \"strongly believe that a small number of homes should be built in a large number of villages\".",
      "She added: \"In removing hope value from compulsory purchases, the government wants farmers to pay for a housing crisis they didn't create.",
      "\"We doubt house builders contracted by councils will be taking a lower profit, so once again farmers will be the only part of the supply chain to lose out.\"",
      "Paul Miner, head of planning and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said the group supported the use of CPOs to build genuinely affordable homes on previously developed land.",
      "But he added: \"Compulsory purchase shouldn't be used to enable the development of valued countryside and local green spaces.\"",
      "New homes fall again in government's first six months",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Labour would build on green belt to boost housing",
      "Responding to such fears, Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was \"somewhat mystified\" by this interpretation, saying CPOs would be used \"far more often\" for regenerating brownfield - or previously developed - land.",
      "\"We think it's right these powers are more widely used and it will be for local authorities to make the decisions about what land is appropriate for those powers to be used on,\" he added.",
      "A requirement for the secretary of state to sign off on CPOs will be removed \"in certain instances\", he said, adding that the legislation would be \"transformative\" in unlocking construction for new homes, roads, rail and renewable energy projects.",
      "The bill also aims streamline the planning process, with more decisions made directly by officers rather than councillors.",
      "However, councils have raised concerns this could mean they will be shut out of the democratic planning process.",
      "Richard Clewer, housing and planning spokesperson at the Country Councils Network, said he welcomed changes to CPOs as a \"useful tool\".",
      "However, he said changes to the planning process could \"dilute and bypass the role of councillors\", particularly with rural developments where a few new homes could make a significant impact.",
      "Defending the plans, Pennycook said \"expert planning officers\" would support elected councillors with technical detail and allow councillors to focus on larger, more controversial applications.",
      "The government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years, with the pledge key to boosting economic growth.",
      "However, the number of new homes continued to fall during the first six months that Labour was in power, with the construction industry warning the country does not have enough workers to deliver on the target.",
      "Pennycook said the inheritance from the previous Conservative government was \"dire\" but there were \"very positive signs\" and \"green shoots coming forward\" in the number of planning applications being submitted.",
      "Other measures in the bill include:",
      "Up to \u00a32,500 off energy bills for people living within 500m of new pylonsStreamlining the process for approving key projects like wind farms, roads or railways and banning multiple \"meritless\" legal challenges.Allowing \"ready-to-go\" energy projects to jump to the front of the queue for grid connections, replacing the current \"first come, first served process\" which the government says has clogged up the system",

      "He added: \"I am grateful to the work of the Women and Equalities Committee for raising the important issue of miscarriage leave.",
      "\"The loss of a baby at any stage is an incredibly difficult personal experience and the inquiry they conducted demonstrated a clear gap in support for those who experience pregnancy loss and need time to recover and grieve.\"",

      "Vicki Robinson, CEO of the Miscarriage Association, said: \"We are extremely pleased to see, that for the first time ever, those experiencing pre-24-week pregnancy loss will be officially recognised in bereavement leave legislation.",
      "\"While we had been seeking paid leave, and the present commitment appears to be for unpaid leave, it nevertheless represents a significant step forward and provides long-overdue validation that this type of loss can be experienced as a bereavement like any other.\"",

    "story": [
      "Michael Gove has told the Covid inquiry it was \"ludicrous\" to suggest he tried to force through a deal for a new ventilator made by the electronics giant Dyson without proper safety checks.",
      "Emails show a senior official at the health watchdog warned that the former cabinet office minister was trying to \"circumvent the regulatory process\" in March 2020.",
      "Messages between staff at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said Mr Gove did not \"appreciate the level of risk involved\" and was working to a \"totally unrealistic\" timescale.",
      "A provisional order for 10,000 machines was placed at the time, but the deal was scrapped after Dyson failed to win regulatory approval.",
      "No public money was spent on the prototype.",
      "Dyson said it never intended to make a profit from the venture and wrote off around \u00a320m in research and development costs.",
      "Ventilator Challenge",
      "In March 2020, as Covid was spreading across northern Italy, there was a frantic attempt by health authorities to get hold of ventilators to help patients breathe.",
      "The NHS had between 6,000 and 8,000 in stock but modelling suggested it needed 30,000 by the end of June and 90,000 by November to cope with a predicted influx of patients.",
      "On 16 March 2020, the government launched the 'Ventilator Challenge' - a drive to encourage domestic UK suppliers to develop new machines or modify existing designs.",
      "The project was overseen by cabinet office officials and involved the MHRA, which helped draw up initial specifications and squeezed an approval process that would usually take 18-24 months into just weeks.",
      "A number of major companies were involved, including the carmakers Ford and McLaren, and the electronics giant Dyson.",
      "At the time, the company's founder Sir James Dyson held a number of telephone conversations with government officials, including the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",
      "The Covid inquiry was shown WhatsApp messages then sent between ministers and government advisers suggesting Sir James was concerned about the pace of project.",
      "On 20 March 2020, Mr Johnson wrote that \"Dyson [was] freaking\" and called for \"Action this day\".",
      "Minutes later ex health secretary Matt Hancock replied, \"I have also received the same. I will talk to Dyson and Michael [Gove] and sort it.\"",
      "Asked about the deal at the inquiry, the government's then chief commercial officer, Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, said it was the only example he could recall in the pandemic where he was asked to put a contract in place \"against commercial guidance\".",
      "Five days later, on 25 March, Boris Johnson wrote another WhatsApp message to the same group saying that: \"Dyson has a ventilator ready to go\u2026 It's safe, effective and loses less oxygen. Rhys Williams has blocked it under the misapprehension that oxygen passes through the motor. That is total b****cks.\"",
      "He accused officials of \"fiddling while Rome burns\" and added: \"Sorry but I'm on a mission. Dyson knows what he's doing and won't risk his global brand reputation delivering dodgy ventilators.\"",
      "'Totally unrealistic'",
      "Sir Gareth said, at that point, the Dyson prototype pushed air from a fan directly into the lungs of patients, something that could cause safety concerns.",
      "The Dyson team did subsequently \"fix\" that part of the design, he added.",
      "Later on 25 March, Sir Gareth wrote to Sir John Manzoni, a top civil servant in the cabinet office, saying that Michael Gove was \"INSISTENT we place an order with Dyson\u2026 contingent on passing clinical and passing MHRA approvals.\"",
      "A provisional \u00a3100,000 order was then placed for the Dyson prototypes, and an email from Michael Gove's private office set out a number of actions that needed be taken quickly including: \"The MHRA and Sir Gareth Rhys Williams to ensure by the end of Friday, [that] the Dyson product has been tested and approved by MHRA\u2026 [and] the final product has started to be manufactured.\"",
      "The following day Graeme Tunbridge, the director of devices for the MHRA, wrote to colleagues warning that Michael Gove was \"keen to press forward with Dyson's proposal to a timescale that is totally unrealistic.\"",
      "He added that Mr Gove \"did not appreciate the level of risk involved in the manufacture and use of ventilators\" and \"wanted to circumvent the expedited regulatory process that has been put in place\".",
      "\"MHRA are doing everything we can to support this but absolutely will not cut any corners when it comes to the issues of critical patient safety,\" he wrote.",
      "Giving evidence to the inquiry, Mr Gove denied he had tried to pressure the MHRA in any way, or that the focus on Dyson meant resources could not be devoted to bids from other companies.",
      "\"Just imagine the situation, if you will, a minister \u2013 Matt Hancock, I, Boris Johnson \u2013 says we want to have a potentially lethal machine in hospitals deliberately so that we can meet an arbitrary deadline. It's inconceivable,\" he said.",
      "The former minister said that the Dyson prototype ultimately \"did not get through testing\" and \"whenever confronted with brute facts about safety or otherwise, I would always accept them.\"",
      "He denied that his private office was instructing the regulator to approve the device saying the language used was simply \"shorthand for 'we would hope that it had been tested and if tested satisfactorily [then] approved by the MHRA to that timescale'\".",
      "In the end the government said the Ventilator Challenge helped scale up the production of three existing models, and approved one new design by the medical devices firm Penlon.",
      "In total, an extra 14,000 devices were delivered over three months, fewer than the government originally planned for as doctors identified other ways of treating the most severe Covid cases.",
      "In a statement, Dyson said Sir James Dyson responded to a personal call from Boris Johnson to \"develop and make a medical-grade ventilator in 30 days during the national emergency\".",
      "\"Far from receiving any commercial benefit, there was significant commercial cost to Dyson which diverted 450 engineers away from commercial projects,\" added a company spokesperson.",
      "\"Uniquely amongst the many businesses involved, [Sir] James Dyson did not seek payment for any of the \u00a320m the company spent on the project \u2013 rather this was its contribution to the national effort to save lives.\""

      "This was because HMRC's system could not cope with the volume of calls, but customers were not warned they were about to be cut off, nor were they called back, the report added.",
      "The committee claimed HMRC was running a \"deliberately poor\" phone service in an attempt to push taxpayers to seek help online instead.",
      "However, that claim was described as \"completely baseless\" by HMRC bosses who said they had made huge improvements to service standards.",

    "summary": "New guidance on sentencing offenders from ethnic monitories and other backgrounds is set to start in April.",
    "story": [
      "The body advising judges on criminal sentences has hit back at the justice secretary's call for it to scrap new guidance on sentencing offenders from ethnic monitories.",
      "The Sentencing Council said ministers from both major parties or their representatives had known about the plans since 2022 and did not object.",
      "It comes after Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood last week wrote to the council urging it to rethink guidance directing judges to review the lives of offenders from ethnic minority and other backgrounds before deciding on a punishment.",
      "Opposition politicians had claimed the changes amounted to a \"two-tier justice\" system.",
      "Lord Justice William Davis, the chairman of the council, said that Mahmood's officials were fully briefed on the plans that had been three years in the making.",
      "He said that ministers could not \"dictate\" sentencing and he would have to take legal advice on Mahmood's powers over the council's work.",
      "This raises the bizarre possibility that the body advising judges on how to judge might decide to go to court for a ruling on whether the minister overseeing justice has any power to tell judges what to do.",
      "The row was triggered after the Sentencing Council, which advises judges and magistrates on the complexities of prison terms and community punishments, issued new guidance for England and Wales on when a court should order a pre-sentence report into an offender's life.",
      "These reports do not tie the hands of judges but they often provide the court with a detailed insight into why an individual fell into crime, their risk of reoffending and the chances for rehabilitation outside of jail.",
      "The new guidelines told judges to order a pre-sentence report if the offender is from a minority background, facing the possibility of jail for the first time, a woman or pregnant.",
      "It also urged them to always consider a report in a wider range of circumstances, including where an offender has an addiction, is transgender, or has learning difficulties.",
      "Minister threatens law change after 'two-tier' row",
      "Call for ministers to overrule 'two-tier' sentencing changes",
      "More funding for judges to tackle record court delays",
      "Writing to the Sentencing Council last week, Mahmood said she objected to the new guideline, saying: \"As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law.\"",
      "That came after the shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick described the plan as \"two-tier\" justice that would disadvantage white offenders.",
      "But in a six-page letter to Mahmood, the Sentencing Council chair said the new guidance aimed to correct disparities and had been drawn up after long discussions over how particular types of offenders were being treated differently to others.",
      "Lord Justice Davis said that people from ethnic minorities were receiving longer sentences and the aim was to ensure that punishments were more consistent, regardless of background.",
      "He said Conservative and Labour ministers, as well as their their officials, had at least 15 opportunities over three years to object to the plan",
      "\"I have seen it suggested that the guideline instructs sentencers to impose a more lenient sentence on those from ethnic minorities than white offenders,\" he said. \"Plainly that suggestion is completely wrong.\"",
      "The senior judge said ministerial representative had been at all 15 meetings where the changes was discussed between July 2022 and January 2025.",
      "The public consultation on the plans had set out the proposals and Conservative ministers, then in power, had welcomed the \"fuller guidance\".",
      "\"No concern was expressed about the term now under debate,\" said Lord Justice Davis.",
      "Only eight of 150 responses to the public consultation had objected to the explicit reference to ethnic minorities.",
      "The judge said: \"At no stage did the Lord Chancellor's representative express any concern or reservation about the term now under debate.",
      "\"The walk-through of the guideline with officials from the Ministry of Justice took place on Monday 3 March. Again no concern was expressed about the relevant term.\"",
      "While ministers have an exceptional power to intervene in the Sentencing Council's decisions, this has never been used in a situation where new guidance had been published and the government had already been extensively consulted and had not objected.",
      "\"I shall have to take legal advice as to whether the power... applies in those circumstances,\" said the judge.",
      "He continued: \"I do not accept the premise of your objection to the relevant part of the list of cohorts for whom a pre-sentence report will normally be considered necessary.",
      "\"In criminal proceedings where the offender is the subject of prosecution by the state, the state should not determine the sentence imposed on an individual offender.",
      "\"If sentencing guidelines of whatever kind were to be dictated in any way by Ministers of the Crown, this principle would be breached.\""

      "The Great Yarmouth MP was suspended by Reform and referred to the police over accusations he made threats of violence against the party's chairman. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed they are assessing an allegation of \"verbal threats\".",
      "There have also been allegations of bullying in Lowe's offices, which are being investigated by the lawyer hired by the party.",

      "On Sunday, the lawyer, a KC who has not been named by the party but whose credentials have been verified by the BBC, said: \"I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe MP and his constituency manager.",

      "\"Ever since this malicious attack on my reputation was launched, all I have asked for from both Reform and the KC is credible evidence against me. None has been provided. It still hasn't,\" he said.",
      "\"The KC has said she has been 'chasing' for that. I have received nothing. Because there is no credible evidence against me.\"",
      "He added: \"I have spoken with the KC at length, on the phone and through message. I've got to know her over the last week, and she has been very helpful, and is a charming lady who is trying to do her job in the very difficult position that Reform has put her in.\"",
      "'You have to stand up to bullies'",
      "He accused the party of an \"outright lie\" in claiming he had not co-operated with the investigation, a claim Reform made in a statement on Friday evening.",
      "\"I have been in discussions with my legal team this afternoon, and this will be followed by legal action in due course,\" Lowe told the BBC.",
      "\"I will not have my name dragged through the mud as part of a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage. You have to stand up to bullies, and I am doing exactly that.\"",
      "He said the lawyer had told him on Friday night: \"I advised that you should simply say that the party was precipitous to state that these allegations had been made without also saying that the party has commissioned an independent investigation and the investigation has not yet got underway to look at all the evidence and evaluate its veracity.\"",
      "Lowe's suspension came after the Daily Mail published an interview with Lowe where he said Reform under Nigel Farage's leadership remained a \"protest party led by the Messiah\".",

    "story": [
      "Despite the government's hopes, the UK has not, in the end, been exempted from President Trump's 25% steel and aluminium tariffs.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the UK will \"keep all options on the table\", but has not announced immediate retaliation.",
      "BBC Verify looks at how big the impact on the UK could be and what might happen next.",
      "Starmer says 'all options on table' on US tariffs",
      "Metal products",
      "The value of the UK's raw steel and aluminium exports to the US in 2024 was around \u00a3470m.",
      "But it's important to note that these latest US tariffs - taxes on imports - also cover products made with steel and aluminium, which covers everything from gym equipment, to furniture, to machinery.",
      "It's estimated by the Global Trade Alert think tank that the UK's exports of these products to the US in 2024 was around \u00a32.2bn.",
      "So the total annual value of UK exports affected would be around \u00a32.7bn.",
      "For context, the UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US on an annual basis in 2024 - so the share of goods hit by these new Trump tariffs represents just under 5%.",
      "The UK hopes to conclude a free trade deal with the Trump administration, which could mean these tariffs being removed.",
      "But we have no way of knowing if - or how soon - such an agreement could be concluded.",
      "Trump has also threatened to impose reciprocal tariffs on all the United States' trading partners, including the UK, from next month.",
      "These are taxes on imports to the US which are set at a similar rate to taxes other countries put on goods they import from the US.",
      "And the White House has said that, in deciding what level to set them, it will take into account countries' Value Added Tax rates.",
      "The US government regards VAT as a tax that discriminates against US imports - even though it applies equally to imports and domestically-produced goods.",
      "The UK has a 20% standard VAT rate, which could potentially mean the UK being hit by a substantial reciprocal tariff from the US.",
      "While the UK is not yet retaliating, the European Union has already confirmed it plans to impose tariffs on 26bn euros (\u00a322bn) a year worth of goods imported from America.",
      "And the EU is targeting US goods including Bourbon whiskey, jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, which are considered to be politically sensitive in America because of their iconic status and because of which US states some of them are  produced in.",
      "Notwithstanding the hope for a free trade deal, in the wake of any reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US, which are perceived to be unfair and punitive, the UK government could find itself under growing pressure to retaliate in a similar way to the EU.",
      "Why is Trump imposing tariffs?",
      "The US President has a long - and often shifting - list of justifications for imposing these import taxes.",
      "One is that he claims to want to restore fairness to America's trading relations with the rest of the world.",
      "Trump complains that some other countries have higher tariffs on the goods they import from the US, than the other way round.",
      "The US had an average external tariff of 3.3% in 2023.",
      "That was slightly lower than the UK's average tariff of 3.8%.",
      "It was also below the European Union's average tariff of 5% and China's average tariff of 7.5%.",
      "However, America's average tariff was considerably lower than those of some of its other trading partners such as India (17%) and South Korea (13.4%).",
      "Broadly speaking, it is legitimate for Trump to point out that some countries have a higher average tariff on imports than America does.",
      "Replacing income tax?",
      "Another justification for tariffs from the president is raising more tax revenue for the US government. At one stage during the presidential election campaign in 2024, he suggested that tariff revenue could entirely replace the federal income tax.",
      "This is not only implausible given the $3 trillion a year value of US imports and the $2 trillion a year raised by income tax - but it needs to be seen in the context of the fact that tariffs would push up US consumer prices.",
      "Trump also wants to put pressure on other countries to change some of their policies. This has been the explicit rationale for US tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with the White House saying it wants to pressure those countries to stamp out cross-border Fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Another key goal articulated by the president is wanting to encourage multinational manufacturing companies to invest and produce more in America to create domestic jobs.",
      "Some of these justifications are inconsistent.",
      "Tariffs cannot be a both a major permanent tax revenue raiser as well as a way to bring manufacturing back to America on a large scale as the latter implies imports - and therefore tariff revenues - slumping.",
      "Moreover, the vast majority of economists are also extremely sceptical about the likelihood of tariffs achieving many of these goals.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvend06zmlo",
    "published": "Sat, 08 Mar 2025 14:26:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM seizes the spotlight as Trump upends the world order - but he faces serious challenges in the UK.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump may be the best thing to happen to Starmer,\" says a diplomat, suggesting the brash property tycoon busy upending the world order might be just what the strait-laced prime minister - who's been dragging in the polls - needs.",
      "One of Labour's business backers calls it \"the PM's finest hour\" - a Remainer leader putting Britain at the heart of international action as Trump rattles the Western world's cage.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has certainly been incredibly visible \u2013 in the White House, leading a European summit at Lancaster House last weekend, hugging Zelensky, plotting a peacekeeping path with Macron.",
      "It's hard for the Conservatives and other opponents to compete with the prime minister's international moves dominating the news.",
      "Moments of crisis like the one we're living through are often when the public tunes into politics and looks to their leaders. With a shaky global situation, does No 10 look more solid than before?",
      "Some of his colleagues are certain. One government source tells me all the international activity is \"almost Blair-esque\", or even a moment like Thatcher and the Falklands which enabled the 80s Conservative prime minister to burnish her reputation and win successive election victories.",
      "Another minister suggests other leaders \"get their knickers in a twist\" publicly reacting to Trump's unpredictable comments and actions - \"but Keir has spent his whole career dealing with extreme circumstances. What he is able to do is get people to focus on the things that really matter.\"",
      "But impressive-looking diplomacy doesn't mean the UK is getting what it wants \u2013 missiles are still falling, overnight again in Donetsk and Kharkhiv. Donald Trump's commitment to guaranteeing Ukraine's security, even NATO's future, is shaky too.",
      "So let's take a calm look. Polling suggests there has been a nudge upwards for Sir Keir's personal ratings and for Labour, after a dreadful start in office and a steep, fast drop in the polls.",
      "His government would not be the first to be swept away by the intensity and glamour of global diplomacy which, however difficult or worthy, doesn't necessarily translate into significant brownie points at home.",
      "Perhaps in these wild times, we're seeing the prime minister carve out a role as \"reassurer in chief\". In political circles it's long been common to find criticisms of Sir Keir Starmer for, frankly, being a bit dull, and not willing to play the minute-by-minute political game. But with Trump in the White House stoking drama the PM's colleagues believe his steadiness has become an asset.",
      "And he's shown willingness to take action \u2013 increasing defence spending, albeit after months of pressure, getting European leaders together and drawing up military plans for after a peace deal. A senior government source says: \"The global crisis means people looking at us again, and the government has been making an argument that people are responding to: that we have got their backs.\"",
      "But aligning yourself with an American president doesn't always work out. Tony Blair's chinos weren't the only thing that became uncomfortable about his relationship with George W Bush.",
      "So while there's evidence the public are looking at Sir Keir a touch more favourably since his White House trip, as one union leader warns, \"for it to count he has to show the same mojo at home\".",
      "Take the row over sentencing this week. Or forthcoming arguments over cutting welfare, which ministers have been falling over themselves to soften the ground for.",
      "But overshadowing everything, priority number one: the grisly state of the economy and getting it to grow.",
      "In around a fortnight Rachel Reeves will be on her feet in Parliament, probably announcing cuts to public spending running to billions. Government sources point to some better statistics on wages, and cuts to interest rates, but Reeves is under enormous pressure to explain how the economy is going to escape the doldrums it has been stuck in for ages.",
      "All the Kodak moments, and grip and grins with international leaders in the world won't change that. The PM \"can walk and talk at the same\" time, one ally says. But there are, they acknowledge, \"only so many hours in the day\".",
      "Helping Ukraine against Putin's Russia has a clear moral story the prime minister finds easy to tell, and compelling to try to shape. In contrast, \"how do you bring prosperity to the regions? That's a real puzzle.\"",
      "In the next few days, starting with the PM's right-hand man Pat McFadden in the studio tomorrow, you will see the government try to kick up the pace of what is happening at home. First up - perhaps not a box-office hit - they'll be looking at making the Whitehall machine work better, including making it easier to get rid of civil servants.",
      "Ministers tell me Downing Street is being run more effectively than before Christmas and has a clearer sense of direction, after early embarrassment over being far less prepared than promised.",
      "Sir Keir chairs regular meetings with individual cabinet ministers in charge of the government's \"missions\". I'm told he \"cross-examines\" them and their officials - and if their answers aren't up to snuff, they get called in for another meeting. \"He is a very nice man, but he is a hard man too,\" one of them confides.",
      "As well as slimming down parts of the civil service, there'll be more on the government's plans to cut billions off the welfare bill. Labour will argue it's for good reason, to help people stuck on benefits - while critics will say it's a way for the government to save money off the backs of some of the most vulnerable people in the country.",
      "On Thursday, the prime minister is expected to make his own speech in an attempt to weave it all together into a grand narrative about safety abroad and at home. One government source said the last few weeks had galvanised Sir Keir's thinking on this: when things are uncertain on the international stage, \"everything feels a bit wobbly\" and domestic security is amplified: you look around and feel your job isn't secure, your street isn't safe.",
      "This thinking has been a long time coming. \"Security\" was a word and concept used by Reeves and Sir Keir in opposition - but recently he's been making a more ideological argument than those close to him are used to hearing.",
      "As well as making the case that what happens around the world is inextricably linked to what happens at home, he holds that the old international consensus among Western leaders has failed for millions of voters.",
      "That argument was crystallised into a long memo he sent to his cabinet ministers and political team in the middle of February. In it he wrote: \"The government's challenge was to shape this new era. Not to defend institutions that are broken or old ideas that have failed, but to be the voice of working people who more than anything want security in their lives, and a country that is on the up again.\"",
      "He wrote that politicians were wrong to think markets had solutions for almost everything. \"We were cowed by the market - we came to act as if it always knew best and the state should sit it out.\"",
      "He also said governments had failed on immigration, failed to understand the public's concerns and also - to tell the truth. \"We ended up treating all immigration as an untrammelled good. Somehow, politics ended up being too scared to say what is obvious - that some people are genuine refugees and some aren't; that people coming here to work can be a positive, but that an island nation needs to control its borders.\"",
      "Some extracts from the letter have been revealed before. But what is notable, reading the whole document, is the prime minister closes his letter to colleagues with a call to provide \"security\" for the country, alongside renewing public services. He writes: \"Now is our moment to be bigger and bolder - to put pedal on metal on wholescale reform and change our politics and our country. Security and renewal are our twin tasks - we must now deliver them.\"",
      "You'll hear more of that argument from ministers in the coming days - we had a glimpse of it in the studio last Sunday morning too.",
      "The profound uncertainty Donald Trump's arrival in the White House has given the prime minister a moment to step into the spotlight on the world stage.",
      "And his government is now much more overtly weaving an argument that working to establish security round the world is fundamentally connected to sorting out security at home.",
      "There is a reason why, fresh from all the diplomatic handshakes, Sir Keir was back in the more familiar hi-vis and hard hat announcing defence jobs in Belfast.",
      "No 10 wants you to see and believe that crisis abroad can mean opportunity at home. This spasm in global security has given a prime minister sometimes accused of being a blank page a clearer story to tell.",
      "But in the end, for any prime minister, it is what happens on home turf, not foreign adventures that matter the most. A sceptical public will take a lot of convincing to believe government can improve their situation \u2013 make it easier to manage the bills, buy a house, or for their kids to find a decent job.",
      "As as a senior figure in the Labour movement concludes, \"he likes the statesman role but the bottom line is, change in people's lives will be the decider.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:02:18 GMT",
    "summary": "President Macron has aired the idea that France's deterrence force could be used to defend of other European countries.",
    "story": [
      "So in the end Charles de Gaulle was right.",
      "As president of France in the 1960s, it was he who launched the policy of French strategic independence.",
      "Of course, he said, Americans were more our friends than Russians are. But the US too had interests. And one day their interests would clash with ours.",
      "In the world of today, his warnings have never seemed more clairvoyant.",
      "From his principle of superpower detachment, de Gaulle conjured the notion of France's sovereign nuclear deterrent \u2013 whose existence is now at the centre of debates over European security.",
      "France and the UK are the only two countries on the European continent which have nuclear weapons. Currently France has just short of 300 nuclear warheads, which can be fired from France-based aircraft or from submarines.",
      "The UK has about 250. The big difference is that the French arsenal is sovereign \u2013 i.e. developed entirely by France \u2013 whereas the UK relies on US technical input.",
      "On Wednesday President Emmanuel Macron aired the idea that France's deterrence force (force de frappe) could \u2013 in this highly uncertain new era - be associated with the defence of other European countries.",
      "His suggestion drew outrage from politicians of the hard right and left, who say that France is considering \"sharing\" its nuclear arsenal.",
      "That \u2013 according to government officials as well as defence experts \u2013 is a falsification of the argument. Nothing is to be \"shared\".",
      "According to Defence Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, the nuclear deterrent \"is French and will remain French \u2013 from its conception to its production to its operation, under a decision of the president.\"",
      "What is under discussion is not more fingers on the nuclear button. It is whether France's nuclear protection can be explicitly extended to include other European countries.",
      "Until now French nuclear doctrine has been built around the threat of a massive nuclear response if the president thought the \"vital interests\" of France were at stake.",
      "The limits of these \"vital interests\" have always been left deliberately vague \u2013 ambiguity and credibility being the two watchwords of nuclear deterrence.",
      "In fact French presidents going back to de Gaulle himself have all hinted that some European countries might de facto already be under the umbrella. In 1964 de Gaulle said that France would consider itself threatened if, for example, the USSR attacked Germany.",
      "So in one way there is nothing new in Macron suggesting a European dimension to France's deterrent.",
      "What is new, according to defence analysts, is that for the first time other European countries are also asking for it.",
      "\"In the past when France has made overtures [about extending nuclear protection], other countries were reluctant to respond,\" says Pierre Haroche of the Catholic University of Lille.",
      "\"They didn't want to send out the signal that they did not have complete faith in the US and Nato.\"",
      "\"But Trump has clarified the debate,\" Mr Laroche says. \"It's not that the Americans are talking of removing their nuclear deterrent \u2013 let's be clear, that does not seem to be on the table right now.\"",
      "\"But the credibility of US nuclear dissuasion is not what it was. That has opened the debate, and led the Germans to look more favourably on the idea of coming under a French and/or British umbrella.\"",
      "Last month the likely next German chancellor Friedrich Merz surprised the country's partners by saying it might be the moment for discussion with Paris and London on the subject.",
      "How a French or Franco-British European nuclear deterrent might operate is still far from clear.",
      "According to Mr Haroche, one option might be to position French nuclear-armed planes in other countries, such as Germany or Poland. The decision to press the trigger would still rest entirely with the French president, but their presence would send a strong signal.",
      "Alternatively, French bombers could patrol European borders, in the same way they regularly do French borders today. Or airfields could be developed in other countries to which French bombers could quickly deploy in an emergency.",
      "Numbers are an issue. Are 300 French warheads enough against Russia's thousands? Maybe not \u2013 but in an alliance with the UK 300 become 550. Also (to repeat the point) the American nuclear deterrent is still in theory in place. There are US nuclear bombs in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.",
      "Another question is whether to reformulate the French nuclear doctrine so as to state unambiguously that \"vital interests\" cover European allies too.",
      "Some say there is no need, because the strategic vagueness that exists already is part of the very deterrent.",
      "But Mr Haroche says there is a political dimension to stating more clearly that France will use its arsenal to defend other European countries.",
      "\"If the US is to be less present, then European countries will be depending much more on each other. Our strategic world becomes more horizontal,\" he says.",
      "\"In this new world it is important to build trust and confidence among ourselves. For France to signal it is prepared to take on risk in support of others \u2013 that helps create a solid front.\"",

      "However, away from the House of Commons the SNP MP was \"flailing through life\" and became ill through depression and anxiety, she has told the BBC.",
      "Black believes it was only through a \"life-changing\" diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that she was able to regain control of her life.",
      "The former Paisley and Renfrewshire South representative also said her party's performance at last year's general election, where the party dropped from 48 MPs to eight, was due to \"self-inflected\" woes.",
      "Black stood down as an elected politician in 2024 after nine years, having first won her seat aged just 20.",
      "She said her decision came after years in a \"toxic\" and \"bullying\" environment that was \"consuming my entire life\", with her mental health suffering badly until she was diagnosed with ADHD around 2018.",
      "\"Everything was fried - my body, my mind was emotionally fried,\" she told the BBC's Scotcast podcast.",
      "The interview comes ahead of the release of a new BBC documentary, Mhairi Black: Being Me Again.",
      "She said: \"I couldn't go out without throwing up. I would have panic attacks everywhere I went.",
      "\"I didn't understand what was going on and why I was feeling like this, I'm just beating myself up more, because I'm thinking, well, everybody else is managing to get into work okay. Why are you the one that can't cope with it?\"",
      "The documentary - which will air on BBC Scotland at 21:00 on Sunday and is available on iPlayer from Friday -  shows her discussing the condition and her last year at Westminster.",
      "She describes how anxiety became depression, and saw her take time off from Westminster duties - a decision that brought criticism for her attendance record at parliament and holding a lack of surgeries in her constituency.",
      "\"Westminster didn't have a capacity for signing off, so it looked to the rest of the world like I've no been turning up, when in actual fact I was in the foetal position in my house,\" she says.",
      "For Black, the diagnosis of ADHD has had a \"life-changing\" impact on her life.",
      "She told Scotcast: \"It was massive because it felt as though someone had just handed me the instruction manual for my own brain, and suddenly I was able to think like, I'm not mad, I'm just wired differently.",
      "\"It allowed me to stop beating myself up so much because there were times when I would struggle to do things that other folk do effortlessly.\"",
      "Black compares the condition to the BBC's Sherlock series, where Benedict Cumberbatch's famous detective would use his \"mind palace\" to work out cases.",
      "\"It feels like there's constantly three conversations in my head \u2013 and a song,\" she laughs.",
      "However, Black told Scotcast she decided not to go public with her diagnosis at the time as it \"would get used against me\" in Westminster - an aggressive culture that her wife Katie was surprised by.",
      "She recalls: \"When she [Mhairi] started telling me about her experiences since being in parliament, I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.",
      "\"It was very different to what I'd believed. I was surprised how isolated she was.\"",
      "Black recounts seeing punch-ups and bullying during her time as an MP, and although she raised concerns with her party, the support offered was not enough.",
      "She said: \"I think leadership at all levels have been aware of people who've been unhappy with how they've been treated, and I imagine most people would agree that we could be better at how we handle it.\"",
      "Elected as the SNP dominated the Scottish vote, her departure from Westminster came on a night when, in her own words, \"the SNP got an absolute doing\".",
      "Black felt the SNP's poor result happened due to \"in-fighting that was spilling out into the public domain\".",
      "She added that this was not helped by power being centred around leader Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell who was the party's chief executive.",
      "She said: \"The reason that I think it spilled out into the public was because a lot of people had hit their limit because they felt like their voices weren't being listened to within the party.",
      "\"There were a lot of folk who weren't comfortable with the idea of the chief executive and the leader of the party basically being a couple in one house.\"",
      "Black added she believed the SNP worked best when on the left politically, and that if the views of current deputy Kate Forbes became party policy there would be a \"mass exodus\" of members.",
      "Forbes is known for her conservative views on issues such as gay marriage, abortion and trans rights.",
      "Black was a headline act from her first days in Parliament, when her initial Commons speech saw her decry poverty and was viewed 10 million times within days.",
      "It came after a whirlwind time when she overturned Douglas Alexander's majority in 2015, as part of an SNP surge that saw the party take nearly every constituency in Scotland.",
      "Black had been energised by the independence referendum in 2014, which she calls a \"magical\" time.",
      "Defeat in the independence vote \"felt like a death\" she says, but within months she was standing for election - a time that saw social media posts she made as a teenager resurface, including declarations of love for Smirnoff Ice and views on football.",
      "\"The way it was twisted to make her out be a drunken, bigoted wee lout was one of the worst times of my life,\" recalls her father.",
      "It did not hurt her at the polls though,  and she carried that bluntness into her Westminster career.",
      "'I get death threats all the time'",
      "However, a vulnerability was underneath the surface - at one point the documentary shows a stuffed panda bear given to her by her mum to keep her company in London.",
      "In 2018 she spoke at length about the abuse she had suffered online, repeating some of the many foul-mouthed  slurs sent to her about her appearance and sexuality, including that you \"can't put lipstick on a pig\" and that she was \"too ugly to be raped\".",
      "\"It's difficult to describe how you can feel so alone and unsafe and under attack with nothing more than your phone sitting there,\" she reflects.",
      "\"I get death threats all the time but there was one in particular where the police came to my flat down in London and the house up in Scotland.",

    "story": [
      "Farmers may turn their backs on environmental work for more intensive food production after the government suddenly closed a green funding scheme, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) has warned.",
      "The Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI), which pays farmers in England to manage land to protect soil, restore hedgerows and boost nature recovery, was a key part of the post-Brexit payment scheme that replaced EU subsidies.",
      "The government said SFI had been a success, with 37,000 funding agreements agreed, but it would not accept any new applications. No replacement has been announced.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, NFU president, said that it was \"another shattering blow to English farms\".",
      "Mr Bradshaw said the sudden closure would force farmers to decide \"whether to turn their backs on environmental work and just farm as hard as they can to survive\".",
      "Organic arable farmer Anna Biesty, who has a 300-hectare farm on the north Norfolk coast, said she was planning to apply for SFI funding and its closure means she now faces a \u00a3140,000 shortfall in her future income.",
      "She told BBC News she is now \"angry, frustrated and apprehensive about the future\".",
      "\"You spend time making plans based on the best information you have but then that plan I made is now pointless. It's a waste of time and that must be multiplied all around the country, whether it's farmers or nature charities who are managing land and using similar schemes.",

      "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced the closure of SFI, which was launched in 2022, with little warning.",
      "It said that in total, more than 50,000 farm businesses - covering half of all farmed land - were now benefiting from wider environmental land management schemes (Elms).",
      "The 37,000 agreements signed for SFI funding had meant all the scheme's budget had been allocated and no more new applications could be accepted.",
      "In total, under the SFI scheme, \u00a31.05bn has been paid out or is contractually committed to farmers in current agreements or applications for funding since 2024.",
      "SFI is the largest part of Elms, which is the system of farm payments set up to replace EU subsidies with the idea that \"public goods\", like restoring and creating wildlife habitats, would be delivered by farmers in return for public money.",
      "The government said it was still committed to paying \u00a35bn over two years for such sustainable farming and nature recovery work.",
      "'Biggest budget'",
      "It added that a \"new and improved\" SFI, which will have a capped budget, will be set up but its details will not be announced until later in the year.",
      "Daniel Zeichner, minister for food security and rural affairs, said: \"This government is proud to have set the biggest budget for sustainable food produce in history.",
      "\"More farmers are now in schemes and more money is being spent through them than ever before. That is true today and will remain true tomorrow.\"",
      "But Mr Bradshaw said the closure of the current SFI scheme had \"slammed shut\" the door for funding for thousands of farmers.",
      "He said the closure was \"delivered yet again with no warning, no understanding of the industry and a complete lack of compassion or care\".",
      "Victoria Vyvyan, the president of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents thousands of rural landowners, said that closing the scheme was the \"most cruel\" betrayal.",
      "She added that the decision \"actively harms nature. It actively harms the environment. And, with war once again raging in Europe, to actively harm our food production is reckless beyond belief\".",
      "Martin Lines, chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), said the gap before a new SFI scheme is in place would leave some farmers \"in a really difficult financial position\".",

      "People sometimes refer to a lunar eclipse as a \"blood moon\" because of the way the Moon can turn a deep, coppery red during the eclipse.",
      "This is caused by a process known as \"Rayleigh scattering\" which also makes the sky blue and our sunsets red. It scatters more of the shorter blue wavelength light, allowing the longer red wavelength light to remain visible.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, all of the light shining onto the Moon has come through Earth's atmosphere. It's as if every sunrise and sunset in the world is projected onto the lunar surface.",

      "Another top tip from Imo: it'll be dark so bring a light to help get around, but use a red torch if you can get hold of one. It helps keep your eyes adjusted to the dark.",
      "Also, of course, check the weather forecast.",
      "\"Even though some people might say it's not that unusual to get a lunar eclipse, as we can see one every few years, next time it comes around, it might be cloudy. So, if you can, definitely do get out and try and have a look,\" said Imo.",

      "Prof Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds said: \"The priority, I imagine, for the crews trying to contain the damage, will be to extinguish the fires and keep vessels afloat. This will reduce the quantity of chemicals entering the water and the risk for wildlife downstream.\"",
      "The fire that broke out following the crash will have helped to burn off some of the jet fuel but testing kits are being set to the site to confirm there is no residue remaining.",
      "Frode Vikeb\u00f8, research manager at the Institute of Marine Research said that the UK government will be modelling the spread of any contaminants at sea, considering ocean circulation and weather conditions, as part of \"standard procedure\".",
      "In terms of mitigation, Dr Karen Purnell, former director of ITOPF - which advises governments on maritime pollution, said the first approach would be to let the jet fuel \"dissipate naturally where possible and avoiding deliberate containment.\"",
      "If any jet fuel did make it to shore, she said: \"Flushing the shoreline to remobilise the fuel and perhaps directing it into absorbent booms or mats for later disposal could be an option.\" But she said the approach would differ depending on the different types of environment, for example whether there were wetlands.",

      "Athena touched down on the lunar South Pole shortly after 1730GMT (1230EST) on Thursday, but it later was revealed the craft had landed on its side.",
      "It was supposed to spend 10 days searching for water ice, but the position of its solar panels and the cold temperatures of the rocky region mean it cannot recharge.",
      "Intuitive Machines partnered with US space agency Nasa to explore whether humans can live on the Moon.",
      "\"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge,\" the company said in a statement about the mission called IM-2.",
      "Last year Intuitive Machines' first spacecraft also landed on its side, breaking a leg.",
      "It is unlikely that the instruments on board can now be used, including a drill to penetrate the lunar soil, a hopping robot to explore a shadowed crater, and the first lunar antenna.",
      "\"Clearly the mission can only have achieved a fraction of its science goals,\" says Dr Simeon Barber, lunar scientist at the Open University.",
      "But the ambitious mission still achieved milestones in ongoing exploration of the Moon.",
      "Athena made it further south than any other lander, reaching the Mons Mouton region which is a flat-topped mountain about 100 miles (160km) from the South Pole.",
      "It is considered a difficult and risky area to land in.",
      "The sun is low in the sky and casts shadow that can confuse landers trying to touch down. And the amount of sunlight reaching the craft can limit how much electricity it produces in its solar panels.",

      "A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations.",
      "However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken.",
      "The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly \"abundance\" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes.",
      "This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts.",
      "Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species.",
      "The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%.",
      "\"While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,\" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University.",
      "Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US.",
      "The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled.",
      "\"That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,\" Prof Grames said.",
      "Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers.",
      "Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems.",
      "They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species.",

      "Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery.",

    "story": [
      "Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.",
      "This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat.",
      "Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat.",
      "The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk.",
      "\"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.",
      "She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".",
      "\"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\"",
      "This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.",
      "They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.",
      "Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\".",
      "The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.",

      "\"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

    "title": "UK homes install subsidised heat pumps at record level",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e4nlxlq08o",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 09:40:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthew, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review it recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthew agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "The hearing is due to be held in private because it relates to the security services, but campaigners say the public has a right to hear it.",
      "\"This hearing should not be held in secret,\" Caroline Wilson Palow, legal director at Privacy International told the BBC.",
      "\"The public has a right to know whether or not the security of a service that could be used by millions or perhaps billions of people worldwide is being undermined.\"",
      "What Apple pulling Advanced Data Protection means for you",
      "The row began in February when it first emerged the government was seeking the right to be able to access data protected by ADP, using powers granted to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "The Act allows it to covertly compel firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "ADP allows users with iCloud accounts and storage to secure photos, notes, voice memos and other data with end to end encryption, meaning no-one but the user - not even Apple - can access it.",
      "Getting round that would involve the creation of a so-called \"backdoor\" - a capability some fear bad actors would ultimately be able to exploit.",
      "At the time Apple reiterated its long-standing commitment not to weaken the privacy or security of its systems.",
      "\"As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products, and we never will,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "Later in February the row escalated, as Apple announced it was pulling ADP in the UK.",
      "Shortly after that, the BBC learnt Apple was taking legal action by appealing to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to try to overturn the government's demand.",
      "On its website, the Tribunal lists a hearing to be held before its president Lord Justice Singh on Friday afternoon.",
      "The listing makes no mention of Apple or the government, nor has the Tribunal confirmed if they are the parties involved - however a source familiar with the matter has indicated that is the case, as was first reported by Computer Weekly.",
      "In the statement it issued in February, Apple said it regretted the action it felt it had been forced to take.",
      "\"Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end-encryption is more urgent than ever before,\" it said.",
      "\"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in future in the UK.\"",
      "In a previous statement, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"The UK has a longstanding position of protecting our citizens from the very worst crimes, such as child sex abuse and terrorism, at the same time as protecting people's privacy.",
      "\"The UK has robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy and privacy is only impacted on an exceptional basis, in relation to the most serious crimes and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so.\""

    "summary": "Market researchers say the slumping popularity of the market-leading Apple Watch was to blame",
    "story": [
      "Global sales of smartwatches have fallen for the first time, new figures indicate, in large part due to a sharp decline in the popularity of market leader, Apple.",
      "Market research firm Counterpoint says 7% fewer of the devices were shipped in 2024 compared to the year before.",
      "Shipments of Apple Watches fell by 19% in that period, Counterpoint says.",
      "It blames the slump on a lack of new features in Apple's latest devices, and the fact a rumoured high-end Ultra 3 model never materialised.",
      "\"The biggest driver of the decline was North America, where the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" said Counterpoint senior research analyst Anshika Jain.",
      "Apple was also hit with sales and import bans in the US in late 2023 and early 2024 over a disputed patent regarding blood oxygen level monitoring - which Ms Jain says also contributed to lower sales figures in the first half of 2024.",
      "It retained 22% of market share in the final three months of 2024, down from 25% a year earlier.",
      "\"We've been through a period where the smartwatch has gone from being a new and exciting gadget, to something now that's stabilising - the feature set isn't changing very dramatically year over year,\" said Leo Gebbie, principal analyst at CCS Insight.",
      "Despite the overall decline, last year did see a massive rise in sales for Chinese-made smartwatches from brands such as Xiaomi, Huawei and Imoo.",
      "Sales in China also grew from 19% of the market to 25% in the year from the last quarter of 2023.",
      "This was the first time it recorded more smartwatch sales than India or North America, according to Counterpoint.",
      "The Chinese manufacturers also appeared to tap into another trend - the growing popularity of smartwatches for children, the only segment of the market to grow in 2024.",
      "Imoo, known in China as \"Little Genius\", specialises in children's smart watches and saw a 22% rise in shipments.",
      "\"The kids' smart watch segment is gaining traction as parents are concerned for their children's safety, and they desire to track and stay constantly connected with their children,\" Counterpoint's Balbir Singh said.",
      "But Imoo was eclipsed by a 135% rise in shipments from Beijing-based tech company Xiaomi.",
      "Its Smart Band activity trackers sell for a fraction of the price of rivals made by Apple and Samsung.",
      "\"We're seeing the large consumer electronics players like Apple and Samsung really just look to drive a way higher margin and not engage in the price war,\" said Mr Gebbie.",
      "\"Xiaomi has done a really good job of selling devices, particularly in regions like southern and eastern Europe where that greater affordability tends to resonate a lot more strongly with customers.\"",
      "Another large contributor to the global sales drop was India, which fell from 30% of the market to 23%.",
      "He said this was partly because of a \"bubble\" in ultra-cheap devices from Indian manufacturers which has now burst.",
      "\"We read and saw a lot in terms of complaints about the quality of devices, with people being unhappy with them,\" he said.",
      "\"For those companies, there's been a sense that from this point onwards they would be better served by maybe making and selling products with a slightly longer lifespan.\"",
      "Counterpoint says it expects a small recovery in the global market, with \"single-digit percentage growth in 2025\".",
      "It predicts the uptick in sales will be driven by the increasing adoption of AI features, and a greater emphasis of providing a wider range of health data.",

      "That's more than any other country in the world - and Beijing is keen to leverage it. \"Building strength in education, science and talent is a shared responsibility,\" Xi told party leaders last week.",
      "Ever since China opened its economy to the world in the late 1970s, it has \"been through a process of accumulating talent and technology,\" says Abbott Lyu, vice-president of Shanghai-based Whalesbot, a firm that makes AI toys. \"In this era of AI, we've got many, many engineers, and they are hardworking.\"",
      "Behind him, a dinosaur made of variously coloured bricks roars to life. It's being controlled through code assembled on a smartphone by a seven-year-old.",
      "The company is developing toys to help children as young as three learn code. Every package of bricks comes with a booklet of code. Children can then choose what they want to build and learn how to do it. The cheapest toy sells for around $40.",
      "\"Other countries have AI education robots as well, but when it comes to competitiveness and smart hardware, China is doing better,\" Mr Lyu insists.",
      "The success of DeepSeek turned its CEO Liang Wenfeng into a national hero and \"is worth 10 billion yuan of advertising for [China's] AI industry,\" he added.",
      "\"It has let the public know that AI is not just a concept, that it can indeed change people's lives. It has inspired public curiosity.\"",

      "AI is hungry for data - the more it gets, the smarter it makes itself and, with around a billion mobile phone users compared to just over 400 million in the US, Beijing has a real advantage.",
      "The West, its allies and many experts in these countries believe that data gathered by Chinese apps such as DeepSeek, RedNote or TikTok can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party. Some point to the country's National Intelligence Law as evidence of this.",
      "But Chinese firms, including ByteDance, which owns TikTok, says the law allows for the protection of private companies and personal data. Still, suspicion that US user data on TikTok could end up in the hands of the Chinese government drove Washington's decision to ban the hugely popular app.",
      "That same fear \u2013 where privacy concerns meet national security challenges - is hitting Deepseek. South Korea banned new downloads of DeepSeek, while Taiwan and Australia have barred the app from government-issued devices.",
      "Chinese companies are aware of these sensitivities and Mr Tang was quick to tell the BBC that \"privacy was a red line\" for his company. Beijing also realises that this will be a challenge in its bid to be a global leader in AI.",
      "\"DeepSeek's rapid rise has triggered hostile reactions from some in the West,\" a commentary in the state-run Beijing Daily noted, adding that \"the development environment for China's AI models remains highly uncertain\".",
      "But China's AI firms are not deterred. Rather, they believe thrifty innovation will win them an undeniable advantage \u2013 because it was DeepSeek's claim that it could rival ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost that shocked the AI industry.",
      "So the engineering challenge is how to make more, for less. \"This was our Mission Impossible,\" Mr Tang said. His company found that the robotic arm used to move chess pieces was hugely expensive to produce and would drive the price up to around $40,000.",
      "So, they tried using AI to help do the work of engineers and enhance the manufacturing process. Mr Tang claims that has driven the cost down to $1,000.",
      "\"This is innovation,\" he says. \"Artificial engineering is now integrated into the manufacturing process.\"",
      "This could have enormous implications as China applies AI on a vast scale. State media already show factories full of humanoid robots. In January, the government said that it would promote the development of AI-powered humanoid robots to help look after its rapidly ageing population.",
      "Xi has repeatedly declared \"technological self-reliance\" a key goal, which means China wants to create its own advanced chips, to make up for US export restrictions that could hinder its plans.",
      "The Chinese leader knows he is in for a long race \u2013 the Beijing Daily recently warned that the DeepSeek moment was not a time for \"AI triumphalism\" because China was still in \"catch-up mode\".",

      "The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years.",
      "Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised.",
      "The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered.",
      "In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems.",
      "An NHS spokesperson said: \"We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate.\"",
      "Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data.",

      "The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered.",
      "\"When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'.\"",
      "The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other.",
      "The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information.",
      "He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure.",
      "\"I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,\" he said.",
      "On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do.",
      "Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure.",

      "Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office)  and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), \"in the interests of transparency\", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach.",
      "The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January.",
      "In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: \"There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems.\"",
      "He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours.",
      "\"The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false.\"",
      "The security agency will complete its review later this week.",
      "Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: \"We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.\"",
      "Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern.",
      "\"There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey.",
      "\"The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,\" he added.",
      "Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified.",
      "\"Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,\" says Scott Helme, a security researcher.",

    "story": [
      "There's one. And another. This robot was hunting for rocks. A three-pronged claw descended from above and plucked a stone off the seabed.",
      "All the while, the autonomous machine's on-board camera scanned for creatures that might be resting on those rocks, to avoid snatching an innocent lifeform from its habitat.",
      "The test, carried out in a harbour in November, demonstrated one approach to mining for polymetallic nodules, potato-sized lumps containing metals scattered on the seabed in vast quantities, in much deeper parts of the ocean.",
      "Such metals are sought-after for use in renewable energy devices and batteries, for example. But deep-sea mining is a controversial means of obtaining them because of its potentially significant environmental impacts.",
      "\"We felt that a vehicle that used AI to look for life and avoid it could have much less of an environmental footprint,\" explains Oliver Gunasekara, co-founder and chief executive of Impossible Metals.",
      "The firm's system is 95% accurate at detecting lifeforms of 1mm or greater in size, he says.",
      "The robot's arms are similar to those that pick and place items in automated warehouses \u2013 they are optimised for speed. Plus, each claw kicks up a relatively small puff of sediment as it plucks its target off the seafloor. Impossible Metals aims to further reduce this disturbance.",
      "Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that deep-sea mining is a good idea, however.",
      "\"Mining would by its nature remove the very substrate of life in and on the deep seafloor, no matter the technology,\" says Jessica Battle, who leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.",
      "Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or less untouched and still relatively poorly understood. \"If you're not sure what's down there, then leave it alone,\" says John Childs at Lancaster University. \"That's been the widespread position from science [to date].\"",
      "Scars left by mining experiments in the past, using older, highly disruptive technologies, have been severe.",
      "In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years later.",
      "Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.",
      "Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.",
      "Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt, gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green energy transition.",
      "Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact.",
      "No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that could change this year if the first set of international regulations governing these activities is published, possibly in July.",
      "Mr Gunasekara's firm is currently building a larger version of its robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing claws.",
      "He adds that \"hundreds\" of such bots would need to harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to processing sites on land.",
      "Unlike some other methods, in which heavy subsea equipment is tethered to support ships, Impossible Metals' vessel would not have to remain in a precise spot for a long period, meaning its engines would not create as much noise. This would lessen the impact on wildlife, claims Mr Gunasekara.",
      "He also argues that deep-sea mining would reduce the need for mining on land: \"Anyone that doesn't want to do deep-sea mining is implicitly saying we need to do more land-based mining.\"",
      "Jovana Jovanova at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands is working on a different robot arm system that could gather metals from the seafloor. She stresses that those working in this field should seek to develop technology \"in sync\" with the environment.",
      "Some deep-sea materials might be removed using more invasive methods, however. Seabed Solutions, a Norwegian firm, is working on a saw-based device to extract mineral-containing crusts or layers. The company says it is trying to reduce the volume of sediment disturbed by this process.",
      "\"You shield the cutting area and you ensure that it is under pressure,\" says managing director B\u00e5rd Brekke J\u00f8rgensen. \"You have a suction head interface [on] your cutting tool.\"",
      "The Metals Company, a firm launched by former Nautilus Minerals investor Gerard Barron, is working on a different technique.",
      "Mr Barron, chief executive, is bullish about the company's prospects, despite the protests and lawsuits his firm has faced.  Among the problems is a class action lawsuit filed by investors over the company's reporting of proceeds from a partner company in 2023 -  Mr Barron says \"there's absolutely nothing in it\".",
      "Those calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining are \"virtue signalling\" he says, adding that the new Trump administration in the US may help his company.",
      "\"We have many of our best supporters assuming very important roles in the new administration,\" says Mr Barron.",
      "The Metals Company intends to file an application for deep-sea mining in the Pacific Ocean with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) later this year. The ISA is yet to confirm how it would regulate such activities.",
      "Dutch company Allseas, which is working with Mr Barron's firm, has developed mining machinery for scooping polymetallic nodules off the seabed and sending them to a support ship on the surface.",
      "Trials of the system in 2022 retrieved more than 3,000 tonnes of nodules, The Metals Company says.",
      "The Metals Company's own tests suggest that the debris plumes created by this process would spread for hundreds of metres from the mining area, rather than many kilometres, and that deposited sediment gradually clears over time.",
      "Claims that sediment would be distributed many kilometres from the mining area were \"total nonsense\", says Mr Barron.",
      "Jeroen Hagelstein, a spokesman for Allseas, says his firm has adjusted the force of waterjets used to dislodge nodules in an attempt to minimise sediment disturbance.",
      "Some sediment brought to the surface with the nodules gets dumped back into the ocean.  Mr Hagelstein says his colleagues are considering whether to return it at a depth of three or four kilometres rather than discarding it at the surface, though he adds that this may require too much energy to adequately reduce the overall environmental impact.",
      "Mr Barron acknowledges that his firm's machinery might affect lifeforms living on or around the nodules. \"If you're a sponge sitting on a nodule and we come and collect you, there will be an impact,\" he says. Though he points out that many nodules would also be left behind.",
      "Ann Vanreusel at Ghent University has studied deep-sea wildlife. She says the sought-after polymetallic nodules are themselves home to some creatures, which use them as a substrate. So even if mining machinery created zero sediment disturbance, pollution and noise, removing nodules would still impact the ecosystem.",
      "Dr Childs also mentions the importance of the deep sea to many indigenous cultures. Mining could interfere with this, he suggests.",
      "And there's another issue. The market for metals metals sought by deep-sea mining firms is notoriously volatile, meaning the business case for deep-sea mining may not be as strong as some hope, says Lea Reitmeier at the London School of Economics.",

      "\"Don't share your home address anywhere, for example, accidently filming a video with a laptop in the background that has sensitive information on, and when you go online shopping don't add all details to every random website, for example, your date of birth,\" says Mr Kaziukonis.",
      "\"It could be leaked and used against you.\" He also advises using a different email address for websites that you sign up to. \"That limits the spamming.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5ng663d1wo",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:09:20 GMT",
    "summary": "As the president tries to force Mexico to stop the flow of drugs, cartel members tell Quentin Sommerville they will not be deterred.",
    "story": [
      "The fentanyl dealer from Los Angeles stands to the side watching carefully as a Mexican drugs cartel operative prepares his latest shipment. The synthetic opioid drug is wrapped in foil, sealed in plastic, then dropped with an oily splash into the petrol tank of the trafficker's nondescript car.",
      "Jay, not his real name, had crossed earlier from the US to this cartel-run safe house on the Mexican side of the border. The house looks like any other in this neighbourhood. We are told to drive in quickly and an iron gate closes firmly behind us. They don't cook the drug here, but still they are wary of attracting attention. The men all speak in hushed voices and work quickly.",
      "Their lethal business has become the centre of a dispute causing shockwaves in the global economy after the White House used fentanyl smuggling through US borders as a key justification for raising tariffs. US President Donald Trump has also vowed to \"wage war\" on the drug cartels.",
      "The BBC gained rare access to a cartel's operation along the border and travelled to the US to meet their ultimate customers, to see if the international row was doing anything to halt the illegal flow of narcotics.",
      "The men we meet at the safe house are foot-soldiers of a well-known cartel. Two of them loading the car admit to fleeting moments of remorse. But when I ask the man packing the drugs into the fuel tank if he feels guilty about the deaths the pills cause, he sniggers. \"We have family too, of course we feel guilty. But if I stop, it's going to continue. It's not my problem,\" he tells me with a shrug.",
      "The men keep their faces covered while they remove the back seat of the car to gain access to the tank, taking care not to spill petrol. The smell inside the car could alert customs officers on the other side of the border that the fuel tank has been tampered with.",
      "The light green pills, 5,000 in total and marked with an M, are packed tightly - a fraction of what Jay says he sells every week in LA and across the American northwest.",
      "\"I try to get 100,000 pills a week, every week,\" the softly spoken dealer tells me. \"I don't send them in one vehicle. I try to spread it in different cars. That way I minimise my risk of losing all my pills.\"",
      "A 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico was introduced in response to what President Donald Trump said was the unacceptable flow of illegal drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. Some of those tariffs have since been delayed until 2 April.",
      "Defeating the fentanyl trade is one of President Trump's top policy goals, but Jay doesn't rate his chances.",
      "\"Last time he was in office, he tried to do the same thing, and it never happened. There's always going to be a demand. And where's the biggest demand? United States, lucky for us. We're here in the border,\" says Jay with a smile.",
      "There is so much of the drug flowing into the US, most of it coming from Mexico, that according to Jay the price he sells it for in LA has fallen from about $5 or $6 per pill a year ago, to $1.50 now (\u00a31.16).",
      "Mexican police say cartels switched in a big way to fentanyl, which is 50 times more potent than heroin, because unlike other opiates - which are made from the opium poppy - it is completely synthetic and much easier to make and transport.",
      "Fentanyl's strength and addictiveness has left a deep scar on American society: drug overdoses kill more people in the US than guns or car crashes. Fatalities have started to decline, perhaps in part to the greater availability of Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of overdoses of opioids. But the latest figures are still stark: 87,000 overdose deaths (mostly from opioids) from October 2023 to September 2024, down from 114,000 the year before.",
      "In an attempt to stave off punitive tariffs from the White House, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has pledged to send 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. The government has made more than 900 arrests since October in Sinola, a major drug trafficking hub. Back in December, Mexico announced its biggest ever fentanyl seizure in the state: more than a tonne of pills. In fact, the country has seized more fentanyl in the past five months than it did in the previous year.",
      "Mexico has also made it harder to import a key ingredient of fentanyl from China, prompting cartels to reduce the strength of each pill - and, in the process, making them less deadly.",
      "And at the end of February, 29 senior drug cartel figures were handed over to the United States, including members of five of the six Mexican crime syndicates that President Trump's administration recently designated as terrorist organisations.",
      "President Sheinbaum also said she had agreed to the CIA increasing surveillance drone operations over Mexican territory in search of fentanyl drugs labs, after the media revealed the covert missions.",
      "Jay acknowledges the dangers of his trade to himself and his customers, but is untroubled.",
      "\"They always try to blame us, that we are the ones that are poisoning American citizens. But they're the biggest users.",
      "He coolly insulates himself from responsibility and guilt for the deaths his drugs cause. He claims not to know anyone who has died using his product. \"I only deal with other suppliers,\" he tells me.",
      "The cartels mostly use American citizens to courier their drugs across the border, as they are less likely to be stopped by US Customs and Border Protection. The driver, who goes by the name Charlie, has a US passport. He, too, is mostly indifferent to the suffering the fentanyl epidemic has caused.",
      "\"I need the money,\" he says. When I ask him how many times he has made the drugs run, he replies: \"Too many.\" (I later learn that the 5,000 pills in the fuel tank made it across the border without incident.)",
      "President Sheinbaum has also recently emphasised the demand side of the crisis, saying the US fentanyl crisis began with the legal but \"irresponsible approval\" of painkillers, such as OxyContin, starting in the late 1990s. \"The US government should take responsibility for the opioid-consumption crisis that has caused so many deaths,\" she said at a daily news conference.",
      "In Philadelphia's Kensington neighbourhood - dubbed the largest open-air drugs market on the US east coast - Rosalind Pichardo of Operation Save Our City is on to her second Bible. She records in the book's back pages the number of times she has reversed an opioid overdose using the quick-acting drug Naloxone.",
      "For the past six years, the figure totals 2,931. She flicks through the pages and that number written in red comes alive with the memories of the individuals she saved, and the ones she lost.",
      "She begins to list: \"Male in his 60s\u2026 male 30s\u2026 female in her 30s, very thin, no hair.\" Beside each name in this roll-call of fentanyl victims, is the number of doses of Naloxone - sold under the name Narcan - she used to attempt to revive people.",
      "Ms Pichardo, who runs a drop-in centre called Sunshine House, operates what she calls a \"no-judgement zone\". She bristles at the terms like \"addict\", \"junkie\" or \"zombie\", which have been used to describe the people of her neighbourhood. Instead, she calls everyone \"sunshine\".",
      "Some she doesn't remember; others she will never forget.",
      "\"Look at this one, seven years old, two Narcans,\" she points out. Ms Pichardo had been called to a neighbour's house where a woman was holding in her arms a child who had turned blue. Ms Pichardo went inside and the girl was placed on the floor, but as she entered the child's father ran upstairs carrying a bag. \"I'm thinking if that was my child, I'd be running to help the child,\" she recalls.",
      "At first, she thought it might be epilepsy, but she spotted drug scales and plastic baggies on a nearby table. The kid's dad was a drug dealer; the seven-year-old had been poisoned by his stash and overdosed. \"I was livid,\" she says.",
      "Those two doses of Narcan were enough to save the child's life.",
      "On another page, a woman, six months pregnant, two doses of Narcan. She also survived.",
      "In Kensington, drugs are cheap and plentiful, and people shoot up in the open. As she walks the neighbourhood, Ms Pichardo finds people passed out on the pavement, a woman in a stupor with her trousers down, a man lying prone next to a metro turnstile, another man in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and money in his hands.",
      "He, like a growing number of opioid users, has had a limb amputated. A new drug on the street, the animal tranquilliser Xylazine, is being mixed with fentanyl. It leads to open wounds which become infected. The air is rank in places.",
      "John White is 56 years old, and for 40 of those years he has struggled with addiction. At Sunshine House, Ms Pichardo serves him a bowl of homemade soup.",
      "\"I've been in this city all my life,\" he says. \"The fentanyl and opioid epidemic is the worst I've ever seen. Fentanyl will get you so hooked that you have to get more. So they put it in everything.\"",
      "Mr White had a fentanyl overdose after smoking a joint laced with the drug: it is being added to all kinds of illicit drugs, including heroin, cocaine and marijuana.",
      "Ms Pichardo holds out little hope that even if the fentanyl trade is cut off from Mexico that it will improve people's lives in Kensington.",
      "\"The problem that we have with the war on drugs is - it didn't work then [and] I don't believe it's going to work now,\" she explains.",
      "When the supply of one drug is cut off, another replaces it, she says. \"Once there was heroin, now there's no more. Now there's fentanyl. When there's no fentanyl, now it's going to be Xylazine. So it's like they'll find a way to keep people addicted so that people can make money off of people, off the suffering of people,\" says Ms Pichardo.",
      "Directly across from Sunshine House, a young woman is found collapsed on the pavement, her body splayed across the concrete: she's unresponsive. Ms Pichardo is quickly on the scene, her medical kit by her side, yet again administering Naloxone. The woman is eventually revived - she will survive.",
      "Roz Pichardo returns to Sunshine House, another life saved and another digit to be added to the back pages of her tattered Bible.",

      "\"A hearing will be scheduled in due course for Mr Duterte's initial appearance before the Court.\"",

    "summary": "Negotiators from Israel and Hamas are meeting mediators for the first time since the truce began in January.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in Qatar to join indirect talks between Israel and Hamas on extending the fragile ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "This week, negotiators from both sides have begun meeting mediators for the first time since President Donald Trump took office on 20 January. The 42-day first phase of the Gaza deal and temporary truce came into effect on the eve of his inauguration.",
      "That first phase ultimately saw Hamas return 25 living Israeli hostages and the remains of eight others - in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel \u2013 as well as five living Thai hostages. It ended on 1 March.",
      "Israel now hopes the US can advance a plan for a two-month truce extension, which would start with the release of about half of the living hostages still held.",
      "Hamas has so far rejected that, demanding immediate talks on the second phase in the original ceasefire agreement, which would end the war and lead to a full Israeli troop withdrawal.",
      "However, it stated that it was approaching the ongoing discussions in Doha with \"full responsibility and positivity\".",
      "Since the start of this month, Israel has blocked all aid deliveries - including food and fuel - to Gaza, saying it aims to put pressure on Hamas.",
      "Electricity has also been cut to the only desalination plant in the territory providing clean water, so that it is now running at a reduced capacity on generators using fuel reserves.",
      "In response, the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Tuesday that it would restart attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, threatening to throw a key maritime route into chaos once again.",
      "There is growing alarm at the potential impact of Israel blocking goods to Gaza, with some of its allies warning that this could violate international law.",

      "What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "Hamas hostages: Stories of the people taken from Israel",
      "The local UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator, Muhannad Hadi, has stated: \"Any further delays [on aid entering] will further reverse any progress we have managed to achieve during the ceasefire.\"",
      "\"We pray that these matters get resolved urgently,\" a baker, Husam Rustom, told the BBC.",
      "With the halt to supplies of flour and cooking gas, he said his bakery - which had been providing over 2,000 packs of bread a day - had been forced to close as well as several others in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "\"We are exhausted and tired of all this. It's driving us mad,\" said Zeinab al-Bayuk, a grandmother. She added that food prices had been rising rapidly.",
      "Mariam Abu Mukhimer, a student, opposed an extension of the existing truce. \"There needs to be a solution that ends the war,\" she said. \"It's enough!\"",
      "The US has never confirmed it, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 2 March that Witkoff had proposed a temporary extension of the ceasefire until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish holiday of Passover.",
      "According to this plan, which Netanyahu said Israel had accepted, half of the hostages would be released together at the outset, and the other half at the end.",
      "The PM suggested Witkoff had \"even defined his proposal as a corridor for negotiations on the second stage. Israel is ready for this.\"",
      "It is believed that Hamas is still holding up to 24 living hostages in Gaza and the remains of 35 others. An American-Israeli soldier, 21-year-old Edan Alexander, is among those said to be alive. There are also the bodies of four other American citizens.",
      "Hamas has accused Israel of reneging on the original ceasefire deal.",
      "Despite pressure from regional mediators - Qatar and Egypt - as well as the US, it is thought unlikely that the armed group will give up many of the hostages without a full end to fighting in Gaza. It sees them as its major bargaining chips in talks.",
      "For the relatives and supporters of Israelis held captive, these are desperate times.",
      "Since Saturday, some have been camping outside the defence ministry in Tel Aviv to demand an immediate Gaza ceasefire deal that would free everyone in captivity.",
      "\"How can I start processing our personal tragedy when the national trauma is not yet over?\" said Ofri Bibas, the sister of Yarden Bibas, at the protest on Monday evening.",
      "The recent exchanges with Hamas led to the release of her brother and the return of the bodies of her sister-in-law, Shiri, and two young nephews, Ariel and Kfir, who were killed in Gaza.",
      "\"I have 59 brothers and sisters who are in hell,\" Ofri continued - referring to the total remaining number of hostages. \"We received Yarden alive, but Shiri and the children could have been saved. By Passover, everyone must be home, and the only way to bring everyone back is to end the war. Now.\"",
      "A poll for Israel's Channel 13 TV indicates that half of Israelis believe that the US president is more concerned about the fate of the hostages than Netanyahu.",
      "Asked which of the two they thought was more concerned, 50% of respondents said Trump, 29% Netanyahu, and the rest were not sure.",
      "Far-right allies of the prime minister have threatened to collapse his governing coalition if fighting does not resume in Gaza to achieve its war goal of crushing Hamas.",
      "Up to now, both Israel and Hamas have largely refrained from returning to all-out hostilities in the Palestinian territory.",
      "However, recently, Israel has carried out daily strikes. On Tuesday, four men were killed in Wadi Gaza, which is also known as the Netzarim Corridor \u2013 an area from which Israeli forces withdrew as part of the Gaza ceasefire terms.",
      "The Israeli military said its air force had targeted \"several terrorists engaged in suspicious activity posing a threat to [Israeli] troops\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC in Gaza City, the father of one of those killed, Arafat Hana, said his son, Omar, had done nothing wrong.",
      "He said he was with neighbours walking to a displaced people's camp where they had previously stayed to retrieve belongings.",
      "\"They were innocent. They were just going to get mattresses and other things. They weren't carrying rockets!\" said Umm Tareq Obaid, who lived near the men.",
      "The new threats from the Houthis have the potential to end a period of relative calm in the wider region which began with the Gaza ceasefire on 19 January.",
      "Over 15 months from November 2023, they used missiles and drones to attack more than 100 merchant ships, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Many vessels had no connection to Israel. Two sank, one was seized, and four sailors were killed.",
      "The Houthis say they now want \"to pressure the Israeli usurper entity to reopen the crossings to the Gaza Strip and allow the entry of aid, including food and medical supplies\".",
      "However, there has been no immediate sign of ships being targeted.",
      "The attacks led by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, with 251 taken hostage. Most women and children held captive were released during a week-long truce in November 2023.",
      "The unprecedented, deadly assault triggered a war in Gaza that has since killed more than 48,500 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run health ministry which are used by the UN and others."

    "summary": "The infrastructure required to host COP30 in Bel\u00e9m is undermining the cause, campaigners say.",
    "story": [
      "A new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m.",
      "It aims to ease traffic to the city, which will host more than 50,000 people - including world leaders - at the conference in November.",
      "The state government touts the highway's \"sustainable\" credentials, but some locals and conservationists are outraged at the environmental impact.",
      "The Amazon plays a vital role in absorbing carbon for the world and providing biodiversity, and many say this deforestation contradicts the very purpose of a climate summit.",
      "Along the partially built road, lush rainforest towers on either side - a reminder of what was once there. Logs are piled high in the cleared land which stretches more than 13km (8 miles) through the rainforest into Bel\u00e9m.",
      "Diggers and machines carve through the forest floor, paving over wetland to surface the road which will cut through a protected area.",
      "Claudio Verequete lives about 200m from where the road will be. He used to make an income from harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed berries from trees that once occupied the space.",
      "\"Everything was destroyed,\" he says, gesturing at the clearing.",
      "\"Our harvest has already been cut down. We no longer have that income to support our family.\"",
      "He says he has received no compensation from the state government and is currently relying on savings.",
      "He worries the construction of this road will lead to more deforestation in the future, now that the area is more accessible for businesses.",
      "\"Our fear is that one day someone will come here and say: 'Here's some money. We need this area to build a gas station, or to build a warehouse.' And then we'll have to leave.",
      "\"We were born and raised here in the community. Where are we going to go?\"",
      "His community won't be connected to the road, given its walls on either side.",
      "\"For us who live on the side of the highway, there will be no benefits. There will be benefits for the trucks that will pass through. If someone gets sick, and needs to go to the centre of Bel\u00e9m, we won't be able to use it.\"",
      "The road leaves two disconnected areas of protected forest. Scientists are concerned it will fragment the ecosystem and disrupt the movement of wildlife.",
      "Prof Silvia Sardinha is a wildlife vet and researcher at a university animal hospital that overlooks the site of the new highway.",
      "She and her team rehabilitate wild animals with injuries, predominantly caused by humans or vehicles.",
      "Once healed, they release them back into the wild \u2013 something she says will be harder if there is a highway on their doorstep.",
      "\"From the moment of deforestation, there is a loss.",
      "\"We are going to lose an area to release these animals back into the wild, the natural environment of these species,\" she said.",
      "\"Land animals will no longer be able to cross to the other side too, reducing the areas where they can live and breed.\"",
      "The Brazilian president and environment minister say this will be a historic summit because it is \"a COP in the Amazon, not a COP about the Amazon\".",
      "The president says the meeting will provide an opportunity to focus on the needs of the Amazon, show the forest to the world, and present what the federal government has done to protect it.",
      "But Prof Sardinha says that while these conversations will happen \"at a very high level, among business people and government officials\", those living in the Amazon are \"not being heard\".",
      "The state government of Par\u00e1 had touted the idea of this highway, known as Avenida Liberdade, as early as 2012, but it had repeatedly been shelved because of environmental concerns.",
      "Now a host of infrastructure projects have been resurrected or approved to prepare the city for the COP summit.",
      "Adler Silveira, the state government's infrastructure secretary, listed this highway as one of 30 projects happening in the city to \"prepare\" and \"modernise\" it, so \"we can have a legacy for the population and, more importantly, serve people for COP30 in the best possible way\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC, he said it was a \"sustainable highway\" and an \"important mobility intervention\".",
      "He added it would have wildlife crossings for animals to pass over, bike lanes and solar lighting. New hotels are also being built and the port is being redeveloped so cruise ships can dock there to accommodate excess visitors.",
      "Brazil's federal government is investing more than $81m (\u00a362m) to expand the airport capacity from \"seven to 14 million passengers\". A new 500,000 sq-m city park, Parque da Cidade, is under construction. It will include green spaces, restaurants, a sports complex and other facilities for the public to use afterwards.",
      "Some business owners in the city's vast open-air Ver-o-peso market agree that this development will bring opportunities for the city.",
      "\"The city as a whole is being improved, it is being repaired and a lot of people are visiting from other places. It means I can sell more and earn more,\" says Dalci Cardoso da Silva, who runs a leather shoe stall.",
      "He says this is necessary because when he was young, Bel\u00e9m was \"beautiful, well-kept, well cared for\", but it has since been \"abandoned\" and \"neglected\" with \"little interest from the ruling class\".",
      "Jo\u00e3o Alexandre Trindade da Silva, who sells Amazonian herbal medicines in the market, acknowledges that all construction work can cause problems, but he felt the future impact would be worth it.",
      "\"We hope the discussions aren't just on paper and become real actions. And the measures, the decisions taken, really are put into practice so that the planet can breathe a little better, so that the population in the future will have a little cleaner air.\"",
      "That will be the hope of world leaders too who choose to attend the COP30 summit.",
      "Scrutiny is growing over whether flying thousands of them across the world, and the infrastructure required to host them, is undermining the cause.",

      "Romanian far-right populist Calin Georgescu has lost his appeal against a ruling barring him from participating in May's presidential election.",
      "The Constitutional Court issued the final ruling on Tuesday afternoon after deliberating for two hours. It said the decision was unanimous.",
      "The Central Electoral Bureau had earlier rejected Georgescu's candidacy for a rerun of the presidential election in May.",
      "Georgescu had won the first round of last year's presidential vote, but it was annulled after intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in setting up almost 800 TikTok accounts backing him.",

      "Georgescu appealed that verdict the following day.",

      "Earlier in the evening, many of the protesters outside the court had Romanian flags draped around their shoulders. Some held up Orthodox Christian icons and one clutched a large wooden crucifix.",
      "A man dressed in a traditional peasant smock scaled a lamppost with a giant Romanian flag and waved it enthusiastically over the crowd.",
      "They chanted \"Calin Georgescu is president\" and \"freedom\", and condemned the judges as traitors. One woman had a sign that read \"Stop dictatorship\".",
      "It took a while for news of the ruling upholding the ban to reach the crowd. When it did, there were loud \"boos\" directed at the judges inside.",
      "The crowd soon became noisy and angry, saying they had come to the streets to defend democracy.",
      "Calin Georgescu, the man they support, has come from the far-right fringes of Romanian politics, but he is now at the forefront and promises to make Romania great again.",
      "On 26 February, he was detained for questioning on his way to register as a candidate for the May election, prompting tens of thousands of Romanians to take to the streets of Bucharest in protest.",
      "Many Romanians believe he is being blocked by a political elite that is corrupt and remote from the people.",
      "George Simion, an ally of Georgescu and the leader of the far-right opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) wrote on Facebook: \"Shame! You will not defeat us. The people of Romania have awoken. They will win.\"",
      "The presidential election was annulled after Georgescu won the first round in November 2024, when intelligence was released suggesting a giant TikTok promotion campaign for Georgescu had been backed by Russia.",
      "To European leaders and many in Romania it looked like Russia was trying to weaken Europe and undermine its liberal values.",
      "That is still the opinion of many Romanians who fear a man who admires Vladimir Putin and dislikes Nato.",
      "The Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that suggestions that Russia had links to Georgescu were \"absolutely baseless\", and protesters out in Bucharest on Tuesday evening called the claims \"fake news\".",
      "\"I don't care who you vote for, I just want to be able to vote,\" Anna told the BBC.",

      "While Portugal's President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is not obliged to dissolve the assembly, he had made clear that he would if the government lost Tuesday's vote, with fresh elections likely in May.",
      "The confidence motion was tabled by the government itself, after the opposition Socialists announced plans for a parliamentary inquiry into Montenegro's business dealings.",
      "A company called Spinumviva, set up by Lu\u00eds Montenegro, continued to receive sizeable sums from clients he had previously secured, even after he was elected Social Democratic Party (PSD) president and leader of the opposition in 2022, and had transferred ownership to his wife and two sons.",
      "The legality of the transfer to his wife was questioned by the opposition, given that the marriage is one in which assets are jointly held; the couple have since made their sons sole owners.",
      "But questions remain about the sources of the company's income \u2013 which until a few days ago included \u20ac4,500 (\u00a33,800) a month from hotels and casino group Solverde, whose gambling concession is up for review \u2013 as well as the identity of other clients, which the prime minister has declined to reveal, and the services Spinumviva offers.",
      "The prime minister, a trained lawyer, says the firm provides consultancy services relating to data privacy laws, outsourcing work to external experts \u2013 given that his wife is a childminder, one son a student and the other a new graduate.",
      "The Bar Association is now looking into whether the company is illicitly offering services that only lawyers may offer.",
      "In recent days, Montenegro's cabinet has approved a battery of spending and other measures, in what is being seen as a bid to show that it is working hard for the country.",
      "The situation might seem to offer ideal conditions for far-right Chega, the third-largest party in parliament, to renew its attacks on corruption in politics.",
      "Chega also benefited from the resignation of Montenegro's Socialist predecessor, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who is now president of the European Council. His name had come up in a criminal investigation into government contracts, although he has never been made a suspect.",
      "But in recent weeks, Chega has been hit by scandals of its own, with three of its MPs accused of crimes, including one charged with stealing suitcases at Lisbon airport.",
      "Until recently, Lu\u00eds Montenegro's coalition with the conservative People's Party was still ahead of the Socialists in the opinion polls, having narrowly won the 2024 general election a year ago.",
      "However, they are now trailing the Socialists, led by Pedro Nuno Santos, who served as a minister under Ant\u00f3nio Costa.",
      "None of the major parties appear keen on a snap election \u2013 not least because they fear voters will not be enthusiastic at having to choose a new government when the current one has been in office for less than a year \u2013 and the timing is poor in geopolitical terms.",
      "However, Portugal appears set on an unswerving path for May elections.",
      "Not only has the prime minister chosen to appeal to voters rather than face an inquiry, a stance described as \"cowardly\" by the leader of the opposition.",
      "But Pedro Nuno Santos has long pledged not to vote in favour of any government confidence motion.",

The theory is that Russia - the bigger, more populous and militarily more self-sufficient power - could use a truce without first establishing concessions to consolidate its forces, string out a negotiation process and wait to see what happens politically for Trump during his term while it holds on to everything it seized; and even then try to take more ground, building on its current occupation and potentially using a fracture in the Western alliance to threaten more of Europe.",
      "The process of negotiating terms before a ceasefire in conflicts can be important to ensure the sides convert current military threats into meaningful strategic gains.",
      "Zelensky has previously tried to persuade the Americans that Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be trusted, evidenced by the fact he broke the European-backed Minsk agreements after seizing Ukrainian territory in 2014.",
      "Trump dismisses these concerns, saying there will be security for Ukraine, but without saying how this will be assured. He has said Putin will be deterred and is in a difficult position with \"no choice\" but to make a deal for reasons that \"only I know\".",

      "Critically, it also means Washington will once again share its intelligence data and satellite pictures with Kyiv, which helps it target Russian positions. The White House said it suspended this aid because it felt Zelensky wasn't \"committed\" to Trump's peace plan.",
      "The Ukrainian leader had tried to voice his concerns based on some of the reasons above when he was ejected from the Oval Office. His reservations are likely being set aside while he welcomes the agreement in this form - a necessary price to pay to restore US security assistance.",

The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives from Russia. The Ukrainian delegation reiterated that European partners shall be involved in the peace process.\"",
      "Analysis: This paragraph is confusing because it's unclear whether it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and the US on establishing any security guarantees for Ukraine, or if it refers to negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to permanently end the war once a ceasefire is under way.",
      "If it is the former, it appears to suggest that Washington and Kyiv will hammer out any decisions on how to back up Ukraine's security and deter Russian breaches of a truce, and the US will then discuss these with Moscow.",
      "But it is all a far cry from the kind of security guarantee Zelensky ultimately wanted, which was membership of Nato, which Trump has said won't happen - a major long-term concession to Moscow's demands.",

    "summary": "Stock market falls, tariffs and other changes are reigniting fear of economic downturn in the US.",
    "story": [
      "During his election campaign last year, Donald Trump promised Americans he would usher in a new era of prosperity.",
      "Now two months into his presidency, he's painting a slightly different picture.",
      "He has warned that it will be hard to bring down prices and the public should be prepared for a \"little disturbance\" before he can bring back wealth to the US.",
      "Meanwhile, even as the latest figures indicate inflation is easing, analysts say the odds of a downturn are increasing, pointing to his policies.",
      "So is Trump about to trigger a recession in the world's largest economy?",
      "Markets fall and recession risks rise",
      "In the US, a recession is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",
      "A chorus of economic analysts have warned in recent days that the risks of such a scenario are rising.",
      "A JP Morgan report put the chance of recession at 40%, up from 30% at the start of the year, warning that US policy was \"tilting away from growth\", while Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, upped the odds from 15% to 35%, citing tariffs.",
      "The forecasts came as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US sank sharply. It has now fallen to its lowest level since September in a sign of fears about the future.",
      "The market turmoil is being driven partly by concerns about new taxes on imports, called tariffs, which Trump has introduced since he took office.",
      "He has hit products from America's three biggest trade partners with the new duties, and threatened them more widely in moves that analysts believe will increase prices and curb growth.",
      "The latest official inflation figures in the US showed the rate of price increases cooling in February, however.",
      "Prices were up 2.8% over the 12 months to February, down from 3% in January, the Labor Department said.",
      "Still, Trump and his economic advisers have been warning the public to be prepared for some economic pain, while appearing to dismiss the market concerns - a marked change from his first term, when he frequently cited the stock market as a measure of his own success.",
      "\"There will always be changes and adjustments,\" he said last week, in response to pleas from businesses for more certainty.",
      "The posture has increased investor worries about his plans.",
      "Goldman Sachs last week raised its recession bets from 15% to 20%, saying it saw policy changes as \"the key risk\" to the economy. But it noted that the White House still had \"the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious\".",
      "\"If the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further,\" the firm's analysts warned.",
      "Tariffs, uncertainty and slowing growth",
      "For many firms, the biggest question mark is tariffs, which raise costs for US businesses by putting taxes on imports. As Trump unveils tariff plans, many companies are now facing lower profit margins, while holding off on investments and hiring as they try to figure out what the future will look like.",
      "Investors are also worried about big cuts to the government workforce and government spending.",
      "Brian Gardner, chief of Washington policy strategy at the investment bank Stifel, said businesses and investors had thought Trump intended tariffs as a negotiating tool.",
      "\"But what the president and his cabinet are signalling is actually a bigger deal. It's a restructuring of the American economy,\" he said. \"And that's what's been driving markets in the last couple of weeks.\"",
      "The US economy was already undergoing a slowdown, engineered in part by the central bank, which has kept interest rates higher to try to cool activity and stabilise prices.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?Six things that could get more expensive",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Six things that could get more expensive",
      "In recent weeks, some data suggests a more rapid weakening.",
      "Retail sales fell in February, confidence - which had popped after Trump's election on several surveys of consumers and businesses - has fallen, and companies including major airlines, retailers such as Walmart and Target, and manufacturers are warning of a pullback.",
      "Some analysts are worried a drop in the stock market could trigger a further clampdown in spending, especially among higher income households.",
      "That could deliver a major hit to the US economy, which is driven by consumer spending and has grown increasingly dependent on those richer households, as lower income families face pressure from inflation.",
      "The head of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, offered assurances in a speech last week, noting that sentiment had not been a good indicator of behaviour in recent years.",
      "\"Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the US economy continues to be in a good place,\" he said.",
      "But the US economy is currently deeply linked to the rest of the world, warned Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.",
      "\"The fact that tariffs could disrupt that at the same time that there were signs that the US economy was weakening anyway ... is really fuelling recession fears,\" she says.",
      "Stock market in tech ripe for correction",
      "The unease in the stock market isn't all about Trump.",
      "Investors were already jittery about the possibility of a correction, after big gains over the last two years, driven by the sharp run-up in tech stocks fuelled by investor optimism about artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Chipmaker Nvidia, for example, saw its share price jump from less than $15 at the start of 2023 to nearly $150 in November of last year.",
      "That type of rise had stirred debate about an \"AI bubble\" - with investors on high alert for signs of it bursting, which would have a big impact on the stock market, regardless of the dynamics in the wider economy.",
      "Now, with views of the US economy darkening, optimism about AI is getting even harder to sustain.",
      "Tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management wrote on social media this week that his optimism had \"taken a step back\" as the chance of a recession increased \"measurably\" over the past month.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if we enter a recession, it will be extremely difficult for the AI trade to continue,\" he said.",

      "Reflecting back on the Netflix hit based on his own life, there are two things that come to mind for Palestinian comedian Mo Amer.",
      "Pride and hurt.",
      "\"It's very difficult to talk about without breaking down at some point,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "He is the star of the semi-autobiographical show titled Mo, playing the role of Mo Najjar.",
      "The character is a Palestinian refugee learning to adapt to his new world as he seeks to gain US citizenship by navigating a complicated immigration process - all while trying to bring together his cultures and languages.",
      "Making a show so closely tied to his life was \"very taxing\" because of \"the sheer amount of emotion\" involved.",
      "\"I'm extremely proud of it. I put my soul into it and I'm still hurting from making it,\" Mo says.",
      "There was another challenge to navigate - when this second season would be set.",
      "The final episode, which depicts Mo's visit to his family home in the West Bank, is set on 6 October 2023.",
      "That's a day before the armed Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages.",
      "This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Avoiding 7 October in the storyline was \"very intentional\", Mo says.",
      "The show is ultimately \"grounded in comedy\", he says, and episodes set post-attack drew focus away from the storyline and the characters.",
      "\"You weren't really tracking them, the emotions of them,\" says Mo.",
      "'I never lose hope'",
      "Mo says he wanted to keep the \"greater context\" in mind and that focusing on 7 October and its aftermath  \"almost insinuates this just started\".",
      "\"That couldn't be further from the truth,\" he says, referring to the long history of the conflict.",
      "There was a practical consideration too, he says, due to the length of time between filming and release being over a year.",
      "\"That was kind of like scary territory to write about something, and then all these things would happen.",
      "\"And then whatever you had written and composed in the series could be irrelevant.\"",
      "The show has broadly had a positive reception, with the finale being emotional for fans - and Mo.",
      "It tracks the character's journey with his family to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and their experience of life there.",
      "From his perspective, it shows the complicated day-to-day issues Palestinians can face, such as being subjected to closer scrutiny at checkpoints controlled by Israeli soldiers.",
      "Mo's character is also shown being tear-gassed.",
      "The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers.",

      "Palestinians claim the areas for a future independent state and want all the settlements removed.",
      "\"I've gotten so many calls from people just completely in shambles after watching the last episode and how meaningful it was to them to watch,\" Mo says.",
      "He adds it was \"not only Palestinians\" contacting him.",
      "Mo says the final episode - originally 60 minutes long - was \"almost like we filmed a movie\" before it was eventually edited down to 39 minutes.",
      "He says he wanted to cover \"the main strokes\", which included how difficult it can be to enter and live as a Palestinian once there.",
      "\"Immediately, you're not on vacation,\" he says. \"You're on edge, actually.\"",
      "Mo feels there has generally been limited representation of Palestinians in TV and film, which means more pressure on his shoulders.",
      "\"There's a lot of [pressure] from the fans\u2026 more outside voices of what I should say and not say - both Palestinian and non-Palestinian,\" he says.",
      "\"You really have to put the blinders on and stay focused on telling the story that I know and that I've experienced first-hand.\"",
      "Mo says he can't \"walk away\" from being seen as a spokesperson for Palestinians, admitting to feeling \"like public property at this point\".",
      "\"I think that everyone just needs to manage their expectations. But I'm not going to shy away from it,\" he says.",
      "\"Those that agree with me or disagree with me\u2026 it's important to continue the dialogue and have a conversation.\"",

    "summary": "Ruth Marcus, a longtime op-ed writer for the Washington Post, quit on Monday after, she said, her column criticizing owner Jeff Bezos was killed by publisher.",
    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",
      "Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.",

      "Griffin's memoir explores how keeping secrets can lead to shame and how revealing those secrets can be empowering. The book details Griffin's experience with childhood sexual abuse by a teacher, trauma she had suppressed for years.",
      "\"This book is going to help so many other people, particularly people who have suffered any kind of sexual abuse or any kind of shame, reveal for themselves,\" Winfrey said.",

      "\"When you realize that vulnerability is really the power that you have ... it changed so much in my life, in my relationships in every form,\" Griffin said.",
      "Winfrey, who revealed she was raped at age 9 and molested until age 14, connected with Griffin's journey, noting how many women try to maintain perfection while hiding trauma.",
      "\"When you live in this perfect environment, you don't want to have to admit to yourself that something is wrong,\" Winfrey said.",
      "Griffin described how her children helped her recognize she needed to address her past, recalling her daughter saying, \"Mom, you are here, but you're not really here.\"",

    "summary": "Dive deeper into \"The Tell,\" Oprah's latest book club selection, with the \"CBS Mornings\" reading group discussion guide.",
    "story": [
      "Discussion Questions",
      "1. Amy Griffin spent much of her adult life determined to move forward, never letting herself stop to look back. What do you think eventually motivated her to want to revisit her past and then to tell her story? Talk about the courage it takes to confront one's past\u2014and to share it with the world. Have you ever decided to divulge something about yourself that you once felt was impossible to share?",
      "2. Amy was a star student in her small Texas town, and she became a high-achieving businesswoman after arriving in New York. Talk about ambition as a trauma response. Do you think Amy believed she could outwork (and outrun) her past? How can \"The Tell\" serve as a reminder that people who appear to \"have it all\" are not always as they seem?",
      "3. A physical therapist tells Amy: \"There's something your body is telling you that you don't want to hear.\" How did her body's message manifest? What messages has your body sent you over the years? What makes it hard for you to listen to the messages your body sends?",
      "4. John supports Amy's decision to try therapy with Olivia and he works to keep the family's life afloat at home while she takes time to process what she's uncovered. But John also understands his own limits, telling Amy when she needs to find outside support so he can just be her husband. How does he know when to place this boundary? How does Amy react to this? Have you ever had to place a difficult boundary to preserve a relationship?",
      "5. Would you try psychedelic-assisted therapy? Why or why not?",
      "6. \"I needed to find the evidence that would confirm my memories,\" Amy writes in her journal. Why do you think Amy needs others to confirm what she knows to be true?",
      "7. What did you learn from \"The Tell\" and from Amy's sessions with Lauren about how memory works? Consider the distinction between memory storage and memory recall, for instance. What did you find most surprising?",
      "8. \"My daughters were asking me to participate in life, and in our relationship, in a way that I could not.\" How do Amy's children both trigger her memories\u2014and help her heal?",
      "9. For years, Amy remembers so many details around the abuse, but not the abuse itself. She saw clues, but not the full picture of her trauma. How did \"The Tell\" make you consider\u2014or reconsider\u2014your own life events and memories? Is there anything you might be unable or unwilling to remember? Have you ever surprised yourself by \"unlocking\" an unexpected memory?",
      "10. Amy begins to feel that justice will bring her closure. How was Paul's story both a helpful\u2014and unfortunately rare\u2014example for Amy? How does it affect her when she realizes her own story might not have such a tidy or satisfying outcome?",
      "11. What was it like for her to tell her parents? Have you ever had to have a difficult conversation with your parents about your childhood? What did you learn through that conversation\u2014about yourself or about them?",
      "12. Amy was raised in a traditional patriarchal Texas culture. Children were expected to both respect and obey their elders. How do the environments of our childhoods\u2014and the cultures in which we are raised\u2014inform our adult choices? How can our backgrounds influence what we can and cannot face in our personal histories?",
      "13. Amy recognizes the resources and time she was able to devote to both her healing and pursuing her legal case. How are situations of abuse and survival different for those without the same resources? In what ways might financial and class privileges insulate you from pain, or not?",
      "14. At the beginning of her journey, Amy can't \"tell\" her secret to herself. By the end, she's realized \"the telling is the medicine.\" How does telling her story help Amy heal?",
      "15. How does Amy give herself the closure she needs?",
      "16. Who do you think wrote the postcard? Does the writer's identity matter?",
      "17. What was your biggest takeaway from \"The Tell\"?",

The Broadway version is a stand-in for the city's corroded grandeur, and for the studio where, in 1996, a group of old, mostly forgotten Cuban musicians recorded the album.",
      "Justin Cunningham, as Juan de Marcos: \"What follows is the story of a band. Not ours, though we will do our best. Some of what follows is true. Some of it only feels true.\"",
      "The true part: the real person this actor is playing, Juan de Marcos Gonzalez, had already located and brought together the old musicians before music producers Ry Cooder and Nick Gold showed up in Havana. When their plan to make an album pairing Cuban and West African performers fell through, they went with Plan B, and recorded with the group Juan de Marcos had assembled.",
      "\"I was so happy, because they were my idols,\" Juan said. \"You know, I grew up with, you know, listening to their music. And then suddenly, I was the bandleader.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did any of the people involved, including you, have any idea that what became 'Buena Vista Social Club' would be something big?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"They became pop stars. It was like an unbelievable thing.\"",
      "The unexpected and irresistible phenomenon that resulted is the subject of the Oscar-nominated 1999 Wim Wenders documentary.",
      "\"It was just ubiquitous; I mean, you would hear this music everywhere,\" said music journalist and Substack contributor Judy Cantor-Navas, the author of \"Cuba on Record.\" \"To say that, 'Yes, we're listening to this old Cuban music that is suddenly selling millions of albums,' seemed like something that was very unlikely.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think people loved the music so much?\"",
      "\"Cuban music has really appealed to so many different kinds of people,\" said Cantor-Navas. \"They say that it has, you know, the perfect combination of the Afro-Cuban rhythms and the Spanish melodies that came together in Cuba. It's just this very infectious music that, like, gets in your soul.\"",
      "It wasn't just the music they loved. It was who the musicians were \u2013 the improbable last act of their careers. The album won a Grammy, and has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"And they were so happy, you know, because they came back to the stage,\" said Juan de Marcos. \"Because if you are a musician, and you are an artist, you are always an artist, you know? And even when you're retired, you have this small candle in your heart.\"",
      "Singer-dancer Omara Portuondo was 67; singer Ibrahim Ferrer was 70. Other band members were as old as 90. They began touring the world, even singing to me for a \"Sunday Morning\" story 25 years ago. \"I still have to pinch myself to make sure I'm not asleep and dreaming,\" Ferrer said then. \"I never thought I'd have so much success.\"",
      "From the archives: Buena Vista Social Club on its U.S. tour (2000)",
      "The play tells the imagined origin story of the musicians, their careers, and their personal struggles, with hints of romance, decades before their fame late in life.",
      "Marco Ramirez wrote the Broadway show. \"I'm Cuban American. I was born and raised in Miami, but my parents and my family's Cuban,\" he said. \"And so, for me what brought me to this was the music. It was music that I was raised around my entire life.",
      "He was 14 when the album came out: \"This was a moment of intense pride, of us realizing that the world cared about our music, and that these songs that I was used to hearing on my grandfather's little yellow Sony boom box above the washing machine, these were songs that suddenly the whole world cared about. That meant everything to me.\"",
      "Saheem Ali, the director of the show, grew up in Kenya. His father, an airline pilot, brought the album home. He became obsessed with it. \"I kept listening to it on repeat,\" he said. \"Something about the lyrics spoke to me. I learned the lyrics without knowing what I was talking about, 'cause Swahili's my first language.",
      "\"I knew nothing about their stories, absolutely nothing. The first time I knew about the stories was reading Marco's script. That's what excited me about this musical. People are gonna know about them now in a way that young people like me never had a chance to.\"",
      "Brought to life on a Broadway stage, the old songs as they were played in the 1940s and '50s at the actual Buena Vista Social Club, a members-only Havana nightclub for working class Black Cubans. It was shut down after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The events of the Cuban Revolution lurk at the edges of the show.",
      "Playing yesterday's Cuban music on Broadway are some of today's finest Cuban musicians, most of whom now live outside Cuba, because making a living there is tough.",
      "Juan de Marcos said, \"The people going to see the real Cuba, they are going to get a piece of our country when they attend the musical. We have nothing in our country. We don't have oil, we don't have gold, but we have the music, beautiful ladies, good coffee, the best cigars, and the best rum. And the music, which is the most important thing, like food for us.\"",

      "Her TikTok series \"Days of Girlhood\" became a viral sensation, attracting more than one billion views. As her profile grew, the 28-year-old became a regular on red carpets.",
      "Mulvaney said she knew her gender identity from an early age.",
      "\"I knew I was a girl. That was one of the purest thoughts and intentions I've ever had throughout my entire life was to be brought into this world and to, so clearly, know who I was, and then to be told otherwise, is very conflicting,\" she said.",

      "In 2023, Mulvaney joined celebrities partnering with Bud Light for a social media campaign. Her content was singled out by conservatives, leading to widespread backlash and\u00a0boycotts. Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, saw its revenue fall by more than 10% after the campaign was released.",
      "\"It took a lot to not feel guilty about that experience because I felt like it was my fault. And that me taking this one brand deal was affecting trans people globally,\" Mulvaney said. \"I think extremists and transphobic media needed a poster child, but I would've never done anything or taken any deal that I thought could negatively impact me or the community.\"",
      "The experience affected her mental health, she said.",
      "\"It resulted in a lot of suicidal ideation and dissociation,\" Mulvaney said. \"I'm still battling with some of that guilt and that shame, and that dysphoria that was projected onto me during that time.\"",
      "Her new book comes amid renewed debate over transgender rights in the U.S. Last month, a group of transgender people filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order that halted gender marker changes on passports.",
      "For Mulvaney, the executive order doesn't change how she feels.",
      "\"I'm a woman no matter what my passport says. We are not hurting anyone,\" she said. \"We're less than 1% of the population. And the way that they speak about us so often is as if we're taking over cities like Godzilla.\"",
      "\"I am now realizing that this is life or death for a lot of people,\" she added. \"I want every trans person in this country to have the opportunity to thrive. And unfortunately, we're living in a time where it is very hard to do so.\"",

      "Stefon: \"Have you heard of Blacula, the Black Dracula? Well, they have a Jewish Dracula.\"Seth Meyers: \"Oh, what's his name?\"Stefon: \"Sidney Applebaum!\"",
      "Seems like this was the thing John Mulaney was born to do. Raised in Chicago, Mulaney says he grew up feeling that comedy was his destiny. Asked if he has a memory of when he realized that he was funny, Mulaney said, \"Always interesting in these things, 'cause you don't want to sound egotistical, but I don't remember a time when I didn't think I was funny.\"",
      "Not long after graduating from Georgetown, he joined \"SNL,\" and a career was launched. He made his mark in New York, but he's fascinated with Southern California, where he now lives year-round.",
      "He took us record shopping at one of his favorite places, the legendary Amoeba Music in Hollywood.",
      "I asked, \"When you come out to places like this, do people come up to you? Or do they leave you alone?\"",
      "\"A little bit,\" he said. \"My joke is that I'm like Louis Farrakhan: I mean a lot to a small group of people.\"",
      "Truth is, Mulaney is a lot bigger than he'll admit. In his most recent special, \"Baby J,\" he played to a sold-out crowd and focused on his drug addiction, and recovery. He describes a 2020 intervention on his behalf staged by friends like Seth Meyers and Fred Armisen: \"Let me just call this out now, I don't mean to be weird, it was a star-studded intervention.\"",
      "It's funny now, of course: Mulaney says he's been clean for more than four years.",
      "Asked if sobriety is something he thinks about every day, Mulaney replied, \"Well, that's a good question. I don't think about cocaine, opioids, and benzodiazeprine every day. I'll acknowledge that I understand the vigilance I need. I do not think about it every day. I just don't. I do think about the ways that I can lead my life to perhaps never feel the kind of strain that got me there. So, yeah, sobriety maybe being, like, a bigger term than just abstaining from the chemicals, I definitely think about it every day.\"",
      "Mulaney credits his wife, actress Olivia Munn, with helping him navigate his recovery. You might remember her from Aaron Sorkin's \"The Newsroom,\" or \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" in which she played Psylocke. But she's a bit of a superhero in real life as well; she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023, and has shared her whole journey online, from the initial test to a double mastectomy. Other women have since credited her with saving their lives.",
      "Mulaney said, \"There's this lifetime risk assessment test that is really the only reason her cancer was discovered. And seeing so many women publicly and privately come to her that [say] they discovered how high their risk was from that, it's astonishing.\"",
      "She's also mom to their two young children, Malcom and Mei. \"I have this feeling a lot of times, I go, 'I can't believe I know this person, let alone am married to her,'\" he said.",
      "Fatherhood has given him not only new material, but also a whole new outlook on life.",
      "From his November 2024 monologue on \"Saturday Night Live\":",
      "\"My wife and I just welcomed a baby girl into our family. \u2026 My wife takes care of the five-week-old, and I take the two-year-old out. And that's not fair. That's not an equal distribution of labor at all. Saying, 'You have a five-week-old, I'll take a two-year-old,' that's like saying, 'I'll transport this convict across state lines. You hold a potato.'\"",
      "John Mulaney has made a good life making people laugh. Now, as a husband and father of two, he says he has something to live for.",
      "Asked how fatherhood has changed how he looks at the world, Mulaney replied, \"I'm in the world now that I'm a father. My head was my only home before that. When my son was born, the first thought I had was, I went, 'Oh, there you are.' And when my daughter was born, I had this \u2013 not to sound 'woo-woo' or anything \u2013 but when she was born, I went, 'Oh!' My thought was like, 'Oh, we've met before. I've collided with you some other time.' So, it's like these people came in that just, I don't know, make me like the world a lot more.\"",

    "title": "Lindsey Vonn on skiing the comeback trail",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-vonn-on-skiing-the-comeback-trail/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 09:58:42 -0400",
    "summary": "In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. Fast, fearless and resilient, Lindsey Vonn fought her way back after every crash, until she retired at 34. But now, with a titanium knee replacement, she is eyeing one more trip to the Olympics.",
    "story": [
      "For Lindsey Vonn, it was a reluctant farewell \u2013 the last run of her stellar career, at the Alpine World Ski Championships in Are, Sweden, in 2019. In the world of alpine skiing, few have been more decorated. She's won almost every major title, from World Cup Championships to Olympic medals, as the trophy case in her home proves.",
      "She says when she's racing, she doesn't think about the achievements: \"I think you just have a different perspective. You're focused on the next one, racing and performance, and you never really get to look back and say, 'Hey, good job,' you know?\"",
      "She was fast, reaching speeds of up to 85 mph. She was also fearless, and resilient. Crash after terrible crash, she always fought her way back. But 2013 was one of her hardest seasons. Vonn's right knee bore the brunt of a crash in the World Cup Super-G, and it was never the same. Flash forward almost six years, on the day of her last race \u2013 bum knee and all \u2013 she still managed to take home the bronze.",
      "At 34, Lindsey Vonn was retired.",
      "\"Skiing was always my sun, and everything in my life revolved around it: What time I woke up, what I ate, when I went to bed. It was all dictated around what's best for my skiing career,\" she said. \"And then, I woke up one day and my sun is gone.\"",
      "Ski racing is all Vonn ever wanted. Her dad, a former alpine skier himself, moved the family from Minnesota to Vail, Colorado, just so that Lindsey could train for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Those same slopes she now sees from her home in Park City, Utah.",
      "\"This is kind of just where I go to, you know, re-group and recharge my batteries,\" she said. \"And the dogs love it.\"",
      "In retirement, Vonn has kept many of her corporate sponsors, which helped her buy homes in Miami and Beverly Hills. She continued to wow red carpets, and not racing gave her more time to pour into her foundation, helping under-served girls achieve their own athletic dreams.",
      "But that knee kept getting worse. \"I just couldn't do the things I love to do anymore,\" she said. \"It was really bad. I couldn't straighten it all the way. I couldn't flex it all the way. And so, I was just stuck in this half-state that ended up causing hip pain, back pain, neck pain. It wasn't just my knee, unfortunately. It was kind of everything. It's like you get to the end of your rope and you gotta make a decision. So, I did.\"",
      "A knee replacement \u2013 the outer portion of her right knee is now titanium.",
      "But she didn't do it just to get back into skiing. \"I don't need to ski,\" she said. \"I am Lindsey. I am not a skier; I'm a person that loves to ski. And that's a really big distinction for me, in my mind, in my heart.\"",
      "I asked, \"How soon afterwards did you wonder how far you could push it?\"",
      "\"It was pretty quickly after!\" she laughed.",
      "Only four months, in fact. She took her coaches to New Zealand to acquaint her new knee with her old sport. \"It just was such a drastic difference that I thought, well, if I can do all of these things that used to hurt me before, where would that take me? And my mind starts to wander, and here we are.\"",
      "And where she is, is back on the U.S. ski team, hoping to qualify for one more trip to the Olympics: Italy 2026.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "She admits there has been some good-natured ribbing: \"For sure. There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate! But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "She knew there would be some raised eyebrows, but she got more than that, with some critics going so far as to question her sanity. \"These past few weeks have been tough,\" she posted on Instagram last month. \"I know they are only a few voices out of many\u2026 But it still hurts.\"",
      "A post shared by L I N D S E Y  \u2022  V O N N (@lindseyvonn)",
      "She told us, \"What I didn't expect was people to criticize me as a person and why I'm doing it, and that I can't handle life outside of ski racing.\"",
      "She dismisses most of it, choosing to concentrate on training smarter, not harder. \"It's not like I'm preparing for another ten years of my skiing career,\" she said. \"I'm just preparing for one year, for literally two races.\"",
      "She's put the rest of her life on hold for the moment \u2013 a single goal does require a singularity of focus, much like making her banana bread does. And there's a purpose to that: \"I need to put on weight, man,\" she said. \"I'm about 20 pounds less than when I was racing before.\"",
      "That brand of determination, she says, came from her mom, Lindy Lund. \"She would have given anything to play tennis, to play squash, to ride a bike, and she couldn't,\" Vonn said.",
      "Her mom suffered a stroke while pregnant with Lindsey in 1984. It was debilitating, but she soldiered on without complaint. When she was diagnosed with ALS (once known as Lou Gehrig's Disease), she \u2013 like her daughter \u2013 wasn't about to give up. \"She thought that she could beat the odds, and she could be the one that would live 20 more years, and she lasted one,\" Vonn said. \"Man, it was hard. I still got her number in my phone. I still message her.\"",
      "She said her mom would want her to be flying high once again, even though winning another downhill will be an uphill battle. In a sport measured in hundredths of a second, the difference between first and last can be miniscule. But on this second go-around, Lindsey Vonn is taking time to savor the view just as much as the chase.",
      "\"The fact that I'm even talking about going to the Olympics right now is something I never thought I would ever do,\" she said. \"So, I'm already winning!\"",

      "Daffodils",
      "Sprouting in beautiful shades of yellow, orange, peach, white, cream, and even pink, daffodils\u2014known by their botanical name Narcissus\u2014are an early sign that spring has sprung.",
      "Some tried-and-true cultivars are the 'Golden Ducat', 'Rip Van Winkle', and 'Petit Four'\u2014all examples of the double daffodil, featuring one or more flowers to a stem. Another common variety is the trumpet daffodil, which has a center that is as long or longer than its petals. Large-cupped daffodils are defined by their prominent cups, while small-cup iterations have short cups that are less than one-third the length of the petals.",
      "Don't worry about recognizing all the different varieties; just choose what you like from your local garden center or online resource. Because no matter the type, daffodils (and other small bulbs) are so rewarding. The blooms last for two or three weeks in the garden and bring such color to your landscape. They are also low maintenance.",
      "Here are some tips to help you make the most of these perennial crowd-pleasers.",
      "Daffodils are winter-hardy in zones 3 through 8 and will return to bloom again year after year so long as they are planted in full or partial sun and in any soil that's not soggy.If your goal is to have drifts of daffodils, include varieties recommended for naturalizing and forming carpets on lawns and into woodlands. That way, the 100 bulbs you plant this fall will gradually multiply to 300, then 600, then 1,000, and so on.When planting en masse, it helps to create a planting \"map\" in advance on paper that can be transferred onto the ground with granular lime, as Martha does (see photo).Daffodil bulbs should be planted about two to three times as deep as the bulbs are high, so if you have one that's 2 inches tall, plant it 4 to 6 inches below the top of the soil.When harvesting for arrangements, grasp the stem at the base and pull rather than cutting, as viruses in bulbs can be passed along to other plants when using pruners to trim stems.Don't cut back daffodils too soon. Once the flowers bloom and fade, allow the whole plant to die back to the ground to create food for the bulbs so they can multiply.After removing spent foliage, apply a balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer over the entire area, and then add a layer of mulch. Fertilize the area again in the fall.",

      "It is nowhere you chose to be, and yet here you are. Papa steers your shoulders into the heart of the jack drive. Hundreds of rabbits stare at you through the wire around the fence posts. It feels like looking into the mirror. They do not want to be in this story either. Men have been working since dawn to herd the wild jacks into this pen. The town has gathered to solve the problem of the rabbits, who chew through rangeland and cropland, who eat the golden wheat your papa turns into money. Worse than the locusts, says Papa. Every hide brings a penny bounty. So many turnipy sweating bodies and a festive feeling in the air like a penny rubbed between two fingers, like blood shocked into a socket. A smell that reminds you of the room where babies are born. When you try to turn and run away, Papa grabs you. There's Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Waldowko, Mr. Zalewski, Mrs. Haage. You can't remember any more names. A hundred jointed arms come swinging into the pen that is alive with jackrabbits, the place of no escape. Now there is only madness. Terror of cudgels, terror of ax handles and hammers, terror of being trampled. \"Papa! Help! Stop!\" Rabbits run over your feet. \"Settle down, Harp\u2014\u00ad \" Papa is angry. He pours your name over your head like scalding water. The rabbits are angry. The rabbits are crying and dying, the clubs coming down, down, down. \"If you ain't gonna help, stay clear of us, boy\u2014\u00ad \" You are six today. Your family will have a party after supper. The cake was cooling when you left for town. You feel sick thinking about it. Cherries come slopping out of the rabbits. Gray skins are splitting, slipping under bootheels and wooden bats. Papa shows you what to target: the skulls and the spines of the screaming jacks. It's the fastest way to stop their screaming. There is another way, a voice cries out inside you. Smash it flat. You watch Papa click into his rhythm and begin to kill alongside the rest of the men.",
      "You meet your baby sister's gaze through the fan of her clean fingers. Lada is sitting on your mother's lap. Three girls you know are watching from outside the fence. The girls are allowed to squeal and shield their faces. You wish you were a girl with them. Down, down, down come the clubs and the planks. Your stomach bulges and flattens. You are screaming with the rabbits. Your birthday wish is to get to the end of this sound. Quiet comes at last. The men's arms rest against their sides like tools in a shed. Women are hanging the dead jacks to dry by their long ears. Every twitching rabbit's foot has stilled. Inside of you, the screaming continues. It goes on and on and on. Papa finds you where you have hidden your eyes behind your hands, your tears inside your palms. \"We can't let the jacks overrun the whole prairie. No one likes it, Son.\" This is a lie. Many had liked it. You shut your eyes along with the dead rabbits, because you did not want to see whose faces were smiling.",
      "\"Here,\" says Papa. \"One is still living. You cannot be softhearted, Harp.\"",
      "Your father puts the club in your hands. And after that, you are always afraid.",

      "It starts, very charmingly, with the planning for a wedding at a summer house in Montana. Cece is about to marry Charlie, but then Charlie's best friend shows up, and their plans veer off in ways nobody expects.",

      "By the time it occurred to Cece that her mother was dying, she was dead. Even then, it seemed like possibly a mistake, like there was no way in hell her mother would have agreed to it. Cece hunched through the memorial service, unable to speak or move or smile. People hugged her, one after another, a series of random blows. At the national cemetery, she stood on the perfect lawn rolling down to a smudge of ocean in the distance, the tombstones a run of dominoes waiting to be tipped, feeling like she'd been beamed to an alien planet. She could not fathom her own fingers. It was a military burial, with guards of honor and a flag-folding ceremony and a lone bugler playing \"Taps.\" The long, sorrowful notes floated over the cemetery, turning everything into the tragic plot point in a movie: the gravesites and their wilting flowers, the guards of honor frozen like statues, the hole in the ground where her mother would be lowered and transformed into a skeleton. Such was the grace and beauty of the bugler's playing that Cece, returning to Earth for a moment, couldn't help being moved. It seemed to give form to the precious void inside her. Then the bugler stopped in midnote, as if he'd forgotten what song he was performing. He turned red with embarrassment. Finally, he took the bugle from his lips and shook it, and it played the lost note for a second, as if possessed by a ghost. It wasn't a real instrument at all, Cece realized, but a stereo made to look like one. The thing had run out of charge. A couple of the mourners giggled. Cece glanced behind her, startled. Later, in the middle of the eulogy, the bugle began playing again from its case.",
      "Strangeness and sorrow. Strangeness and sorrow. Cece went back to school, amazed that her life still existed.\u00a0My mother is dead,\u00a0she told herself, over and over, not immune to its dramatic value. It was precisely this sense of being in a play or a movie that made her death feel temporary. At any minute the play would end and her mother would be alive again, taking her to the beach like she used to every weekend; Cece would massage her head while they watched stupid shows together, dizzy with the smell of sweat and jojoba oil. (That smell! When Cece was little, she used to suck on her mother's hair, put strands of it in her mouth.) Cece missed her so much it howled through her like a wind. She stopped eating. On the soccer field she stood there shivering, staring at the grass. Her friends, understanding at first, eventually gave up on her, stopped asking her to parties and the Galleria, to bonfires at the beach. When her father wasn't home, Cece sometimes sneaked into his room and stripped the mattress, gazing at the orphaned sweat stain, pale as a shadow, where her mother used to sleep.",
      "Once, the phone rang and Cece picked it up: her mother's hair salon asking to confirm an appointment. \"She died,\" Cece said, perhaps too softly to be heard, because the woman on the phone said, \"I believe so, yes. A coloring. Missed the last one, so wanted to confirm.\" The next day, Cece drove to the hair salon and showed up for the appointment. The hairdresser didn't question who she was. He led her to a chair, then grabbed a book of color swatches and handed it to her. Cece flipped through the book\u2014a rainbow of tiny rabbit's feet\u2014and found one that matched her mother's hair. She smelled the swatch, but of course it smelled like nothing. She cried and cried, for the first time since the funeral. The hairdresser, perhaps used to such things, ignored her. He painted and foiled Cece's hair, then rinsed it out and revealed the hideous product of her grief.",

      "I have always longed to be known, truly known, by another human being. Sometimes we live for years with yearnings that we cannot name. Until a crack appears in the sky and widens and reveals us to ourselves, as the pandemic did, because it was during lockdown that I began to sift through my life and give names to things long unnamed. I vowed at first to make the most of this collective sequestering: if I had no choice but to stay indoors, then I would oil my thinning edges every day, drink eight tall glasses of water, jog on the treadmill, sleep long, luxurious hours, and pat rich serums on my skin. But, only days in, I was spiralling in a bottomless well. Words and warnings swirled and spun, and I felt as if all human progress was swiftly reversing to an ancient stage of confusion: don't touch your face; wash your hands; don't go outside; spray disinfectant; wash your hands; don't go outside; don't touch your face. Did washing my face count as touching? I always used a face towel, but one morning my palm grazed my cheek and I froze, the tap water still running. I was alone in my house in Maryland, in suburban silence, the eerie roads bordered by trees that themselves seemed stilled. No cars drove past. I looked out and saw a herd of deer striding across the clearing of my front yard. About ten deer, or maybe fifteen, nothing like the lone deer I would see from time to time chewing shyly in the grass. I felt frightened of them, their unusual boldness, as though my world was about to be overrun not just by deer but by other lurking creatures I could not imagine. My joints throbbed, and the muscles of my back, and the sides of my neck, as if my body knew too well that we are not made to live like this.",
      "In this new suspended life, I one day found a gray hair on my head. It appeared overnight, near my temple, tightly coiled, and in the bathroom mirror I first thought it was a piece of lint. A single gray hair with a slight sheen to it. I unfurled it to its full length, let it go, and then unfurled it again. I didn't pull it out. I thought: I'm growing old. I'm growing old and the world has changed and I have never been truly known. A rush of raw melancholy brought tears to my eyes. This is all there is, this fragile breathing in and out. Where have all the years gone, and have I made the most of life? But what is the final measure for making the most of life, and how would I know if I have?",

      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

      "Inflation in February rose 2.8% from a year ago, slightly lower than economists had forecast, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "\"Today's inflation report brings some much needed relief for equity markets, averting immediate concerns around stagflation and giving the Fed space to cut policy rates in the coming months if economic data continue to deteriorate,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an analyst note.",
      "Markets have whipsawed in recent weeks, with investors spooked by the Trump administration's protectionist trade policies. In the latest salvo, President Trump on Wednesday increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting immediate threats of retaliation by the European Union and Canada.",
      "\"Trump's tariff policies continue to have a destabilizing effect on markets, with investors left guessing as to which measures will either be added or walked back next,\" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.",
      "The recent market swings followed more warning signals about the economy as Mr. Trump's on-and-off-again rollout of tariffs creates confusion among U.S. households and businesses.",
      "Such tariffs can hurt the economy directly by raising prices for U.S. consumers and gumming up global trade. But even if they end up being milder than feared, all the whipsaw moves could leave U.S. companies and consumers unwilling to invest or spend, and looking to the Fed for a clearer economic outlook.",
      "\"As we entered 2025, investors' main economic worry centered around reflation,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in a research note. \"But as the trade war continues to escalate and as economic policy uncertainty continues to rise, that worry has shifted from inflation to the labor market and the economy as a whole. In that respect, it will take more than a few reassuring inflation reports to ease investors' worries.\"",

    "story": [
      "Inflation in February rose 2.8% on an annual basis, slightly lower than economists had forecast but continuing to signal that price hikes remain elevated despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "By the numbers",

      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump officially increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25% on Wednesday, promising they would help create U.S. factory jobs at a time when his seesawing tariff threats are jolting the stock market and raising fears of an economic slowdown, increased inflation and even a global trade war.",
      "The European Union quickly announced it would retaliate with steps that will take effect April 1.",
      "\"As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros ($28 billion),\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. \"We will always remain open to negotiation. We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs.\"",
      "France's European Affairs Minister Benjamin Haddad said the EU could go even further, adding that a trade war was in no-one's interests, the Reuters news agency reports.",
      "The world's biggest trading bloc was expecting the U.S. tariffs and prepared in advance, but the measures still place great strain on already tense transatlantic relations. Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.",
      "The EU measures will not only cover steel and aluminum products but textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods as well.",
      "British Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said \"all options were on the table\" to respond \"in the national interest,\" according to Reuters.",
      "It also reported that Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the Trump move \"entirely unjustified ... and against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship,\" but he ruled out tit-for-tat duties.",
      "\"Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm, and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation. They are paid by the consumers,\" Albanese told reporters.",
      "Canada also plans to announce\u00a0nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to the U.S. steel and aluminum levies, a senior Canadian government official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak before the announcement.",
      "Mr. Trump removed all exemptions from his 2018 tariffs on the metals, in addition to increasing the tariffs on aluminum from 10%.His moves, based off a February directive, are part of a broader effort to disrupt and transform global commerce.",
      "The president has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging \"reciprocal\" rates starting on April 2.",
      "Mr. Trump told CEOs in the Business Roundtable Tuesday that the tariffs were causing companies to invest in U.S. factories. The 8% drop in the S&P 500 stock index over the past month on fears of deteriorating growth appears unlikely to dissuade him, as Mr. Trump argued that higher tariff rates would be more effective at bringing back factories.",
      "\"The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build,\" Mr. Trump told the group. \"The biggest win is if they move into our country and produce jobs. That's a bigger win than the tariffs themselves, but the tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money to this country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday threatened to put tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada, but reversed course and\u00a0chose to stay with the 25% rate after the province of Ontario suspended plans to put a surcharge on electricity sold to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Trump tariffs history",
      "In many ways, the president is now addressing what he perceives as unfinished business from his first term. Mr. Trump meaningfully increased tariffs, but the revenues collected by the federal government were too small to significantly increase overall inflationary pressures.",
      "Mr. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum were eroded by exemptions. After Canada and Mexico agreed to his demand for a revamped North American trade deal in 2020, they avoided the import taxes on the metals. Other U.S. trading partners had import quotas supplant the tariffs. And the first Trump administration also allowed U.S. companies to request exemptions from the tariffs if, for instance, they couldn't find the steel they needed from domestic producers.",
      "While Mr. Trump's tariffs could help steel and aluminum plants in the U.S., they could raise prices for the manufacturers that use the metals as raw materials. Economists also say the gains to the steel and aluminum industries were more than offset by the cost they imposed on \"downstream'' manufacturers that use their products.",
      "At these downstream companies, production fell by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs in 2021, a loss that exceeded the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, the U.S. International Trade Commission found in 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump sees the tariffs as leading to more domestic factories, and the White House has noted that Volvo, Volkswagen and Honda are all exploring an increase in their U.S. footprint. But the prospect of higher prices, fewer sales and lower profits might cause some companies to refrain from investing in new facilities.",
      "\"If you're an executive in the boardroom, are you really going to tell your board it's the time to expand that assembly line?\" remarked John Murphy, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.",

      "Egg prices were one of the main inflation drivers in January, with the cost jumping 53% from a year earlier. Overall grocery prices rose 1.9% over the same period, with declines in some foods, such as bread and tomatoes, offsetting the surge in egg prices.",
      "Since then, egg prices have receded, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. In a March 11 Fox Business interview, Rollins said egg Prices have declined to an average of $1.85 per dozen, which she credited to the Trump administration's five-point plan to battle the bird flu. A dozen eggs cost about $5 in January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",

      "Washington \u2014 Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's economic policies Tuesday, saying they are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "\"These policies are the most important thing America has ever had,\" Lutnick told CBS News in an interview when asked whether they would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it.\"",
      "But he quickly added, \"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here.\"",
      "Mr. Trump in a recent interview with Fox News declined to rule out that his policies, including increasing tariffs, could cause a recession.",
      "\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's tariff announcements on Canada, Mexico and China have rocked the stock markets and fueled concerns of an economic downturn. Canada received some welcome news Tuesday, after Lutnick told CBS News that the U.S. no longer plans to double tariffs against its northern neighbor on aluminum and steel.",
      "Asked whether the president plans to proceed with the 50% tariffs, Lutnick replied, \"No, that's off, too. So, we're at 25% for steel and aluminum because that's where we were.\"",
      "The one- or two-day tariffs that are ultimately withdrawn have their purpose, Lutnick argued.",
      "\"When you're negotiating with someone and they're not paying attention and they're disagreeing, the president, who's the best dealmaker ever to sit in that chair, he's going to say, 'here's my response,'\" Lutnick said. \"And then all of a sudden, shockingly, they respond.\"",
      "Lutnick said the markets will learn to adjust to Mr. Trump's negotiation tactics.",
      "He denied that there's any chaos in the way the president has been using tariffs to pressure U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"It is not chaotic, and the only one who thinks it's chaotic is someone who's being silly,\" Lutnick said, pointing out that Mr. Trump had warned he'd impose reciprocal tariffs.",
      "As for the sudden announcement of the 50% tariffs on Canada Tuesday morning, Lutnick said, \"He needed to break some guy in Ontario who said he was going to tax American energy 25%. The president of the United States, in the White House says, 'Oh no, you won't,' and breaks him. Breaks him \u2026 by a tweet and a truth (social post). And you think that's chaotic?\"",
      "\"Let the dealmaker make his deals,\" Lutnick said, adding that \"within a short period of time,\" any country negotiating with the U.S. will come to \"realize it doesn't need to do it this way.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:38:30 -0400",
    "summary": "If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
    "story": [
      "Aging 401(k)s are a little like the old clothes in the back of your closet. You know you should do something about them, but there they sit, mostly out of sight and mind.",
      "And so it is with your old 401(k). If deciding what to do with an old 401(k) plan has been on your to-do list for a while, here are the key steps you should take to get it done.",
      "Step 1: See how much you have saved",
      "If your balance in your former employer's 401(k) plan is over $7,000, you can leave the money behind in the old plan or roll the assets into an IRA or your new employer's 401(k).",
      "But if your balance falls below that $7,000 threshold, some of the decision-making may be out of your hands.",
      "Step 2: Decide whether to roll the money or leave it alone",
      "Assuming your balance is over $7,000, your next task is to decide whether to roll the money into an IRA or keep it inside a 401(k).",
      "I often recommend rolling over the assets from a former 401(k) into a no-fee IRA with a topnotch mutual fund company or discount broker. But some people value the extra creditor protections that can accompany 401(k) assets versus IRA assets, while others may prize 401(k)-specific investment options.",
      "If you think you will be better off leaving your money inside a 401(k) rather than rolling it over to an IRA, the next job is to conduct some research on your own 401(k) options.",
      "Even if you do decide to stay with a 401(k), you may need to decide whether you're better off staying put in your former employer's plan or that of your new employer.",
      "Step 3: If rolling over into an IRA, find the right options",
      "If a rollover to an IRA is the way to go, the next step is to identify the right brokerage firm or mutual fund company. Look for a firm that offers a breadth of high-quality investment options with no additional layers of fees for IRA investors. Target-date funds are an elegant, low-maintenance, and underutilized option.",
      "If you decide to roll Roth 401(k) contributions to an IRA or your current employer's 401(k), your new account will be Roth, too, meaning that you won't owe tax on qualified withdrawals.",
      "If you have traditional 401(k) assets, a rollover is also a good time to consider whether to convert those assets to a Roth account at the same time.",
      "Step 4: Fill out the necessary paperwork",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets to an IRA, fill out the paperwork or online form to open the IRA. You'll then request a direct rollover from your 401(k) plan to the new IRA provider.",
      "The process may be a bit more cumbersome if you're rolling over to your current employer's 401(k).",
      "In both cases, make sure your 401(k) provider makes the check payable to the provider and sends it directly to them, rather than to you. If the check is made out to you, 20% of the balance will be withheld for income tax. You'll then have 60 days to get that money deposited into an IRA or another 401(k); if that deadline comes and goes, the distribution will count as a withdrawal and you'll owe ordinary income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you're not 55 or older.",
      "If you've decided to roll over your assets from an old 401(k) to another 401(k) or IRA, you'll also have to determine how you'll allocate those assets.",
      "If all of your retirement assets were in your old 401(k), a sturdy target-date fund is a one-stop, low-maintenance choice that you can hold into retirement. If your old 401(k) is just one of several accounts geared toward retirement, a rollover can be an ideal time to check up on how all the pieces fit together\u2014and where you have holes.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:24:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The policy could lead to hardship for some elderly Americans, Social Security advocates say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate.",
      "The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check.",
      "But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations \u2014 and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid.",
      "\"People generally do not know they are overpaid \u2014 you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount,\" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have.\"",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How many people get overpayments from Social Security?",
      "Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as \"improper,\" which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars.",
      "From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time.",
      "How do overpayments occur?",
      "The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changesSocial Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Beneficiaries don't update their earnings data or alert the agency to other changes",
      "Social Security employees don't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way",
      "Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.",
      "And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.",
      "However, there are cases where seniors receive \"strategic overpayments,\" said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit.",
      "In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.",
      "Some seniors decide, \"'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over\" that limit, Weir said.",
      "But seniors who now opt for a \"strategic overpayment\" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added.",
      "When will the new policy go into effect?",
      "The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27.",
      "The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "What happens to Medicare if your Social Security check is clawed back?",
      "Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue.",
      "It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said.",
      "\"If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare,\" Weir said. \"It's a trickle down effect.\"",
      "What if the clawback causes financial hardship?",
      "Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to\u00a0thousands of dollars. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023.",
      "Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through\u00a0SSA form 632, Weir noted.",
      "\"Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay,\" he said.",
      "You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561.",
      "Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.",
      "\"With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it,\" Weir said on his webcast. \"Always appeal everything.\"",

      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.",
      "In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.",
      "Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped\u00a0the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.",
      "\"People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,\" the agency said.",
      "The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by \"60 Minutes,\"\u00a0KFF Health News\u00a0and other media outlets,",
      "In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A\u00a02022 report\u00a0by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's \"duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.\"",
      "He added, \"We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.\"",
      "Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year.",
      "The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare.",
      "\"This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices \u2014 usually through no fault of their own,\" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. \"Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.\"",
      "Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans.",
      "\"The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check.\"",
      "Social Security cuts",
      "The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.",
      "While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out \"fraud\" from the benefit system.",
      "\"I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,\" he said. \"We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud,\" he added, referring to a false claim that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits.\"",
      "The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement.",
      "\"Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases,\" the group said.",

    "story": [
      "A columnist who has worked at The Washington Post for four decades resigned on Monday after she said the newspaper's management decided not to run her commentary critical of owner Jeff Bezos' new editorial policy.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,\" Ruth Marcus, who has\u00a0worked\u00a0at the newspaper since 1984, wrote in a resignation letter.",
      "Her exit is the latest fallout from the billionaire owner's directive that the Post narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.",
      "The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.",
      "Marcus, who was a finalist for the\u00a0Pulitzer Prize for Commentary\u00a0in 2007, said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.",
      "The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"",
      "While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions \u2014 they're the bosses \u2014 \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.",
      "The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.",
      "Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.",
      "In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.",
      "Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"",
      "The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.",
      "The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists \u2014 among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer \u2014 have left for other jobs.",
      "Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate \u2014 after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris \u2014 led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.",
      "Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"",

      "\"Delta has a sophisticated aircraft maintenance apparatus that is always-on and has many layers to ensure that every aircraft in our fleet is safe to fly by meeting or exceeding standards governed by our regulators,\" a company spokesman told CBS News. \"There is broad consensus by our technical experts that these issues aren't surprising especially for a new, clean-sheet aircraft and pose no major concerns.\"",
      "The airline said while it is aware some A220 carriers may be finding corrosion in the wing-to-body fairing structure, so far Delta mechanics have not found it on their fleet.",
      "JetBlue and Breeze Airways also fly dozens of A220s along with a host of international carriers, including Air Canada, Air France and Swiss Air.",
      "\"We are aware that some areas of the A220 have experienced corrosion and are proactively taking measures to mitigate these concerns,\" a Breeze spokesman told CBS News. \"The safety of our Guests is our first priority, which is why Breeze performs regular maintenance inspections on all of its aircraft to ensure airworthiness.\"",
      "And a JetBlue spokesperson told CBS News, \"All JetBlue aircraft are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure their safety and reliability. JetBlue is working closely with Airbus to proactively address corrosion on certain areas of some A220 aircraft. This does not impact the reliability of our A220 fleet.\"",
      "The A220 was subject to a 2021 airworthiness directive to address corrosion and wear in wing components known as slat tracks that were likely caused by insufficient grease being applied to the component during production. The directive called for additional inspections to monitor the amount of grease applied to the slat tracks.",
      "Sources told CBS News the new issues go beyond the focus of that 2021 order from Transport Canada.",
      "The plane was originally developed by Bombardier as the C-series before being sold to Airbus due to financial headwinds facing Bombardier. The plane is built in Quebec and Mobile, Alabama.",
      "The A220 seats between 100 and 150 passengers with five-seat rows. It's seen as a replacement for larger regional jets like the Embraer 190 and aging Boeing 717 jets.",
      "Because the plane was developed in Canada, it was initially certified by regulators there. The FAA and European Union Aviation Safety Agency validated the certification but would not typically be the lead agency on an issue like this.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 09:24:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Southwest Airlines is ending its free checked bags policy for many passengers. Some experts think customer loyalty could suffer.",
    "story": [
      "Southwest Airlines boasts that its passengers' \"bags fly free\" \u2014 but not for long.",
      "Starting May 28 \u2014 just in time for the busy summer travel season \u2014 only Southwest's most elite Rapid Rewards A-List Preferred members and passengers who book their top-tier Business Select fares will receive two free checked bags. Frequent flyer A-List Members, Southwest-branded credit card holders and other select customers will be allowed one checked bag.",
      "Everyone else will be charged for their first and second checked bags on flights booked on or after May 28, the carrier says.",
      "\"Just another airline\"?",
      "It's a break with Southwest's 54 year history \u2014 one that could undermine customer loyalty to the carrier, according to experts.",
      "\"This is how you destroy a brand. This is how you destroy customer preference. This is how you destroy loyalty. And this, I think, is going to send Southwest into a financial tailspin,\" airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt, of Atmosphere Research Group, told CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"Southwest, with these changes, becomes just another airline.\"",
      "Just last September, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told Van Cleave bags would continue to fly without charge.",
      "\"Bags will still fly free,\" Jordan said. \"It's the third thing customers look for after fare and schedule: Bags fly free, on us. Ninety-seven percent are people who are aware of our policies. So it's a huge consumer advantage. So bags will absolutely fly free.\"",
      "But when pressed if they'd always fly free, he acknowledged, \"Well, never say never. \u2026 It's like saying open seating would never change 20 years ago. Consumer preferences change, but from everything that we see, there's no reason to reconsider this at all, especially right now.\"",
      "\"When 97% of your customers say they fly you because of your 'bags fly free' policy and you make dramatic changes to it, you are telling almost all of your customers, 'Your business doesn't matter to us anymore,'\" Harteveldt said. \"We are watching an airline self-destruct. This is the equivalent of deliberately sailing a ship into an iceberg.\"",
      "The cost of a checked bag hasn't been announced but airline sources say it will be competitive with other carriers.",
      "In comments at a JPMorgan Chase online event, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said Tuesday that Southwest's baggage policy shift is like \"the slaying of a sacred cow,\" while adding that it could boost the discount carrier's profit margins.",
      "\"I view it as a big deal because it feels more a financially driven, results driven airline than it's ever been before,\" he said.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein, who also spoke at the JPMorgan conference, added that he thinks some Southwest customers could now be \"up for grabs\" because of its move away from free bags.",
      "Mounting financial pressure",
      "The move comes as Southwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, has been under intense pressure from an activist investor to improve its financial performance after struggling to keep pace with changing customer preferences post-pandemic.",
      "Southwest recently announced its first ever layoffs, launched its first redeye flights, and intends to end its long-running open seating policy next year. Instead, the airline will offer seat assignments and sell extra legroom seats for an additional fee.",
      "Also announced Tuesday are changes to Southwest's Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program \u2014 increasing the points flyers get for booking higher-priced Business Select fares while reducing the points earned on less expensive \"Wanna Get Away\" and \"Wanna Get Away Plus\" fares. The airline will also start dynamic or variable pricing for points redemption across higher and lower demand flights.",
      "What's more, starting May 28, Southwest will add a heavily discounted basic economy fare class that will guarantee a flyer a seat on a plane but will likely come with restrictions similar to other carriers' basic economy offerings.",
      "In a video statement Tuesday morning, Jordan said the changes \"will help us return to the levels of profitability we all expect, and to support our collective long term success. It's also about adapting to what our customers want.",
      "\"Many things have changed post-Covid: the loss of short-haul demand, a rise in premium demand, and a change in customer preferences.\"",
      "Jordan said the goal is to secure Southwest's future.",
      "\"We are more than the logo on our planes,\" he said. \"Our DNA isn't open seating, or even bags fly free. It's a dedication to service.\"",
      "Harteveldt says, \"More choice is always a good thing. More low fares are always a good thing. And Southwest is large enough that if they use their basic economy fares in the right way, and I believe they will, they may force other airlines to be more aggressive in their pricing.\"",
      "Southwest is the last major U.S. airline to offer a basic economy product, which carriers launched to compete with ultra-low cost airlines like Frontier and Spirit.",
      "While the offerings vary by airline, basic economy tickets often come without an advance seat assignment, tend to be in the last boarding group and may limit the number or size of carry-on luggage. Checked bags and other perks come with a cost. It's been a hit for airlines. United Airlines reported basic economy revenue jumped 20% last year.",
      "\"Southwest Airlines remains committed to its core tenets \u2014 amazing people who deliver great hospitality to all Southwest customers, a strong network with the most nonstop flights within the U.S., and a loyalty program that gives real value to Rapid Rewards Members,\" the carrier said in a statement.",
      "But is that the Southwest that people know?",
      "\"Yes,\" Harteveldt said. \"This change is just so unlike Southwest. And it really is something that I worry could be far more financially damaging to the airline than helpful.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Mar 2025 10:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As bird flu continues to spread, impacting poultry farms and the price of eggs, the Agriculture Department says it's almost doubling the amount spent to combat it.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a major federal investment to help egg and poultry producers bounce back from bird flu losses, finding eggs at a reasonable price \u2014 or any eggs at all \u2014 remains a tough task for shoppers across the U.S.",
      "In January, egg prices rose 15.2%, and economists say they expect prices to continue to rise this year.",
      "The increase is due to the limited number of hens laying eggs right now. There are fewer hens because of federal bird flu control measures. They require farmers to kill their chickens if they discover a bird flu case in a flock \u2014 a process known as \"culling\" \u2014 to try to prevent the viral disease from spreading.",
      "When farmers cull their flocks to prevent the spread of a disease like the bird flu, they are eligible for public money to help them replace the flocks.",
      "Since 2020, the Department of Agriculture has paid $1.1 billion to hundreds of egg producers who had to cull their flocks to stop bird flu from spreading, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data.",
      "Now, the USDA says it will\u00a0send $400 million more to farmers who need new chickens. The agency also says it will pay $500 million for biosecurity measures and $100 million \"for vaccine research, action to reduce regulatory burdens, and exploring temporary import options.\"",
      "Frank Singleton, a spokesperson for Wayne-Sanderson Farms \u2014 the third largest poultry producer in the nation \u2014 is glad the USDA is helping.",
      "He says his company has 23 plants and 2,000 partner farms in seven states, employing 26,000 people across the Southeast and processing 21 million broiler chickens a week for sale of their meat into the consumer market.",
      "Wayne-Sanderson Farms received more than $600,000 from the USDA's bird flu assistance program to replace three flocks the company culled after discovering bird flu cases in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Singleton says the checks are an important investment to help the farms his company sponsors get back on track.",
      "\"It's a partnership with the farmers, and the consumer, and our company, to make sure we can continue to feed America,\" he says. \"It would be very difficult to get a farmer to take a risk like that without a farm partner like Wayne-Sanderson Farms. So that's where we step in. We make sure that we do our part, our due diligence, help them get back up to speed, and work to make sure those funds are available to them.\"",
      "Culling flocks and shielding them from bird flu",
      "The process of culling is arduous. Singleton says his company sprays a foam agent over the affected chickens to kill them quickly.",
      "\"Different farms and different companies have different methods,\" he said. \"We use a humane method to euthanize all the birds. It's all supervised by regulatory folks and our teams.\"",
      "\"Ours is an approved, USDA-approved method where a foaming agent used, and it's very quick,\" Singleton continued. \"So, those birds have to be disposed of. The house itself has to be cleaned up and sanitized. So it's a long process, and it takes awhile for the farmer to get back up and running. So we work with them directly to make sure that happens.\"",
      "Singleton says there are several proactive measures his company is taking to protect farms from exposure in the first place.",
      "Biosecurity measures are so tight for Wayne-Sanderson Farms, our CBS News cameras were not allowed inside a farm or facility.",
      "\"It just takes one vector to infect a flock so, from the time people come to the farm, using disinfectant sprays, wearing coveralls, wearing personal protective gear, goggles, those kinds of things \u2014 limiting the type of people, the number of people,\" Singleton explained. \"We make sure our people have the equipment, they have the chemicals, the disinfectants, and they have the knowledge. ... It's very critical. Every individual has to do their part to make sure that this doesn't happen.\"",
      "His company supports a recent proposal from other egg and poultry industry leaders to allow broiler eggs \u2014 eggs typically used to hatch chicks \u2014 to be used in consumer products amid the national shortage of traditional eggs.",
      "After a law change in 2009 that stipulated that eggs must be refrigerated sooner if sold into the consumer market, broiler egg producers were no longer able to send excess broiler eggs to consumer companies needing them for things like cakes and pies, because broiler eggs are typically stored at a higher temperature during the first 48 hours prior to shipment.",
      "Singleton says his company throws out 560,000 broiler eggs a week \u2014 about 2% of the total 26 million broiler eggs Wayne-Sanderson Farms produces.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration were to allow the broiler eggs to be used in consumer products, Singleton says, it would be a win-win.",
      "\"We certainly want to do our part to help feed the country and (solve) a need where a need is there; certainly (that) would help us from a waste standpoint and just from employees having to work on that particular aspect of it,\" Singleton said. \"So, it's really just a cost savings and an efficiency savings and putting food back into the marketplace for consumers.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Food and Drug Administration says it is still considering the proposal.",
      "A smaller farm's approach in the bird flu saga",
      "Another company currently able to fill the need is a small independent farm in the northern Alabama city of Madison called Southard Farms.",
      "It has been in co-owner Keith Southard's family for five generations. Southard turned the farm into a pasture-raised poultry, egg and pork production operation in 2019 and never dreamed his business would be booming so soon.",
      "He says over the last month, his phone has been ringing off the hook with restaurants seeking eggs.",
      "\"It's been it's been crazy. It's been busy. My phone rings constantly,\" Southard said. \"Huge, huge opportunity for growth, and people are searching now ... not just to find eggs but something different \u2014 to find good eggs, fresh, local, that they don't just depend on a store to provide them; they know where it's coming from.\"",
      "Southard's father grows grows crops on the farm and they in turn use the crops as feed for his chickens.",
      "He has 900 laying hens for eggs and 700 broiler chickens \u2014 or chickens used for meat.",
      "Right now, Southard's hens lay about 400 eggs a week. A few weeks ago, Southard signed a contract with a restaurant in Birmingham to sell it 500 dozen eggs a week. Southard says he expects his total egg production in the next few months will be just under 1,000 dozen a week to meet the demand.",
      "Unlike in traditional egg farms, where laying hens are kept in an indoor warehouse, Southard's chickens live an outdoor lifestyle, rotating regularly onto fresh grass to graze. He says the pasture-raised format keeps his chickens' immune systems stronger.",
      "\"No medicines needed to keep them going. So, we just use nature's benefits,\" Southard says.",
      "However, the outdoor living could make them more susceptible to coming into contact with wild birds that could be carrying the avian (bird) flu.",
      "\"There's always that risk,\" Southard says. \"We just hope that it doesn't affect us.\"",
      "Last year, Southard had to cull his flock after chickens got hit with a bacterial infection, different than bird flu, called mycoplasma. He says the experience was devastating.",
      "\"I noticed a few symptoms, and then within three days, we went from a normal amount of eggs per day to almost zero, and it was very similar symptoms to the avian flu, so (we) immediately took the hens to the state lab for testing ... and once we got the results in, there really wasn't any answer but to just cull the flock and start over,\" Southard recalled.",
      "He said he and his farmhand had to personally kill each chicken by cutting their throats to make it as quick and painless for the birds as possible.",
      "\"Nothing I want to see again, that's for sure,\" Southard said.",
      "Because mycoplasma is not considered a \"highly-pathogenic\" disease, he did not qualify for the USDA's program to receive a check to help him finance the replacement of his chickens.",
      "\"We just bared through it and kept going,\" Southard says.",
      "And kept going he did.",
      "Southard took us to Farm Burger in Huntsville, Alabama, one of the restaurants that uses his chicken meat and eggs. The staff affectionately calls out, \"The Chicken Man's here!\" upon his arrival to deliver his product in person each week.",
      "The restaurant's co-owner and manager says Southard has been a blessing to his business because Southard has kept his prices low at a time when other restaurants in neighboring states have seen egg prices more than double in the last few months.",
      "Low prices for the restaurant also mean costs don't have to be passed on to customers.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal data found some farms received large checks from the USDA indemnity and reimbursement program after culling their flocks last year \u2014 one egg producer received $10 million.",
      "Asked his thoughts about the taxpayer expense, Southard said, \"I think there's probably, there's definitely a question there about when USDA should get involved or not. So, I think that should be looked into to some more, because obviously we see still these big supply problems. So, I don't think we have the right answer yet, but it should be looked into some more.\"",
      "With supply issues and high egg costs expected at least another year, Southard says it's important to protect small farms.",
      "\"Small farmers like us, family farms, play a key role, because it takes away the big consolidation that's happened and spreads out the risk where you have more farms across the state or country and more farmers,\" Southard says. \"So, if one gets hit, it's not as big of an effect on the whole supply chain.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

      "He added, \"Deteriorating indicators like hiring intentions, new job listings and temporary staffing suggest a potential slowdown in employment growth.\"",
      "Notably, the widespread, ongoing cuts across the government sector also aren't reflected in today's report, according to Andy Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert at The Century Foundation. That's because unemployment claims for federal workers can take several weeks to appear in the official government data, he noted.",
      "Although the full impact of those cuts aren't yet visible in the data, federal employment declined by 10,000 last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday. The U.S. has more than 2 million federal workers.",

      "The Fed in January hit the brakes on interest rate cuts, citing persistent inflation. But Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness, which could prompt additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed will receive one more piece of major economic data ahead of its next rate decision meeting, scheduled for March 19, with the Consumer Price Index set to be released on March 12. The CPI likely rose 2.9% last month, slightly easing from January's 3% pace, according to FactSet.",

    "summary": "Powell says the Fed is in no hurry to change course, citing \"uncertainty\" over the impact of the Trump administration economic policies",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that the central bank can remain patient in adjusting its benchmark interest rate, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's economic policies.",
      "Powell said the Trump administration is making policy changes in several areas, including trade, taxes, government spending, immigration and regulation, and added that the \"net effect\" of those changes are what will matter for the economy and the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"While there have been recent developments in some of these areas, especially trade policy, uncertainty around the changes and their likely effects remains high,\" Powell said at a conference in New York. \"As we parse the incoming information, we are focused on separating the signal from the noise as the outlook evolves. We do not need to be in a hurry, and are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"",
      "Most economists say that Trump's plans to slap tariffs on a wide array of imports, including 25% duties on goods from Canada and Mexico that he partially delayed Thursday, will push up prices and slow growth. But many also expect that tax cuts and deregulation could boost the economy.",
      "Powell's comments pushed some traders to pare back their forecasts for how many interest rate cuts the Fed may deliver this year. They had been banking on at least three following a stream of weaker-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. But Powell reiterated the Fed is likely on hold for a while. That sent Treasury yields higher in the bond market.",
      "Rate reductions could help bring down borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans.",
      "President Trump in January pressed the Fed to ease borrowing costs, saying in a speech at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland that he planned to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Inflation expectations are key",
      "In a question and answer session, Powell acknowledged that typically tariffs would cause a \"one-time\" price increase, rather than persistent inflation, and the Fed could ignore such a temporary effect. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday made a similar argument: \"We could get a one-time price adjustment,\" Bessent said, before adding, \"I'm not worried about inflation.\"",
      "Yet Powell also said there were other considerations the Fed has to take into account when deciding whether to keep its rate unchanged, or even raise rates. For example, Powell suggested tariffs might have more than just a one-time impact \"if it turns into a series\" of tariff hikes, or \"if the increases are larger, that would matter.\"",
      "\"What really does matter is what is happening with long-term inflation expectations,\" Powell added. Powell noted that shorter-term expectations have risen, partly out of concern about tariffs, though longer-term expectations have been stable.",
      "Expectations that prices will rise can worsen inflation if they cause consumers and businesses to change their behavior in anticipation. Some companies might charge more when they expect their own costs to increase.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs in his last administration, Powell noted, the Fed ended up reducing its key rate, \"because growth weakened so much.\"",
      "Economists with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley this week forecast that inflation is likely to edge up in 2025, citing the potential impact of tariffs and other Trump administration policies.",
      "\"Larger tariffs are also likely to hit GDP harder through their tax-like effect on disposable income and consumer spending and their effect on financial conditions and uncertainty for businesses,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a report.",
      "The cost of food, shelter and other items remains a top economic issue around the U.S., with the\u00a0soaring cost of eggs\u00a0becoming a national talking point. A recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0found that 77% of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping up with the pace of inflation.",
      "Powell says economy remains solid",
      "Powell said the economy remains mostly healthy despite \"elevated uncertainty.\" He characterized Friday's jobs report, which showed employers added 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, as in line with the \"solid\" gains of the past six months.",
      "He also noted that there were signs consumer spending has slowed compared with the healthy gains in the second half of last year, and said surveys of consumers and businesses \"point to heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\" Further complicating matters, he acknowledged that measures of consumer sentiment \"have not been a good predictor\" of consumer spending in recent years.",
      "The Fed's own beige book, a collection of anecdotes from hundreds of businesses, mentioned uncertainty 47 times in its latest edition released Wednesday, up from just 17 times in January. The Fed publishes the beige book eight times a year.",
      "Powell spoke at a conference organized by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.",
      "President Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariff policy and rapid-fire layoffs of government workers has created a spike in uncertainty among businesses and caused a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Many economists have marked down their estimates for the economy's growth to as low as 1% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.3% in last year's final quarter.",
      "Yet as Fed governor Christopher Waller noted Thursday, there are \"good news\" cuts and \"bad news\" cuts. \"Bad news\" cuts occur if the Fed reduces rates out of concern that the economy is slowing, while \"good news\" reductions are those that reflect a sense by the Fed that inflation is returning to its target of 2%.",
      "Waller added that he still believes it will be possible for the Fed to engineer \"good news\" rate cuts later this year, though he dismissed the potential for a cut at the Fed's next meeting this month.",
      "After cutting its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%, Powell indicated in January that the Fed would pause any further cuts amid signs that inflation has remained stuck above its target. The central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows that prices rose 2.5% in January compared with a year ago. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.6%, the smallest increase since June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/auto-tariffs-should-you-buy-a-car-now-2025-prices/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Mar 2025 15:52:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say you could save thousands of dollars by buying a car now, versus later in 2025 if tariffs are enacted.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a car can be a fraught financial decision even in the best of times. Now, car shoppers are facing the added pressure of deciphering U.S. tariff policy.",
      "On Wednesday, President Trump issued a one-month delay for U.S. automakers on tariffs placed on imports from Canada and Mexico, trading partners that provide many of the car makers' vehicle parts and components. If the 25% levies are enacted, auto manufacturers will face higher costs and are likely to\u00a0pass on some of those price hikes to consumers, industry players say.",
      "The upshot, according to experts, is that consumers who are thinking of buying a car in the next year may want to consider buying a car sooner in 2025 rather than later. If the tariffs eventually take effect, car prices could rise by between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, according to a recent estimate from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it, will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them,\" AEG CEO Patrick Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The timing of the tariffs remain uncertain, and it's possible that Mr. Trump could further delay the import duties on Canada and Mexico, while the U.S. could also shelve the trade measures if the sides reach agreement. Even if the tariffs are ultimately deployed in April, it's unclear how long they might remain in place, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding the import duties, according to Morningstar equity strategist David Whiston.",
      "Spreading the costs",
      "While certain car models source a greater share of their components from Canada and Mexico than others, automakers are expected to spread any added costs they incur across their vehicle lineups.",
      "\"If the tariffs are here, and permanent, by the time we get to summer we'd expect to see higher prices everywhere,\" Tyson Jominy, vice president of analytics at J.D. Power, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That means even U.S.-sourced and assembled vehicles with components that aren't subject to tariffs could see moderate price hikes.",
      "\"If we are talking about 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, prices will go up, and we are expecting most automakers to peanut-butter spread the impact across their entire portfolio, even if the vehicle is built in the U.S.,\" Jominy explained. \"The reality is that every automaker, regardless of where they final assemble, is likely to be affected if these parts tariffs go into effect.\"",
      "Automakers are likely to be strategic about how they implement price hikes in order to mitigate the effect on sales, experts say.",
      "\"Automakers will smooth costs out across their vehicle lineups,\" Edmunds head of insights Jessica Caldwell told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They won't increase one model's price by 40%. They'll figure out ways to spread out the costs in a way that doesn't harm profitability as much, and doesn't kill sales at the same time.\"",
      "When could car prices rise?",
      "Although vehicle prices wouldn't skyrocket overnight if the Canada and Mexico tariffs kick in, they could start to rise by summer, industry analysts say. That means car buyers should seriously consider starting their search now.",
      "Manufacturers with more inventory in stock could push off price hikes for some time, whereas those that are running low could be forced to incorporate them into sales prices earlier. Jominy said the range could be a few weeks to \"many months\" from the time tariffs take effect.",
      "\"If you think you'll need a car within the next several months, you should probably get into the market sooner rather than later,\" Jominy said.",
      "That doesn't mean buying on impulse, and experts urge consumers to do their homework before signing on the dotted line for what is, after all, a major financial decision for most people.",
      "\"But if you're planning to be in market the first half of year, it probably makes sense to speed up what you can and make sure you're ready to go,\" he said.",
      "What about used cars?",
      "When new vehicle prices rise, some buyers turn to the used car market, which in turn can drive up costs in that segment.",
      "\"If something comes to pass on tariffs, we'd expected higher prices on both new and used vehicles,\" Jominy said.",
      "Demand for cars \u2014 and other products impacted by tariffs \u2014 may be pulled forward, experts say. \"Because we don't know what's doing to happen, I would be buying everything that I needed that's an appliance that could have content coming from Canada or Mexico,\" Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's a little bit like eating your lunch at recess. You get the same amount of food \u2014 you just get it earlier,\" he added.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs more than once already, it's unclear if and when auto tariffs will hit. But Robert Handfield, professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University, said for the risk-averse, buying an automobile now versus later in the year is a wise move.",
      "\"He postponed the tariffs for a month to give automakers a little breathing room,\" he said. \"I think it's a good idea to buy now. You'd be able to get in under the wire and save around $4,000 for a regular sedan or up to $10,000 to $12,000 for a truck, which are significant savings.\"",
      "Even if the tariffs never come to fruition, consumers wishing to play it safe can't go wrong by making purchases now, according to Edmunds' Caldwell.",
      "\"Some people don't have the finances to get it wrong. We are stretched thin financially as a country and new vehicle prices aren't cheap, so I can see a lot of people don't want to take the risk,\" she said. \"Sure, it might not happen. But what if it does? Now you're paying how much more that you can't afford.\"",

    "summary": "Union representing TSA workers calls the Department of Homeland Security's decision an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Friday it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with the union representing thousands of frontline workers with the Transportation Security Administration, a decision the TSA union called an \"unprovoked attack.\"",
      "In announcing the decision, DHS criticized the union \u2014 which represents worker responsible for screening airline passengers \u2014 claiming TSA employs more people working full-time on union issues than those \"performing screening functions at 86% of our airports.\"",
      "\"This action will ensure Americans will have more effective and modernized workforces across the nation's transportation networks,\" Homeland Security said in a statement. \"TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.\"",
      "The decision to end collective bargaining was criticized by the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing flight attendants, and Democratic lawmakers, with both claiming that the action will make flying less safe. DHS's decision comes after the agency last year pushed to boost TSA workers' pay, which has historically lagged that of other government employees.",
      "In May 2024, the TSA administrator at the time, David Pekoske, signed the collective bargaining agreement and credited\u00a0pay increases\u00a0that went into effect in 2023 for helping to improve employee retention and morale, areas where TSA has had challenges.",
      "\"Attempting to negate [TSA workers'] legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2013 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, in a statement on Friday.",
      "In the announcement, DHS said poor performers were being allowed to stay on the job and that the agreement was hindering the ability of the organization \"to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe\" \u2014 an assessment that faced immediate pushback from Thompson and the union.",
      "The decision is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel,\" the Association of Flight Attendants said. The group added, \"This will take us back to the days of security at the lowest price with the highest costs for our country.\"",
      "Impact on 47,000 TSA workers",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the TSA workers, said in a statement that the order would strip collective bargaining rights from roughly 47,000 transportation security officers, or TSOs. Those are people responsible for staffing airports around the country and checking to make sure that hundreds of thousands of passengers a day do not carry any weapons or explosives into the secure areas of airports.",
      "The union said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump's administration were violating the right of staffers to join a union. It also said that the reasons the Republican administration had given for the decision \u2014 specifically the criticisms of union activity \u2014 were \"completely fabricated.\"",
      "Instead, the union said, the decision was retaliation for its wider efforts challenging a range of decisions taken by the Trump administration that have affected federal workers.",
      "AFGE represents roughly 800,000 federal government workers in Washington, D.C., and across the country, and it has been pushing back on many of the administration's actions such as firing probationary employees and cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "\"Our union has been out in front challenging this administration's unlawful actions targeting federal workers, both in the legal courts and in the court of public opinion,\" the union said. \"Now our TSA officers are paying the price with this clearly retaliatory action.\"",
      "The decision to end the collective bargaining agreement comes after Trump's administration pushed out Pekoske the day Trump was sworn into office. The TSA does not currently have an administrator or a deputy administrator.",
      "In a note to staff, acting TSA Administrator Adam Stahl said Noem made the decision to rescind officers' collective bargaining rights to align with the Trump administration's \"vision of maximizing government productivity and efficiency and ensuring that our workforce can respond swiftly and effectively to evolving threats.\"",
      "\"By removing the constraints of collective bargaining, TSOs will be able to operate with greater flexibility and responsiveness, ensuring the highest level of security and efficiency in protecting the American public,\" Stahl wrote. \"This determination is made with the TSO in mind, ensuring employee inclusivity and restoring meritocracy to the workforce.\"",
      "Stahl said the agency \"will establish alternative procedures\" to address employee concerns and grievances \"in a fair and transparent manner.\"",
      "\"Anti-union talking points\"",
      "Rep. Thompson criticized the Homeland Security press release, saying the department was using \"flat out wrong anti-union talking points.\" He said the real aim was \"diminishing\" the workforce so \"they can transform it in the mold of Project 2025.\"",
      "\"Attempting to negate their legally binding collective bargaining agreement now makes zero sense \u2014 it will only reduce morale and hamper the workforce,\" Thompson said. \"Since the Biden Administration provided pay increases and a new collective bargaining contract to the workforce, TSA's attrition rates have plummeted.\"",
      "Project 2025 was the conservative governing blueprint that Trump insisted during the 2024 campaign was not part of his agenda. Project 2025 calls for immediately ending the TSA union and eventually privatizing the entire agency.",
      "The TSA was created after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers smuggled knives and box cutters through security to use as weapons as they commandeered four airplanes and slammed them into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center towers and a Pennsylvania field. The TSA's mandate when it was created in November 2001 was to prevent a similar attack in the future.",
      "Air travel since then has undergone a massive overhaul, with passengers and their luggage going through extensive screening at the airport and passenger information generally uploaded to TSA in advance of travel to facilitate screening. Increasingly, the agency has also been using facial recognition technology to scan passengers at checkpoints, leading to criticism by some members of Congress.",

Another key gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs is now projected to reach 2.7%, up from 2.5% in the bank's earlier forecast.",

After dipping to 2.4% in September, the closely watched Consumer Price Index has nosed up, and in January rose to an annual rate of 3% \u2014 higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target and the fourth straight monthly increase. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release CPI data for February on March 12.",
      "Many businesses are also expecting higher prices. As of early February, manufacturers and service firms expected inflation over the next year of 3.5% and 4%, respectively, according to a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey out this week. Companies pointed to stiffer U.S. tariffs on foreign imports, which raise their operating costs, as a major reason they're bracing for higher inflation.",
      "President Trump on Friday again suspended 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the second time he has paused steeper levies on the two largest U.S. trade partners. The White House\u00a0also recently raised tariffs on China by an additional 10% and has vowed to deploy broader \"reciprocal tariffs\" against other nations on April 2.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans on Wednesday that they do not have the votes to approve a House-passed stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with a fast-approaching Friday deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a  partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said, while pushing for a vote on a shorter-term funding measure following a lengthy lunch meeting with his caucus to determine the path forward.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0approved the six-month funding measure\u00a0with the support of just one Democrat on Tuesday. The bill, known as a\u00a0continuing resolution, increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. It also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "With the House passage, the measure is now in the hands of the Senate, where Republicans, with a 53-seat majority, need support from Democrats to reach a 60-vote threshold to propel the measure to passage.",
      "Funding the government is usually a bipartisan effort. But Democrats widely oppose the measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts, while expressing frustration with the spending reductions.",
      "But Democrats aren't generally inclined to let the government shut down, either. And the House opted to cancel votes Wednesday and leave town, in hopes of preventing the Senate from changing the continuing resolution or passing a different version before Friday's deadline.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the House-passed measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk. That Democratic support could come from senators who represent states that President Trump won in November, who face added pressure to work across party lines.",
      "After their lunch meeting Wednesday, Senate Democrats said they want to see a vote on a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. On Monday, the top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11.",
      "\"I think people want to see a vote on the 30-day CR to let the process finish,\" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said after the meeting. \"I think there's still a chance, I believe, to get something done.\"",
      "Schumer then took to the Senate floor to outline that Democrats are \"unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" saying \"we should vote on that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats have limited leverage in the funding fight, and the move to deny votes may be a face-saving measure. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed opposition to the short-term continuing resolution Tuesday, saying it continues to \"punt the problem down the road.\"",
      "\"At this point there's really one solution on the table,\" Thune said, noting that the House-passed stopgap measure keeps the government open and addresses core issues. \"We think it represents the best solution at the moment.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson notched a major win when he kept his conference almost entirely united behind the counting resolution on Tuesday. He said at a news conference after the vote that he's hopeful Democrats will join Republicans to prevent a possible shutdown at week's end.",
      "\"I certainly hope that there are enough Democrats in the Senate who have a conscience who will do the right thing by the American people and take care of business over there,\" the speaker said.",

      "A vote has yet to be scheduled for the final nominee \u2014 Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who is poised to become the ambassador to the United Nations. House Republicans, who are operating with a one-vote majority, can't risk losing another member. Special elections to fill two vacant seats will be held on April 1, creating more breathing room for Stefanik's expected departure.",
      "There are 22 Cabinet positions, each requiring Senate confirmation. CBS News also included the divisive vote for FBI director, which is not a Cabinet role, in our tally.",
      "Republicans largely fell in line, even after some expressed concern about Mr. Trump's more controversial picks, while few Democrats were willing to give them their stamp of approval, especially as the president moved to overhaul the federal agencies that these nominees oversee.",
      "Here's how members of each party voted:",
      "A handful of Democrats supported nearly half of the nominees. Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire each voted for 10 of Mr. Trump's nominees.",
      "Ten Democrats supported only one of Mr. Trump's picks \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who represented Florida in the Senate before his confirmation. Rubio was confirmed hours after Mr. Trump was sworn in and was the only nominee to receive unanimous support. But at least two of the Democrats who only voted for Rubio \u2014 Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland \u2014 have since said they regretted backing him, given the Trump administration's treatment of Ukraine.",
      "Besides Rubio, seven other nominees received significant support from Democrats: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "See more here on how each Democrat voted for every nominee.",
      "Only five of the 53 Republicans in the upper chamber defected to vote against at least one of the president's nominees.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky led the pack with four \"no\" votes. He voted against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Chavez-DeRemer.",
      "Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also voted against Hegseth, forcing Vice President JD Vance to cast a tie-breaking vote. Collins and Murkowski also withheld their support from Kash Patel, who was narrowly confirmed as FBI director.",

    "story": [
      "An activist who led pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University will remain detained in Louisiana following a brief Wednesday court hearing.",
      "Judge Jesse Furman said he would grant a request by Mahmoud Khalil's lawyers allowing them to have privileged phone calls with Khalil at least twice \u2014 today and tomorrow. Khalil was arrested by federal immigration authorities Saturday night at his university-owned apartment. Lawyers said in court Wednesday he was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to another site in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said they have been unable to have privileged communications with him since. They said the detention facility holding Khalil wouldn't allow that type of call until March 20.",
      "The federal judge on Monday temporarily halted Mahmoud Khalil's removal from the U.S., barring the government from deporting him before Wednesday's hearing. Furman did not rule Wednesday on an effort by Khalil's lawyers to have him moved closer to his New York home. In the meantime, Khalil will remain in detention in Louisiana.",
      "Amy Greer, Khalil's attorney, said officials were acting on a State Department order to revoke Khalil's student visa and green card. Khalil was sent to a detention center in Jena, Louisiana. He will not be present at the New York hearing, his lawyers said.",
      "Khalil graduated in December with a master's degree from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. The 30-year-old is married to an American citizen who is eight months pregnant.",
      "Khalil's wife said in a statement that, even before his arrest, \"this last week has been a nightmare.\"",
      "She described experiencing \"an intense and targeted doxxing campaign\" focused on \"spreading false claims about my husband that were simply not based in reality.\" She said Khalil had been seeking legal help for that in the days before a federal agent approached them outside\u00a0 their apartment building and handcuffed Khalil.",
      "President Trump said Monday that Khalil's arrest was just the first \"of many to come\" amid the White House's crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" protesting Israel's war with the terror group Hamas.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Khalil was \"given the privilege of coming to this country to study at one of our nation's finest universities and colleges \u2013 and he took advantage of that opportunity, of that privilege by siding with terrorists.\"",
      "Leavitt alleged that Khalil had distributed flyers on Columbia's campus that were \"pro-Hamas.\"",
      "\"We have a zero-tolerance policy of siding with terrorists, period,\" Leavitt said.",
      "While Khalil has been accused of making statements in support of Hamas, he has not been publicly accused of providing any material support. His lawyers say he's being punished for exercising protected speech.",
      "Khalil's attorneys said Monday in a statement that Khalil was \"chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday morning that the case is \"not about free speech,\" adding \"this is about people that don't have a right to be in the United States to begin with.\"",
      "\"No one has a right to a student visa,\" Rubio said. \"No one has a right to a green card, by the way. So when you apply for student visa or any visa to enter the United States, we have a right to deny you for virtually any reason, but I think being a supporter of Hamas and coming into our universities and turning them upside down, and being complicit and what are clearly crimes of vandalization, complicit in shutting down learning institutions.\"",
      "Shortly after Khalil's arrest, Rubio posted on social media that \"we will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "Khalil's arrest came \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting antisemitism,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.",
      "The arrest was criticized by some students and professors at Columbia University and led to protests\u00a0in Manhattan. Supporters of Khalil also rallied across the street from the courthouse Wednesday, demanding his release.",
      "Katrina Armstrong, the school's interim president, called the arrest and the federal government's suspension of $400 million in federal funds due to alleged antisemitism on campus \"a challenging moment for our community\" in a message to the Columbia University community on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin is \"eliminating all diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental justice offices and positions immediately,\" according to screenshots of an internal memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "The move means the Environmental Justice Divisions within 10 EPA regional offices will be reorganized and eliminated. EPA headquarters already closed its\u00a0Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights in D.C. and placed 168 employees on administrative leave, although it did reinstate a handful of those people.",
      "In the memo, dated Tuesday, March 11, Zeldin said this action is in response to President Trump's executive order on \"ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferences,\" as well as two other executive actions.",
      "The EPA confirmed the closures at regional offices.",
      "\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people,\" Zeldin said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs.\"",
      "\"Our goal at EPA is going to be to remediate these environmental issues directly,\" Zeldin told CBS News at a press availability. \"We're not going to discriminate. We're not going to make people give us 1000 questions about their their background in order to qualify for support, we want everyone to qualify for support.\"",
      "It's not yet clear exactly how many people will lose their jobs with the EPA as a result of the closures. Exact staffing levels across the country are unknown, but sources tell CBS News there were roughly 200 total people employed at environmental justice offices in DC and the 10 regional locations. The EPA confirmed to CBS News that all employees in these regional offices will be placed on administrative leave.",
      "\"Generations of progress are being erased from our federal government,\" said Matthew Tejada, who was the deputy assistant administrator at the Office of Environmental Justice for over a decade before leaving the EPA in December 2023. \"The individuals with institutional knowledge and have long developed connections and trust within these communities are being erased.\"",
      "The EPA established the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights in 1992 under former President George H.W. Bush to address \"disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations.\"",
      "The Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights has undergone several reorganizations throughout the years, but it was broadly expanded in 2022 under former President Joe Biden. In September 2022, the office received a $3 billion grant from the Inflation Reduction Act that allowed it to become a national program with regional offices in 10 locations to expand the department's work within impacted communities that are harmed by environmental pollution.",
      "\"It will be incredibly hard to attract individuals who are brave enough to show their faces to these communities,\" said Tejada, who now serves as the senior vice president of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Many of the neighborhoods served by the regional Environmental Justice offices have a mistrust of the government and restoring that relationship will be nearly impossible, Tejada said.",
      "\"The government is being shut down right in front of us and it is catastrophic and no one is calling it out,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress is staring down a deadline to fund the government by the end of the week, as the familiar threat of a shutdown looms over Washington.",
      "Lawmakers have until the end of the day on Friday, March 14, to fund the government. The House approved a\u00a0short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, largely along party lines on Tuesday, but it remains to be seen whether enough Senate Democrats will join Republicans to get the measure over the finish line.",
      "Here's what to know about the funding fight:",
      "What is a government shutdown, exactly?",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding or funding extensions for federal agencies and programs, resulting in a funding gap that prompts federal agencies to shut down projects and activities. During a shutdown, agencies halt nonessential functions until Congress approves funding and the president signs it into law. Essential services, like air traffic control and law enforcement, continue during a shutdown, but workers go without pay until funding is passed. Shutdowns can also disrupt processing of government benefits, loans and applications and shutter national parks.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have used funding deadlines to their advantage in recent decades, leveraging the threat of a government shutdown to pass spending bills with their priorities attached. But lawmakers generally have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the last funding lapse caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "How does Congress fund the government?",
      "Article I of the Constitution gives \u00a0Congress the power to approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "Congress is tasked annually with approving spending bills before the beginning of the fiscal year on Oct. 1. Under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the president is supposed to submit a budget to Congress by the first Monday of February, outlining how much the executive branch needs for the coming year. The House and Senate budget committees then go on to pass a budget resolution by the middle of April, before the House begins considering the 12 individual appropriations bills drafted by subcommittees to fund different areas of the government, to be concluded by the end of June.",
      "In recent decades, Congress has hardly ever stuck to that timeline. Instead, lawmakers opt almost every year for continuing resolutions that extend funding before ultimately adopting massive bills, known as omnibus packages, in lieu of the 12 appropriations bills to get the new funding over the finish line. Tucked within those omnibus packages are often policies or programs that wouldn't pass if they were taken up in isolation, making them appealing to some lawmakers.",
      "Currently, Congress is still working on the funding process that was meant to be resolved by October of last year. Lawmakers passed a funding patch just ahead of the deadline in late September, giving themselves three more months to reach an agreement on new government funding and pass appropriations bills. Then in December, Congress approved another extension, setting up the March 14 deadline.",
      "What needs to happen this week to prevent a shutdown?",
      "To fund the government and avert a shutdown, both the House and Senate need to pass a stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution, that extends funding. The measure would then go to President Trump for his signature.",
      "House Republicans unveiled a continuing resolution over the weekend, which would extend government funding through September. The stopgap measure would increase defense spending, along with additional funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. The bill also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The House passed the measure on Tuesday with the support of all but one Republican and a single Democrat, after House Democratic leaders worked to keep their caucus united against the bill. The sole Republican opposition came from Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who saw intense criticism from the president over his stance. Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that Massie should be primaried. The president made calls to potential GOP holdouts on the continuing resolution, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "With the House's approval, the measure now goes to the Senate. But the upper chamber poses its own hurdles. Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, but 60 votes are necessary to propel the bill to passage, meaning support from Democrats will be needed. Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk.",
      "Many Democrats have reservations about the six-month stopgap measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts. That's because a continuing resolution, unlike regular appropriations bills, lacks a congressional statement of direction on how funds are to be spent by a department or agency. Democrats have also expressed frustration with the spending reductions in the continuing resolution. But Democrats generally aren't inclined to let the government shut down, and a decision by House Republican leadership to cancel Wednesday's votes and leave town after the stopgap measure passed adds to the pressure on the Senate.",
      "Democrats have signaled in recent days that they prefer a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. The top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11 on Monday. But the Senate would have to send the measure, if approved, back to the House, raising the threat of a shutdown.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "Since the current budget process was enacted in 1976, Congress has prompted 20 funding gaps lasting at least one full day, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Many of those funding lapses were short lived and didn't prompt a shutdown, while a handful have been lengthy funding fights with major political significance and impact. In 2013, a feud over the Affordable Care Act prompted a shutdown. And disagreements over immigration prompted two shutdowns in 2018 \u2014 the second of which marked the most recent government shutdown, and the longest on record.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history started in 2018 and lasted 34 days. The shutdown occurred over an impasse on funding for Mr. Trump's border wall during his first term. But as the fight stretched into the new year, the president signed a bill to reopen the government without his demands being met.",
      "Before the 2018-2019 shutdown, a 1995-1996 shutdown held the record for the longest, at 21 days. The dispute concerned disagreement over spending cuts between President Bill Clinton and then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "As universities around the country race to assess new federal policies geared toward ending programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, one college administrator is in a potentially tricky position.",
      "Lakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College. She is also Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine, served on the university's biological sciences diversity committee, and has written proudly of her school's commitment to diversity.",
      "The university features its diversity efforts prominently on its website and a letter from Chilukuri to incoming students emphasizes the school's \"steadfast adherence to principles that drive equity, inclusion, and an embrace of diversity.\"",
      "\"As we come into the new academic year with the pandemic not quite yet in the rearview mirror, with issues of equity and systemic racism, anti-Blackness and anti-Asian racism yet unresolved, we have before us both opportunity and responsibility,\" Chilukuri wrote in the undated letter. The Internet Archive shows the letter was first posted in late 2021, with minor edits made over the next year. It has since remained as the main body of text on the Sixth College's \"About\" page.",
      "A crackdown on what President Trump and Vance call \"wokeness\" has been a hallmark of their administration's first weeks. Widespread scalebacks of DEI programs in academia, government and across corporations have marked some of the administration's earliest marquee victories.",
      "Vance said in a statement, \"I don't like DEI, and I'm proud of what our administration has done on that front.\"",
      "\"But I love my mother-in-law. If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance said. \"I'll choose instead to focus on her kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\"",
      "Vance added, \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" Chilukuri did not reply to emailed questions. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding. A Feb. 14 \"Dear Colleague\" letter from the Department of Education to schools across the country warned that they risked federal funding if they continued to take race into account when making scholarship or hiring decisions, or include race as a policy factor in any \"other aspects of student, academic and campus life.\"",
      "The administration's anti-DEI campaign led a U.S. attorney to warn the Georgetown Law School that its students wouldn't be considered for jobs at his office unless the school renounced its DEI programs. Mr. Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has removed from its websites most references to diversity and inclusion, and on March 7, the University of Virginia's governing board voted to dissolve its office of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Many corporations have followed suit, including CBS News' parent company Paramount, which in late February ceased using hiring goals related to race, ethnicity, sex or gender, among other policy changes related to DEI.",
      "Vance has been vocal about combatting DEI, speaking about it frequently since his earliest days in politics. In a 2021 speech, Vance, quoting Richard Nixon, said professors are \"the enemy,\" and called on Americans to \"aggressively attack the universities in this country,\" saying \"they care more about diversity, equity and inclusion than they do their own society.\" That view is shared by the president, and the White House has backed it up, issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold federal funding from institutions operating what it calls \"illegal\" DEI programs. It has not clarified exactly what that means.",
      "The president also ordered federal agencies to identify colleges with endowments over $1 billion that might be susceptible to investigation or lawsuits due to their DEI policies. UCSD's endowment is more than $1.4 billion, according to the UC San Diego Foundation's website. Last fiscal year, UCSD received more than $500 million in federal funds for research.",
      "Vance married Chilukuri's daughter Usha in 2014, and the couple have three young children. Vance said in a 2020 podcast interview that Chilukuri took a yearlong sabbatical from her work as a professor to help care for one of her grandchildren. He described Chilukuri and her husband \u2014 also a professor \u2014 as classic, doting grandparents.",
      "\"You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them, like they spoil him and sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren,\" Vance said. \"But it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents, and the evidence on this, by the way, is like super clear.\"",
      "Chilukuri has worked at UCSD for decades, rising through the ranks to become provost in 2018.",
      "\"Professor Chilukuri has a demonstrated record of commitment to undergraduate education, equity, and diversity,\" wrote the university's chancellor and executive vice chancellor in an announcement of her promotion to provost. They called Chilukuri \"a creative and dynamic educator.\"",
      "The popular professor, who also goes by \"Provost Chill\" and \"Dr. C,\" championed DEI initiatives at the school. A 2019 article on the UCSD website examined BILD 60, a class that the school's 2024-2025 catalog lists as satisfying students' DEI course requirement.",
      "The course, called \"Exploring Issues of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Relation to Human Biology,\" was developed because members of the school's Division of Biological Sciences' Diversity Committee, including Chilukuri, \"recognized the need for a course that looked at DEI issues through a scientific lens,\" according to the article.",
      "Her commitment to inclusiveness was apparent long before she was a provost. Former student Kjeld Aamodt recalled fondly taking a freshman year lecture taught by Chilukuri nearly two decades ago.",
      "\"It was a huge class. It was probably 500 people in that class, but I remember feeling like she recognized me and made me feel special, and had a genuine interest in me,\" Aamodt said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Aamodt, now an orthodontist, said Chilukuri was one of just a few professors to leave a lasting impact on him \u2014 repeating, \"verbatim\" he said, some of her teachings to his own children.",
      "\"I remember her being fairly consistent about [diversity and inclusion], even then we were a very diverse student population, a lot of different ethnicities, and all under one roof and one big auditorium, you know, 500 strong,\" Aamodt said. \"And I remember feeling welcomed and observing her being able to connect with people from very different backgrounds, and I got that feeling that she was practicing what she preached.\"",
      "That commitment to diversity is clear in Chilukuri's letter to incoming students. She wrote of the \"opportunity and responsibility\" to address systemic racism:",
      "\"How we embrace both will greatly influence who we are as a college and a community. Whether through our African Black Diaspora Living Learning Community, our Multi-Cultural Living Learning Community, programming through our Student Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Advising, Student Council, Student Organizations, or our Culture Art and Technology core academic program, I invite each of you to be part of the conversation and part of the solution.\"",

This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.\"",

      "The unanticipated results came after huge crowds streamed into the polling station in the capital, Nuuk, throughout the day, warmed by sunny skies.

      "Washington \u2014 The House narrowly approved a stopgap measure Tuesday to keep the government funded through September, with Speaker Mike Johnson managing to largely keep his GOP conference united and pass the measure days ahead of a possible government shutdown.",
      "The House passed the bill in a 217 to 213 vote, with one Republican opposing it and one Democrat supporting it. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the sole Republican \"no\" vote, while Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the lone Democratic \"yes.\"",
      "House Republican leadership unveiled the legislation on Saturday. The bill increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. It also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Congress faces a deadline to fund the government by the end of the day Friday. With the House passage, the bill now goes to the Senate. But the measure will require Democratic support in the GOP-controlled upper chamber, where 60 votes are needed for passage, and some Democrats have held their cards close to their vest.",
      "The House vote",
      "House Republicans, with a razor-thin majority, opted to forge ahead on their own on the continuing resolution, as House Democratic leadership expressed staunch opposition to the measure. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said ahead of the vote that the caucus \"will not be complicit in the Republican effort to hurt the American people.\"",
      "Jeffries called the continuing resolution a \"partisan, reckless spending bill\" and \"an attack\" on veterans, families and seniors.",
      "\"Bipartisan negotiations were underway,\" Jeffries said. \"But when Donald Trump says jump, extreme MAGA Republicans say how high, and he ordered the Republicans to leave the negotiating table to try to jam this far-right extremist bill down the throats of the American people.\"",
      "Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the Democratic conference chair, said House Democrats \"want to support a bipartisan piece of legislation\" and urged House Republicans to work with Democrats.",
      "\"But they have so far been unable and unwilling to do that,\" Aguilar said.",
      "With narrow Republican majorities in the House in recent years, Democrats have repeatedly helped prevent a government shutdown. And historically, the effort to get government funding over the finish line has been bipartisan. But many Democrats had reservations about the GOP-led six-month stopgap measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts.",
      "While a number of House Republicans said they were on the fence about supporting the continuing resolution ahead of the vote, ultimately only Massie voted against the continuing resolution. His opposition earned him a primary threat from President Trump, who wrote in a post on Truth Social that he would \"lead the charge against him.\"",
      "Given Massie's stance, House Republicans couldn't afford to lose any additional votes. Johnson huddled with possible holdouts on the House floor ahead of the vote, including Rep. Andy Ogles and Tim Burchett of Tennessee. The White House worked to rally possible holdouts around the measure, with the president himself making calls to lawmakers, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. Vice President JD Vance also attended the House Republican conference meeting Tuesday morning to make the case for backing the continuing resolution.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson projected confidence heading into the vote, saying at a news conference Tuesday morning that Republicans would have the necessary support for the measure despite the opposition from Democrats. And House leaders told members to leave town after the vote, adding to pressure on the Senate to approve the funding measure.",
      "\"We're going to pass the CR,\" Johnson said, while criticizing Democrats for what he called a \"striking new posture\" on government funding. \"We can do it on our own.\"",
      "Johnson could breathe a sigh of relief on Monday night when the House Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-liners who often oppose continuing resolutions on principle, said its members would back the stopgap funding measure.",
      "\"Contrary to Congress' longtime abuse of this legislative tool, this CR is a paradigm shift,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "The group argued in the statement that the stopgap bill would eliminate the need for an omnibus bill, a massive package filled with earmarks that lawmakers often turn to under time pressure to fund the government. And they said that the temporary funding measure will \"reduce and then freeze spending for the next six months to allow President Trump and his Administration to continue their critical work within the Executive Branch to find and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.\" Some of the hard-liners met with Mr. Trump last week at the White House.",
      "The path forward",
      "With the approval in the House, the measure now goes to the Senate, where support from a number of Democrats will be necessary to pass the continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk. Though many Senate Democrats have spoken out against the stopgap measure, some have kept their powder dry \u2014 keeping the door open to preventing a shutdown if no other options are on the table.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wouldn't weigh in on his caucus' stance, saying ahead of the vote on Tuesday that Senate Democrats would \"wait and see what the House does first.\" Senate Democrats are expected to meet Wednesday to determine their next moves.",
      "Democrats have signaled in recent days that they would prefer a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. The top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11 on Monday. But after the House approved the six-month continuing resolution, and with plans to leave town, their options remain limited.",
      "Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, told CBS News that he supports a short-term \"proper\" stopgap measure to continue the appropriations process, adding in response to the House planning to leave town that \"they like to bully and threaten.\"",

    "summary": "Elon Musk has accused some federal judges of being \"evil\" and said they should be fired after issuing preliminary decisions against the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A pair of federal judges warned Tuesday of continued threats against members of the judiciary amid criticism leveled by Elon Musk and threats of impeachment by Republicans in Congress. They warned such attacks strike at judicial independence.",
      "Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Richard Sullivan, who sit on the federal appeals courts, raised concerns about the increase in threats against judges in a call with reporters hosted by the Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal judiciary.",
      "Sullivan, who chairs the committee on judicial security, said the protection of judges and federal courthouses around the country is a top priority for the judiciary and recent cuts to the U.S. Marshals Service's budget is a concern. The agency provides security for federal courts and judges.",
      "\"Our system of government is premised on three independent branches and a judiciary that can function independently,\" he said. \"That's what makes it work, and so it's crucial that people understand that.\"",
      "Sutton, meanwhile, said that while the types of threats against judges have evolved over time, they arise directly from the fact that they're doing their jobs.",
      "\"We're supposed to say what the law means, and there's 1,000 federal judges out there, we each take that responsibility seriously,\" he said, adding that judges take an oath to interpret the law neutrally and dispassionately. \"It's a shame to see people attacking judges simply for doing their level best to do their job.\"",
      "Sutton and Sullivan both noted that the justice system allows the losing party to appeal an adverse decision from the trial court to an appeals court and then the Supreme Court.",
      "\"We allocate disappointment to half the people that come before us,\" Sutton said. \"Criticism is no surprise. It's part of the job. But I do think when it gets to the level of a threat, it really is about attacking judicial independence, and that's just not good for the system or the country.\"",
      "Sutton is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, and Sullivan sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. Sutton was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was named to the appeals court by President Trump during his first term.",
      "The concerns from the two GOP-appointed judges come as Musk and allies of Mr. Trump have attacked judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration. Musk, who the president said is leading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, has called some members of the judiciary \"evil\" and said they should be \"fired.\"",
      "In a post last month to X, the social media company he owns, Musk claimed the country is witnessing \"an attempted coup of American democracy by radical left activists posing as judges\" and said in another post that there \"need to be some repercussions above zero for judges who make truly terrible decisions.\"",
      "Republicans in the House have also introduced impeachment resolutions against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, Amir Ali and John Bates because of decisions they dislike, which were issued in the early stages of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "The impeachment efforts are unlikely to succeed. Just 15 federal judges have been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "\"Threats to judges are threats to judicial independence. They've been around for a long time. There's lots of different mechanisms. Threats of impeachment \u2014 this is not the first time this has happened,\" Sutton said. \"One thing worth keeping in mind is if we dilute the standards for impeachment, that's not just a problem for judges, that's a problem for all three branches of government.\"",
      "Sullivan said that amid the evolving threat landscape, and as there are more threats to judges, public officials must be responsible in their comments about the system of justice.",
      "\"The reality is that there are a lot of folks who will respond and react perhaps inappropriately based on something they heard or read, and so, I just think it's important for everyone to be responsible in what they say about our process,\" he said.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts separately spoke of the importance of preserving judicial independence in his year-end report closing out 2024. He highlighted four areas that he said threatened the independence of judges: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments.",
      "When it comes to protecting judges from threats, the federal judiciary's Vulnerability Management Program provided services to more than 1,700 judges, 114 retired judges and 235 family members last year, according to the Judicial Conference's annual report, released Tuesday.",
      "The program was established after Congress passed legislation responding to the 2020 killing of the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas at her home in New Jersey. The gunman found the judge's address, pictures of her house and vehicle information online.",

He is intentionally targeting children's hospitals and schools to kill little kids. I mean, this guy's one of the worst guys on the planet. And Donald Trump looks at him as some, somehow like he's his buddy. I don't get it. It is not good for us and our national security. It makes us look weak and we are less safe because of it.\"",

The same day, a federal judge blocked Khalil's deportation and scheduled a court hearing after Khalil's attorney filed a petition challenging the arrest.",
      "The president wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that his administration \"will not tolerate\" what he said is \"pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American\" activity on college campuses across the country, and claimed the protests are being waged by \"paid agitators\" rather than students. As a student at Columbia University last spring, Khalil helped lead demonstrations protesting Israel and the war in Gaza.",
      "\"We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country \u2014 never to return again,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here. We expect every one of America's Colleges and Universities to comply.\"",
      "The president said the Saturday night arrest of Khalil is \"the first arrest of many to come.\"",
      "Last year, Khalil and other Columbia students set up an encampment on the school's main lawn to protest the ongoing war in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, which Israel launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the fighting since, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",

      "\"We will vigorously be pursuing Mahmoud's rights in court, and will continue our efforts to right this terrible and inexcusable \u2014 and calculated \u2014 wrong committed against him,\" Greer said. \"ICE's arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the U.S. government's open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel's assault on Gaza. The U.S. government has made clear that they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress that speech.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism.\" The agency alleged that Khalil \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\" but did not provide any details.",
      "\"The remarks by government officials, including the President, on social media only confirm the purpose \u2014 and illegality \u2014 of Mahmoud's detention. He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment,\" Greer said in a statement Monday evening. \"While tomorrow or thereafter the government may cite the law or process, that toothpaste is out of the tube and irreversibly so. The government's objective is as transparent as it is unlawful, and our role as Mahmoud's lawyers is to ensure it does not prevail.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the Trump administration \"will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Democrats joined Republicans Monday in voting to confirm former GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer as labor secretary, one of the final members of President Trump's Cabinet to win the upper chamber's approval.",
      "Her nomination passed the Senate in a 67 to 32 vote, with 17 Democrats backing her confirmation. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Ted Budd of North Carolina were the only Republicans to oppose her. Chavez-DeRemer served one two-year term in Congress, becoming the first Republican woman elected to Congress in Oregon. Mr. Trump nominated her as labor secretary after she lost her reelection bid in November.",
      "With a history of support for pro-labor policies, Chavez-DeRemer's path to confirmation once appeared threatened. Paul openly opposed her nomination and predicted in January that she'd lose more than a dozen Republican votes. But her confirmation was approved with support on both sides of the aisle Monday.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, a bill that would have made it easier for workers to unionize that was introduced in the last Congress. During her confirmation hearing last month, Chavez-DeRemer addressed her prior support for the bill, saying it was \"imperfect,\" while at the same time backing right-to-work laws that allow workers to choose whether or not to join a union.",
      "Though Paul's opposition threatened to tank Chavez-DeRemer's advancement out of committee last month, three Democrats on the committee ultimately voted to move her nomination forward. And although Democrats haven't been eager to support some of Mr. Trump's nominees amid intense criticism of the administration's work so far, they didn't mount serious opposition to Chavez-DeRemer's confirmation.",
      "Monday's confirmation vote comes after Chavez-DeRemer's nomination cleared a procedural hurdle in a 66-30 vote last week, with 15 Democrats voting with all present Republicans except Paul to advance her nomination.",
      "Though some of her previous views may have conflicted with the administration, Chavez-DeRemer committed during her confirmation hearing to implementing Mr. Trump's policy vision.",
      "\"My guiding principle will be President Trump's guiding principle \u2014 ensuring a level playing field for businesses, unions and, most importantly, the American worker,\" she said.",

    "summary": "The prehistoric facial bones were found buried in 50 feet of mud and silt, and are believed to be 1.1 to 1.4 million years old, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

    "summary": "Intuitive Machines says its Athena lunar lander was unable to recharge its batteries while resting on its side, bringing the moon mission to an early end.",
    "story": [
      "A dramatic photograph from Intuitive Machines' Athena moon lander shows it touched down Thursday in a crater near the lunar south pole and tipped over on its side. Given a low sun angle and the orientation of the lander's solar cells, the spacecraft's battery quickly drained, bringing the mission to an early end, company officials said Friday",
      "\"Images downlinked from Athena on the lunar surface confirmed that Athena was on her side,\" the company said on its website.",
      "\"After landing, mission controllers were able to accelerate several program and payload milestones, including NASA's PRIME-1 (drill) suite, before the lander's batteries depleted,\" the statement continued. \"With the direction of the sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge. The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"",
      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

    "summary": "A study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Butterflies, known for their beauty and vital role in pollination, are vanishing from U.S. landscapes at an alarming rate. A comprehensive study, published Thursday in the journal Science, found that 22% of butterflies in the United States disappeared between 2000 and 2020.",
      "The new research offers a stark warning about the potential future of these cherished insects.",
      "\"Losing one out of every five butterflies over 20 years should be a big wake-up call to people,\" said Dr. Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University and co-author of the study. \"These declines are not stopping.\"",
      "While butterflies are the most extensively monitored insect group in the U.S., most past studies have been limited by geography or focused on specific species, a news release on the study said. The researchers behind the Science study used data from more than 12.6 million butterflies spanning 342 individual species, drawing from 76,000 surveys across 35 nationwide monitoring programs.",
      "Funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, the study was the first to integrate such a vast dataset, its authors said. The findings revealed that 33% of butterfly species have experienced significant population declines over the past two decades, with 107 out of the 342 species examined losing more than half of their population \u2014 including 22 species that declined by more than 90%. Meanwhile, only 3% of species showed population increases.",
      "One of the most striking examples is the monarch butterfly. In December 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the monarch under the Endangered Species Act, saying the species' eastern population has declined by about 80% and the western population has dropped by more than 95% since the 1980s.",
      "The species was already designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022.",
      "Ultimately, the butterfly decline is part of a larger global trend of insect population loss, with insects declining by about 1-2% annually, the study's authors said.",
      "Butterflies play an essential role in ecosystems, pollinating flowers, crops, and other plants. Their decline could have far-reaching impacts on plant reproduction and the health of ecosystems.",
      "According to the Science study, habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use are driving their declines. Rising temperatures and changing climates threaten butterfly populations by disrupting breeding cycles, reducing food sources, and increasing habitat stress. Insecticides have been identified as leading causes of butterfly decline, which can be tackled with policy intervention such as restricting harmful insecticides, promoting integrated pest management and encouraging diversified cropping, according to the study.",
      "Despite the declines, individuals can take steps to help butterfly populations recover, Grames said.",
      "\"One of the really positive messages about insect conservation is that the things we do in our own backyards actually make a difference,\" she said.",
      "She recommends allowing a portion of yards to grow wild with native plants, reducing pesticide use, and creating habitat spaces like small brush piles for insects. \"Even simple actions \u2014 like leaving a strip of wildflowers or planting species that support pollinators \u2014 can provide crucial resources for butterflies and other insects.\"",
      "On a larger scale, experts say conservation efforts, including habitat preservation and climate adaptation strategies, are also essential to protecting vulnerable species and ensuring butterfly populations remain resilient in the face of ongoing environmental changes.",

      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",

    "summary": "Colossal Biosciences has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
    "story": [
      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

      "The full moon reaches peak illumination at 2:55 a.m. ET on Friday, March 14. The total lunar eclipse will make the moon appear red on Thursday, March 13 into the following day, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "When and where to see the \"Blood Worm Moon\"",
      "While this month's full moon will rise early Friday, it will appear full from around Wednesday evening into Saturday morning, according to NASA. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday night at 11:57 p.m. EDT. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",
      "The moon will exit from Earth's full shadow between 3:31 a.m. and 4:48 a.m., and will leave the last of the partial shadow at 6 a.m. ending lunar eclipse.",
      "Viewers in North and South America will catch the best views of the \"Blood Worm Moon,\" though parts of Europe and Africa may catch a glimpse.",
      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "This month's full moon is also called the Worm Moon. The nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",

      "March's full moon, known as the Worm Moon, will pass into Earth's shadow on the night of March 13, or early on March 14, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",

      "A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this March, the entire moon will fall within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "Each lunar eclipse is visible from half of Earth.",
      "There are also partial and penumbral eclipses, which are when the sun, Earth and moon are not perfectly aligned.",
      "Why does the moon look red during the lunar eclipse?",
      "With the moon in the shadow of the Earth, it will appear red-orange, according to NASA. Lunar eclipses are sometimes called blood moons because of the phenomenon.",
      "During a lunar eclipse, the moon gets its red coloration because any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth is filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. The more dust or clouds in Earth's atmosphere during the total lunar eclipse, the redder the moon will appear.",
      "\"It's as if all the world's sunrises and sunsets are projected onto the Moon,\" NASA explains in a blog post.",
      "This is the same phenomenon that makes the sky appear blue during the day.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "The Worm Moon nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the\u00a0Old Farmer's Almanac. Other research suggests the name may date back to writings from the 1760s about worms, or beetle larvae, coming out from bark as trees thaw from the winter.",
      "There are also other names for March's full moon related to the transition from winter to spring. The first day of spring will be on March 20, just days after the Worm Moon.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",
      "What else can you see during the full Blood Worm Moon?",
      "If there's a bit of rain during the full moon, there may be a rare moonbow, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. It's like a rainbow, but created by moonlight, rather than sunlight. Moonbows only happen when the full Moon is fairly low in the sky, so the phenomenon would be most apparent in the hours after sunset when the sky is dark.",
      "Viewers can also look to the western sky on the night of the total lunar eclipse to catch a glimpse of Jupiter and Mars, according to NASA. Constellations may also be easier to spot than usual as Earth's shadow dims the Moon's glow.",

    "summary": "Four fresh crew members bound for the International Space Station will finally enable the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts to head for home.",
    "story": [
      "NASA is finally ready to launch its next space station crew, clearing the way for Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams to head back to Earth more than nine months after they took off on what they thought would be an eight-day stay in space.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov are scheduled for launch from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday. If all goes well, they will catch up with the space station Thursday, moving in for docking at the lab's forward port at 6 a.m.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew 9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 16 for return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew 10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 16 and land as early as March 17. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 285 days \u2014 9.5 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to 170 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew 9 or Crew 8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew 9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew 9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew 10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew 9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew 10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

      "Launched Feb. 26 atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, the Athena lander carried 10 science instruments and technology demonstrations funded by a NASA program that pays commercial spacecraft operators to deliver the agency's payloads to the moon. The goal is to collect data needed before astronauts return to the moon in the 2027-28 timeframe.",
      "In this case, NASA agreed to pay Intuitive Machines $62.5 million to deliver a drill and a mass spectrometer, known as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia cellular communications equipment and another $41 million to help finance an innovative rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to jump into and out of a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice.",
      "Athena performed flawlessly from launch to lunar orbit and most of the way to the lunar surface. But shortly before touchdown, the lander's autonomous guidance and navigation system began steering to one side, presumably to avoid boulders or some other hazard on the surface, and ended up coming down in a crater some 820 feet from the intended target.",
      "The spacecraft may have tipped over after hitting the ground at an angle or due to some residual sideways motion. Intuitive didn't address the final seconds of the landing, but said that even resting on its side, Athena remained functional, acknowledging commands from the ground, downlinking data and attempting to recharge its batteries. But it was not enough.",
      "\"This southern pole region is lit by harsh sun angles and limited direct communication with the Earth,\" Intuitive Machines said on its web page. \"This area has been avoided due to its rugged terrain and Intuitive Machines believes the insights and achievements from IM-2 will open this region for further space exploration.\"",
      "The landing mishap was the second such disappointment for Intuitive Machines. The company's first moon lander, named Odysseus, touched down on the moon last year, but it hit the surface harder than expected and a landing leg failed. The vehicle ended up on its side and unable to complete its mission.",
      "Athena's arrival was preceded by the successful touchdown of a commercial lander built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace that also carried NASA-sponsored payloads to the surface. That spacecraft, known as Blue Ghost, landed Sunday in a different region of the moon with much more forgiving terrain.",
      "A third privately-built lander, this one from Tokyo-based ispace, was launched atop the same Falcon 9 that boosted Blue Ghost into space. The Japanese Resilience lander is taking a longer, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to land in June.",

      "The chopsticks closed around the slowly descending booster, locking onto structural capture fixtures on both sides of the rocket. The dramatic launch pad capture, SpaceX's third, is a key element in the company's plan to enable rapid refurbishment and reuse.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship upper stage, meanwhile, climbed toward space as planned on the power of six Raptor engines, appearing to work flawlessly as it soared skyward toward the planned sub-orbital trajectory.",
      "Trouble 8 minutes after liftoff",

      "Multiple videos posted on social media showed a dramatic shower of debris arcing back toward Earth after the vehicle broke up. It wasn't immediately clear if the breakup was triggered by the Starship's self-destruct system or by extreme structural loads as it fell back into the lower atmosphere.",
      "While SpaceX will no doubt attempt its usual rapid recovery, the Federal Aviation Administration will almost certainly order another failure investigation. Given two destructive breakups in a row, it could take longer to return to flight status this time around.",

      "Telemetry indicated the fire broke out after propellant lines leading to one of the Raptors ruptured due to unexpected harmonic vibrations. SpaceX carried out a 60-second engine test firing of the Starship launched Monday, studying responses to various thrust levels.",
      "Based on the test results, propellant feed lines were modified, fuel temperatures were changed and thrust levels were adjusted to avoid any such harmonic responses.

      "A second commercially-built moon lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed near the moon's south pole Thursday, but telemetry indicated it ended up on its side.",
      "The lander is \"alive,\" Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, but it's not yet known what mission objectives can still be met.",
      "\"We don't believe we're in the correct attitude (orientation) on the surface of the moon yet again,\" Altemus disclosed. \"I don't have all the data yet to say exactly what the attitude of the vehicle is. We're collecting photos now and downlinking those, and we're going to get a picture from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter camera from above, from orbit, and we'll confirm that over the coming days as we get that data down.\"",
      "The touchdown came one year after Intuitive's first moon lander, named Odysseus, landed on the moon while still moving sideways. A landing leg broke and the spacecraft tipped over on its side, limiting the mission's scientific return. Intuitive's stock fell 20% in the wake of the latest landing problem.",
      "Known as Athena, the IM-2 spacecraft from Intuitive Machines\u00a0was launched eight days ago by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Sharing the ride to space were three other spacecraft: a moon-bound NASA orbiter known as the Lunar Trailblazer, a commercial deep space asteroid prospecting probe named Odin, and a privately-built space tug designed to work in Earth orbit.",
      "NASA lost contact with its Lunar Trailblazer satellite shortly after launch, and AstroForge ran into problems commanding its Odin prospector probe. Both payloads are likely lost, officials say.",
      "Athena carried a set of sophisticated instruments, two small rovers, experimental cellular communications gear and a rocket-powered \"hopper\" designed to bounce from site to site near the lander. The lander apparently touched down 100 miles or so from the moon's south pole around 12:30 p.m. EST.",
      "The exact timing and the lander's exact location were not immediately known as company flight controllers worked to evaluate confusing telemetry from the spacecraft.",
      "But they eventually confirmed the spacecraft's main engine had shut down, its solar cells were generating power and the lander's flight computer was in contact with company flight controllers, acknowledging commands as they were received.",
      "Altemus, a former NASA shuttle engineer and senior manager at the Johnson Space Center, said the most reliable information came from the lander's inertial measurement unit, or IMU, which indicated Athena was resting on its side.",
      "\"We think that's the case,\" he said. \"I would like to get a picture, though, to know the orientation of exactly where the antennas are pointed, where the engine bell is pointed, where are the solar panels so that we can figure out a power profile.\"",
      "\"With the payloads, we can talk to them and command them on and off. So if we can figure out the orientation correctly with imagery, we can then develop a power profile (that will) result in a series of priorities in the science and technology list that would allow us to capture some mission objectives.\"",
      "But time is short. The solar-powered Athena will only be able to operate for about 10 days before the sun sets and darkness sweeps over the landing site at the end of the lunar day.",
      "\"When we get that full assessment, we will then work closely with NASA science and technology groups to identify science objectives that are the highest priority,\" Altemus said. \"And then we'll figure out what the mission profile will look. It will be off-nominal because we're not getting everything that we had asked for in terms of power generation, communications, et cetera.\"",
      "The lander braked into orbit Monday, five days after launch from the Kennedy Space Center. Thursday morning, while flying over the far side of the moon, Athena's main engine fired, starting a process to lower the far side of its orbit from about 62 miles to a little more than 6 miles.",
      "During the coast down to lower altitude, the lander presumably used its cameras and lasers in a terrain relative navigation system to constantly monitor altitude and velocity, keeping the spacecraft on course toward the landing site.",
      "As it neared the target, the main engine fired again in a maneuver called powered descent initiation, designed to sharply reduce its initial 4,000-mph velocity. Once the braking maneuver was complete, Athena was programmed to flip upright into a vertical, tail-down orientation for the final phase of the descent, scanning the surface ahead for hazards.",
      "The lander was expected to descend at a sedate 2.2 mph for the final drop to the surface in lunar highlands known as the Mons Mouton region. But the spacecraft autonomously maneuvered to find a safer landing area after evaluating the surface ahead. The details of the final phases of the descent are not yet known.",
      "NASA is targeting the south polar region for astronaut landings, in large part because data from orbiting satellites indicate ice may be present in permanently shadowed craters that never see the light of the sun and are among the coldest spots in the solar system.",
      "The water molecules presumably were delivered over billions of years by comet impacts and interactions between moon dust and the electrically charged solar wind.",
      "The innovative \"Grace\" hopper was designed to jump into one of those dark craters about a quarter of a mile from Athena for in situ measurements, radioing its observations back to the lander using 4G/LTE cellular network equipment provided by Nokia.",
      "Other instruments on the lander were expected to look for the chemical traces of water and other compounds, along with taking measurements of soil temperature and composition. Two small rovers were on board to explore the landing site and to test innovative mobility systems.",
      "Altemus said it may still be possible to deploy the hopper and the rovers, but that will depend on the lander's orientation.",

      "NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million for Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million went to Intuitive Machines to help finance the \"Grace\" hopper.",
      "Another $89 million paid for a lunar satellite built by Lockheed Martin that was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket as Athena. But the Lunar Trailblazer satellite dropped out of contact with Earth shortly after launch and has not been heard from since.",
      "Blue Ghost and Athena were both funded in large part by NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. The CLPS initiative is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface later this decade.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-techs-big-bet-on-nuclear-power-to-fuel-artificial-intelligence/",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:47:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Faced with the need to cut carbon emissions, and an increasing energy demand to power AI, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon are investing in nuclear, from restarting Three Mile Island, to creating \"small modular reactors.\"",
    "story": [
      "It might have seemed like one of the weirder headlines of 2024: Microsoft is paying $1.6 billion to restart Three Mile Island. That's the nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania whose reactor #2 had a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries, and nobody died, but it set the nuclear industry back years. Only two new plants have been started since that accident.",
      "\"This is hallowed ground in the nuclear industry,\" said Joe Dominguez, the CEO of Constellation Energy, which owns about half of America's 54 nuclear plants (including Three Mile Island). \"This is a place where we learned and got better.\"",
      "He says that, as a result of the 1979 accident, there have been thousands of changes in protocols and procedures regarding nuclear power. \"The thing that people forget is that there was another reactor at the site,\" he said. \"That site, that reactor, continued to operate until 2019, when it was closed for economic reasons. Cheap natural gas, low demand, subsidization of different technologies in the business, [and] no policy supporting nuclear caused plants to start retiring.\"",
      "So, what is Microsoft's interest?",
      "All  of the Big Tech companies have ambitious goals to fight the climate  crisis. That includes Google and Microsoft, which have each  pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions. They were making progress, too; each has invested billions in wind and solar energy.",
      "And then, then artificial intelligence came along. AI data centers require huge amounts of electricity. \u00a0Big Tech realized that they wouldn't make their emissions goals without taking power into their own hands.",
      "Dominguez said, \"Microsoft is going to enjoy the benefit of the reliable, clean energy for 20 years.\"",
      "He says reopening the existing Three Mile Island facility would be quicker and less expensive than constructing a brand-new nuclear plant. \"At least 10 times cheaper than building a new plant,\" he said. \"And we think we could get it going in about three years, versus the last plant that was built, [which] took almost 10 years.\"",
      "But if you're a tech company, what do you do if you don't have a recently-retired nuclear plant handy? You develop new ones. Only weeks after Microsoft's announcement, both Amazon and Google announced major investments in nuclear power.",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google turns to nuclear energy for AI electricity demand",
      "Google is supplementing its already enormous green energy investments with a new kind of nuclear, called small modular reactors. \"These are not the nuclear power plants of yesterday, with the very large cooling towers,\" said Michael Terrell, who heads Google's decarbonization efforts. \"These are much smaller facilities. But because they're modular, you can stack them together to make bigger power plants.",
      "He anticipates the first advanced nuclear reactor will be online by 2030. \"And we're not going to do just one reactor, but we hope to buy from what will be a series of reactors that follow that,\" Terrell said.",
      "Nuclear power still isn't perfect; it still produces waste that has to be safely stored. But unlike solar and wind, nuclear power is always on, which is essential to those AI data centers.",
      "So, Google is funding a company called Kairos Power to design and build this new generation of reactors. Kairos is building three small demonstration plants in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the very spot where uranium was processed for the first atomic bomb.",
      "CEO Mike Laufer says that his reactors don't use fuel rods; they use fuel pebbles, about the size of golf balls \u2013 mostly graphite, with tiny kernels of uranium. And each pebble has as much power capacity as four tons of coal.",
      "And how much carbon dioxide emissions, compared to coal? \"Zero,\" Laufer said.",
      "The Kairos reactors also run at lower power and lower pressure than traditional reactors, which means lower risk.",
      "Well, this all sounds great! But what's the catch?",
      "\"There's only one problem with small modular reactors: They don't really exist,\" said George Washington University professor Sharon Squassoni, who spent 15 years researching nuclear safety for the government. She thinks Big Tech companies might be in over their heads. \"I think they're going to find out pretty quickly that it takes way too long and it's way too expensive,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see just how strong their commitments are to clean energy futures.\"",
      "\"So, you're saying they may have to turn to burning stuff [for power]?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure they will,\" Squassoni replied.",
      "\"Do you think there's a little bit of tech-bro overconfidence therein?\"",
      "\"Oh, completely, completely!\" she laughed.",
      "Kairos' Mike Laufer admitted, \"Yes, it's really hard. I will totally agree with anyone. But we're doing it at smaller scale to start, and then building on that in the future.\"",
      "Joe Dominguez's team is getting Three Mile Island ready for Microsoft, including renaming the plant the Crane Clean Energy Center. And if AI is igniting a renaissance in American nuclear, he says: full steam ahead.",
      "I asked, \"Why do all new plants take so much longer and cost so much more than projected?\"",
      "\"Honest answer? We don't build enough of them,\" Dominguez said. \"You don't want to build a unique design; you want to do kind of a cookie-cutter, one-after-another design.\"",
      "\"Is it well understood in government and the industry that if you start doing the same design over and over, we can get there faster and cheaper?\"",
      "\"It's probably the best understood idea,\" Dominguez said. \"It's understood by both Republicans and Democrats, which is a hard thing to say about anything! Everybody understands that if you build a common design, you build a bunch of them.\"",
      "\"So, you think we'll get there?\"",
      "\"I do.\"",
      "Google's Michael Terrell agrees, and believes his company will make its zero-carbon goal by 2030. \"It is an incredibly ambitious goal: 24/7 carbon-free energy everywhere we operate every way around the world,\" he said. \"But it's something we're working very hard to achieve, and we hope to get there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans on Wednesday that they do not have the votes to approve a House-passed stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with a fast-approaching Friday deadline to avert a government shutdown.",
      "\"Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. But Republicans chose a  partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input, any input, from congressional Democrats,\" Schumer said, while pushing for a vote on a shorter-term funding measure following a lengthy lunch meeting with his caucus to determine the path forward.",
      "House Republicans\u00a0approved the six-month funding measure\u00a0with the support of just one Democrat on Tuesday. The bill, known as a\u00a0continuing resolution, increases defense spending and funding for veterans' health care, while decreasing non-defense spending below 2024 levels. It also includes more funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "With the House passage, the measure is now in the hands of the Senate, where Republicans, with a 53-seat majority, need support from Democrats to reach a 60-vote threshold to propel the measure to passage.",
      "Funding the government is usually a bipartisan effort. But Democrats widely oppose the measure, warning that it would give the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency even more latitude to carry out cost-slashing efforts, while expressing frustration with the spending reductions.",
      "But Democrats aren't generally inclined to let the government shut down, either. And the House opted to cancel votes Wednesday and leave town, in hopes of preventing the Senate from changing the continuing resolution or passing a different version before Friday's deadline.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has also pledged to oppose the House-passed measure, making support from at least eight Democrats necessary to pass the measure and send it to the president's desk. That Democratic support could come from senators who represent states that President Trump won in November, who face added pressure to work across party lines.",
      "After their lunch meeting Wednesday, Senate Democrats said they want to see a vote on a shorter-term funding measure that would give appropriators more time to flesh out new spending bills. On Monday, the top Democratic appropriators, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, introduced a continuing resolution that would fund the government through April 11.",
      "\"I think people want to see a vote on the 30-day CR to let the process finish,\" Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said after the meeting. \"I think there's still a chance, I believe, to get something done.\"",
      "Schumer then took to the Senate floor to outline that Democrats are \"unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" saying \"we should vote on that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats have limited leverage in the funding fight, and the move to deny votes may be a face-saving measure. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed opposition to the short-term continuing resolution Tuesday, saying it continues to \"punt the problem down the road.\"",
      "\"At this point there's really one solution on the table,\" Thune said, noting that the House-passed stopgap measure keeps the government open and addresses core issues. \"We think it represents the best solution at the moment.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson notched a major win when he kept his conference almost entirely united behind the counting resolution on Tuesday. He said at a news conference after the vote that he's hopeful Democrats will join Republicans to prevent a possible shutdown at week's end.",
      "\"I certainly hope that there are enough Democrats in the Senate who have a conscience who will do the right thing by the American people and take care of business over there,\" the speaker said.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:11:56 -0400",
    "summary": "The CDC said 69 passengers and 16 crew on board the Princess Cruises ship Coral Princess reported falling ill with norovirus during a recent voyage.",
    "story": [
      "Another norovirus outbreak sickened passengers on board the cruise ship Coral Princess in February, marking the second outbreak this year on the ocean liner operated by Princess Cruises, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Sixty-nine passengers and 16 crew members fell ill during the February outbreak, the CDC said. There were 1,906 passengers and 895 crew members on the ship overall. The outbreak happened during a 16-night voyage from Los Angeles, California, through the Panama Canal.",
      "Cases reported on the recent trip were considered \"mild,\" a spokesperson for Princess Cruises told CBS News in an email.",
      "\"At the earliest signs of illness, we promptly enacted enhanced sanitization protocols, including comprehensive disinfection, isolating affected guests, and offering health guidance to everyone on board,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It was unclear whether those who reported developing symptoms on the ship became sick at the same time, or at different points along their journey. The Coral Princess left Los Angeles on Feb. 21 and returned March 9 to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, according to the CDC. After arriving in Fort Lauderdale, crew members disinfected the ship prior to its next voyage, the spokesperson said.",
      "Princess Cruises told the CDC that crew members took additional steps to minimize the spread of norovirus once it was detected on the Coral Princess, including testing people with norovirus symptoms, the agency said. Their response to the outbreak was guided by the CDC's vessel sanitation program, which monitored the situation remotely. The program is a resource for cruise companies to prevent and manage public health problems on ships.",
      "Norovirus, also known as a stomach bug, is a highly infectious disease that typically causes symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Symptoms usually last between one and three days, but a person can still transmit the notoriously contagious virus to others for two weeks or longer after their symptoms subside, the CDC said on its website.",
      "Outbreaks of norovirus are often seen on cruise ships, in congregate living situations like jails and nursing homes, and in other places like schools where groups are gathered close together. As cases of the illness surged around the U.S. toward the end of last year, the CDC reported hundreds of cruise passengers caught the virus on three different ships in December alone. One of those outbreaks happened on a Princess Cruises ship, the Ruby Princess, as it sailed around Hawaii. The other two affected Holland America's Rotterdam and Zuiderdam on voyages through the Caribbean.",
      "The CDC said more norovirus outbreaks spread on cruise ships in December 2024 than any other month last year. In total, the agency tracked 14 norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships in 2024, several of which occurred on trips run by Princess Cruises. In December, about 100 passengers and 12 crew reported being ill during the Ruby Princess outbreak, after an outbreak on the Coral Princess in November where\u00a055 passengers and 15 crew\u00a0came down with the virus.",
      "Princess Cruises' latest outbreak is the second since the start of 2025 on the Coral Princess. In January, another voyage on the same ship saw 128 passengers and 20 crew on board develop the virus, the CDC said.",

    "summary": "Robert Davis was the last person to see his girlfriend Barbara Lenz alive before she vanished in 1989, Iowa investigators said.",
    "story": [
      "The former boyfriend of an Iowa woman who vanished 36 years ago has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder in her disappearance, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Robert Davis, who is now 61 and lives in Council Bluffs, Iowa, was arrested Monday in the case of Barbara Lenz, 31, who was last seen on May 6, 1989, the Iowa Department of Justice said in a news release. Davis, who was Lenz' boyfriend at the time, reported dropping her off at her apartment in Woodbine, Iowa, that day. Lenz was then expected to visit her former boyfriend and the father of her 3-year-old child in Omaha, Nebraska, but she didn't show up, according to the release.",
      "Lenz's family contacted the Woodbine Police Department on May 17. Police and family members entered Lenz's apartment and found her pets had not been cared for \"in some time,\" according to a criminal complaint. Her personal effects, including her purse and wallet, were in the home. There were no signs of a struggle.",
      "Police determined that Davis was the last person to have seen Lenz alive, according to the complaint. He told investigators Lenz had called him from Omaha to say she was with her daughter, but police determined she never arrived there.",
      "During the course of the investigation, police found that Lenz had told several people she feared Davis, the complaint said. Shortly before her disappearance, Lenz told at least two people that Davis said he would kill her if she left him, according to the complaint.",
      "Lenz was also allegedly assaulted by Davis \"on several known occasions\" during their two-year relationship, according to the complaint, including incidents during which she was allegedly strangled until she fell unconscious. There was also an incident where Davis allegedly hit Lenz's daughter at a restaurant in front of Lenz and other witnesses. Davis admitted these incidents to police, the complaint said.",
      "Davis told police he did not like Lenz going to Nebraska to see her daughter and ex-boyfriend, the complaint said, and several fights and assaults by Davis allegedly followed her visits. Davis said they had argued before her May 6 visit, according to the complaint. There were witnesses to the argument. One witness said Davis injured Lenz by slashing her across the cheek with a sharp object. Another witness reported seeing Lenz and Davis leaving the apartment complex together.",
      "One witness told investigators that Davis' brother showed them a spot in a rural area where he and Davis had buried something wrapped in plastic. The complaint did not say if the area was excavated or what was wrapped in the plastic.",
      "Other witnesses told investigators that Davis told them they would \"end up like Barbara\" after arguments. The statements were made long after Lenz's disappearance, the complaint said.",
      "Lenz's body has never been found. Investigators \"pursued numerous leads and searches\" over the years, to no avail, the Iowa Department of Justice said. In July 2024, the Attorney General's office launched an Iowa Cold Case Unit to investigate unsolved crimes. The unit investigated Lenz's case and \"brought fresh eyes and a focused team to dig through information, meet with witnesses, and loosen up leads.\"",
      "That led investigators to Davis. The complaint alleges that because of Davis' behavior and history with Lenz, investigators believe he murdered Lenz \"with malice aforethought, wilfully, deliberately, and with premeditation.\"",
      "An attorney was not listed for Davis.",
      "\"Something I have waited for my whole life\"",
      "The case will be prosecuted in Harrison County, the Iowa Department of Justice said. Davis is being held without bond in the Harrison County Jail,\u00a0CBS News affiliate KCCI reported.",
      "Lenz's daughter, Lindsy Baumgart, told KCCI that Davis' arrest is \"surreal\" and that she is \"grateful\" for the investigation.",
      "\"I never thought this day would come,\" she told KCCI. \"It's honestly something that I have waited for my whole life.\"",

      "The full moon reaches peak illumination at 2:55 a.m. ET on Friday, March 14. The total lunar eclipse will make the moon appear red on Thursday, March 13 into the following day, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "When and where to see the \"Blood Worm Moon\"",
      "While this month's full moon will rise early Friday, it will appear full from around Wednesday evening into Saturday morning, according to NASA. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday night at 11:57 p.m. EDT. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",
      "The moon will exit from Earth's full shadow between 3:31 a.m. and 4:48 a.m., and will leave the last of the partial shadow at 6 a.m. ending lunar eclipse.",
      "Viewers in North and South America will catch the best views of the \"Blood Worm Moon,\" though parts of Europe and Africa may catch a glimpse.",
      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "This month's full moon is also called the Worm Moon. The nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",

      "The move means the Environmental Justice Divisions within 10 EPA regional offices will be reorganized and eliminated. EPA headquarters already closed its\u00a0Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights in D.C. and placed 168 employees on administrative leave, although it did reinstate a handful of those people.",
      "In the memo, dated Tuesday, March 11, Zeldin said this action is in response to President Trump's executive order on \"ending radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferences,\" as well as two other executive actions.",
      "The EPA confirmed the closures at regional offices.",
      "\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people,\" Zeldin said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs.\"",

      "It's not yet clear exactly how many people will lose their jobs with the EPA as a result of the closures. Exact staffing levels across the country are unknown, but sources tell CBS News there were roughly 200 total people employed at environmental justice offices in DC and the 10 regional locations.

Many have lived in the shadows for decades, waiting for a pathway to citizenship that may never come. And with a new president that has vowed to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, anxieties have been heightened.",
      "\"It's definitely a concern, definitely a worry,\" Mary, an undocumented Irish immigrant in New England, told CBS News. \"I've heard of different people, you know, getting caught up in a swoop of undocumented people \u2014 some of them may be criminals, but some of them may not be, and it's just a situation of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"",

      "\"When Irish people come here, they come on what we call the visa waiver program, so that allows them to come to the United States without going to the consulate in Dublin, and they can come in for 90 days and stay for 90 days, and so most of them [who are undocumented] overstay,\" John Foley, a Boston-based immigration attorney told CBS News.",
      "\"The waiver part means they waive all rights to judicial processing, meaning they can be removed or deported from the United States without going in front of a judge,\" Foley said. \"If you're an ICE officer and you need to get 40 people a week, it's Thursday and you're at 27, you don't care where the last 13 come from.\"",

    "summary": "Consumers, businesses and investors are increasingly jittery about the risks of a protracted slump. So what exactly is a recession?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sparked concerns this week when he declined to rule out the possibility of a U.S. recession this year. Asked on Fox news if he expects such a slump, Mr. Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.\"",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also seemed to leave open the possibility of a downturn, telling CBS News in an interview on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's economic policies are \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.",
      "While it is notoriously hard to predict a recession, there are definitive criteria that must be met in order for a business cycle to be considered recessionary. Here's what to know.",
      "What is a recession, and who decides if we're in one?",
      "A recession is generally defined as a broad-based, persistent decline in economic activity. The more popular metric is that a recession is two straight quarters of negative economic growth, although in fact there's more to it than.",
      "Recessions are identified by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a non-profit, nonpartisan research group that dates U.S. business cycles. To determine if the economy has entered a recession, NBER evaluates six key indicators: real personal income; non-farm payroll employment; employment as measured by the household survey; personal consumption; manufacturing and trade sales; and industrial production.",
      "More specifically, NBER looks at the depth of the changes in these indicators, how broadly a slump is affecting different industries and how long a downturn lasts. The upshot: In a recession, the decline in economic activity must be significant, sustained and widespread, rather than limited to a particular sector.",
      "Could the U.S. tumble into a recession anytime soon?",
      "For now, economic data suggest that's unlikely. Although layoffs around the country are rising, the U.S. labor market continues to create jobs at a decent clip. Despite economic growth slowing, it's not expected to fall off a cliff. In fact, Julia Pollack, chief economist at career site ZipRecruiter, notes that four of the six signals tracked by the NBER point to continued economic expansion.",
      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Still, cracks are appearing that could portend a sharper downturn down the road. Retail spending, which is the lifeblood of the economy, is\u00a0waning, while measures of consumer confidence show a\u00a0sharp deterioration of late. Investor concerns about the Trump administration's barrage of tariffs on other nations has also slammed stock prices, which could further pressure spending.",
      "\"Negative consumption is concerning because consumer spending is backbone of U.S. economy,\" Pollack said. \"And it's not just that spending fell. Sentiment has fallen, household budgets are squeezed and consumers are more vulnerable to shocks, which has heightened recession fears.\"",
      "Sweet added, \"Right now, your traditional causes of a recession aren't flashing red, but we just have this suffocating effect of all the uncertainty around trade and fiscal policy and immigration.\"",
      "Lutnick, the Commerce Department chief, defends Mr. Trump's economic policies, saying they will boost economic activity.",
      "\"The only reason there could possibly be a recession is because the Biden nonsense that we had to live with. These policies produce revenues. They produce growth. They produce factories being built here,\" he told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "What signals would point to a recession?",
      "The clearest sign would be a steady increase in job losses and a jump unemployment. In a recession, consumers pare spending and businesses pull back on investment. That typically leads to a slowdown in hiring and rise in layoffs.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate did tick up last month, to 4.1% from 4%, though that is still quite low. But employers added 151,000 jobs, a sign that businesses are still seeking to hire workers and enough payroll gains to keep unemployment in check.",
      "Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly jobless claims\u00a0remain low.",
      "Who is most vulnerable in a recession?",
      "Most Americans would feel the impact of a recession in one way or another, for weaker hiring to tepid wage gains. Among people who are employed, those who entered the labor market last tend to be the first to lose their job in a recession, noted Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a left-leaning economic think tank.",
      "\"So you see the people who are hardest to reach as we reach full employment are the first to get laid off. That includes lower wage workers, black workers, Latino workers. Those who have the hardest time getting a job when times are good are first to lose jobs when times are bad,\" he said.",
      "Americans who carry debt on their homes and can't make minimum payments also can face foreclosure in a downturn, locking a generation out of building household wealth.",
      "\"That's one reason why recessions are so damaging, because it's the least among us that get hurt the most when downturns come,\" Jacquez said.",

    "story": [
      "A Pennsylvania man was caught trying to carry a live turtle through airport security by hiding the reptile in his pants, the Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday.",
      "The man, who has not been identified, was flagged last week when he went through a body scanner at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, the security agency said in a news release.",
      "A TSA officer conducted a pat-down of the man's groin area and determined there was something hidden there. When asked if he was hiding something, the man reached down the front of his pants and pulled out a live turtle, the TSA said. The reptile was wrapped in a small blue towel. Officials estimated the turtle to be about five inches long.",
      "The man allegedly told officials the reptile was a red-ear slider turtle.",
      "This type of turtle is native to the Mississippi River area, according to the\u00a0National Invasive Species Information Center. It is a popular pet but is one of the most invasive species in the world because owners often release them into the wild, according to the the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium. The turtles can live between 20 and 30 years, and are named for a distinctive reddish stripe behind each eye. Red-ear slider turtles can weigh up to two pounds and range in length from five to 11 inches. The species is not endangered.",
      "Port Authority Police questioned the man and took possession of the turtle. They indicated they would contact the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and local animal control officials, the TSA said. Thomas Carter, the TSA's Federal Security Director for New Jersey, said that \"as best as we could tell, the turtle was not harmed by the man's actions.",
      "The man missed his flight and was escorted from the checkpoint by police, the TSA said. The agency did not say if he would face charges.",
      "Carter said he believed this was the first time a case like this had occurred.",
      "\"We have seen travelers try to conceal knives and other weapons on their person, in their shoes and in their luggage, however I believe this is the first time we have come across someone who was concealing a live animal down the front of his pants,\" Carter said.",
      "In 2024, the TSA stopped a traveler from bringing a bag of snakes on board a plane, CBS News reported. In 2023, Miami airport officials confiscated a bag of smuggled Amazon parrot eggs and live birds after they heard chirping coming from a duffel bag.",

    "story": [
      "Trading in U.S. stocks mostly rebounded Wednesday after a government report showed that U.S. inflation slowed more than expected in February.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,611 in early trading, a day after it briefly fell more than 10% below its all-time high set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 132 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.",
      "Inflation in February rose 2.8% from a year ago, slightly lower than economists had forecast, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "\"Today's inflation report brings some much needed relief for equity markets, averting immediate concerns around stagflation and giving the Fed space to cut policy rates in the coming months if economic data continue to deteriorate,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an analyst note.",
      "Markets have whipsawed in recent weeks, with investors spooked by the Trump administration's protectionist trade policies. In the latest salvo, President Trump on Wednesday increased tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25%, prompting immediate threats of retaliation by the European Union and Canada.",
      "\"Trump's tariff policies continue to have a destabilizing effect on markets, with investors left guessing as to which measures will either be added or walked back next,\" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.",
      "The recent market swings followed more warning signals about the economy as Mr. Trump's on-and-off-again rollout of tariffs creates confusion among U.S. households and businesses.",
      "Such tariffs can hurt the economy directly by raising prices for U.S. consumers and gumming up global trade. But even if they end up being milder than feared, all the whipsaw moves could leave U.S. companies and consumers unwilling to invest or spend, and looking to the Fed for a clearer economic outlook.",
      "\"As we entered 2025, investors' main economic worry centered around reflation,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in a research note. \"But as the trade war continues to escalate and as economic policy uncertainty continues to rise, that worry has shifted from inflation to the labor market and the economy as a whole. In that respect, it will take more than a few reassuring inflation reports to ease investors' worries.\"",

    "story": [
      "Inflation in February rose 2.8% on an annual basis, slightly lower than economists had forecast but continuing to signal that price hikes remain elevated despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "February's data comes after inflation accelerated in January, when it rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The report shows \"further signs of progress on underlying inflation, with the pace of price increases moderating after January's strong release,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Despite the lower-than-expected inflation, the Federal Reserve is still likely to hold off on cutting rates at its March 19 meeting, Haigh noted. \"[The] combination of easing inflationary pressures and rising downside risks to growth suggest that the Fed is moving closer to continuing its easing cycle,\" Haigh said.",
      "Grocery prices are continuing to rise, with groceries increasing 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the CPI report said. The ongoing rise of food costs is creating a financial pinch for many households, economists note.",
      "Egg prices were a driver of last month's grocery inflation, with the cost of eggs jumping 58.8% from a year earlier, the report said. Coffee rose 6% on an annual basis, while restaurant meals jumped 3.7% from a year ago.",
      "Food inflation has been \"gradually accelerating since mid-2024, reaching almost 5% on a 3-month annualized basis\" in January, according to Morgan Stanley economists in a March 6 research note.",
      "Other items that saw price hikes in February include car insurance, which rose 11.1% on an annual basis, and medical care, which rose 3% from a year ago. Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff barrage has the potential to boost prices for many products, from food imports to automobiles, adding to an uncertain outlook for inflation, economists say.",
      "\"Good news on inflation, but good news pre-tariffs,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Unfortunately, three main pain points for consumer budgets \u2014 shelter, medical care and car insurance \u2014 had substantial increases.\"",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Even though the inflation data came in lighter than expected, price increases are still pacing well above the Fed's 2% annual goal. Because of that, economists say it's unlikely the Fed will cut rates at its meeting next week.",
      "That means consumers and businesses will continue to face higher borrowing costs for longer, while still grappling with elevated price hikes, economists say.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve will remain firmly planted on the sidelines at next week's meeting,\" Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said on Wednesday. \"Inflation readings still need to show sustained progress toward 2%, and the recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"",

    "story": [
      "As universities around the country race to assess new federal policies geared toward ending programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, one college administrator is in a potentially tricky position.",
      "Lakshmi Chilukuri is the provost of the University of California San Diego's Sixth College. She is also Vice President JD Vance's mother-in-law. Chilukuri helped create a pilot course on race, ethnicity and gender in biology and medicine, served on the university's biological sciences diversity committee, and has written proudly of her school's commitment to diversity.",
      "The university features its diversity efforts prominently on its website and a letter from Chilukuri to incoming students emphasizes the school's \"steadfast adherence to principles that drive equity, inclusion, and an embrace of diversity.\"",
      "\"As we come into the new academic year with the pandemic not quite yet in the rearview mirror, with issues of equity and systemic racism, anti-Blackness and anti-Asian racism yet unresolved, we have before us both opportunity and responsibility,\" Chilukuri wrote in the undated letter. The Internet Archive shows the letter was first posted in late 2021, with minor edits made over the next year. It has since remained as the main body of text on the Sixth College's \"About\" page.",
      "A crackdown on what President Trump and Vance call \"wokeness\" has been a hallmark of their administration's first weeks. Widespread scalebacks of DEI programs in academia, government and across corporations have marked some of the administration's earliest marquee victories.",
      "Vance said in a statement, \"I don't like DEI, and I'm proud of what our administration has done on that front.\"",
      "\"But I love my mother-in-law. If she doesn't share my views on DEI I suppose I'll have to do what 99 percent of Americans do when confronted with a family member who doesn't always agree with them: get over it,\" Vance said. \"I'll choose instead to focus on her kindness and the fact that she's an incredible mother and loving grandmother to the most important people in my life.\"",
      "Vance added, \"This story exists because CBS has decided that harassing my mother in law is a reasonable price in order to attack President Trump.\" Chilukuri did not reply to emailed questions. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment.",
      "The Trump administration has attacked DEI on college campuses with particular zeal, threatening investigations, lawsuits and canceled federal funding. A Feb. 14 \"Dear Colleague\" letter from the Department of Education to schools across the country warned that they risked federal funding if they continued to take race into account when making scholarship or hiring decisions, or include race as a policy factor in any \"other aspects of student, academic and campus life.\"",
      "The administration's anti-DEI campaign led a U.S. attorney to warn the Georgetown Law School that its students wouldn't be considered for jobs at his office unless the school renounced its DEI programs. Mr. Trump's alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has removed from its websites most references to diversity and inclusion, and on March 7, the University of Virginia's governing board voted to dissolve its office of diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "Many corporations have followed suit, including CBS News' parent company Paramount, which in late February ceased using hiring goals related to race, ethnicity, sex or gender, among other policy changes related to DEI.",
      "Vance has been vocal about combatting DEI, speaking about it frequently since his earliest days in politics. In a 2021 speech, Vance, quoting Richard Nixon, said professors are \"the enemy,\" and called on Americans to \"aggressively attack the universities in this country,\" saying \"they care more about diversity, equity and inclusion than they do their own society.\" That view is shared by the president, and the White House has backed it up, issuing executive orders that threaten to withhold federal funding from institutions operating what it calls \"illegal\" DEI programs. It has not clarified exactly what that means.",
      "The president also ordered federal agencies to identify colleges with endowments over $1 billion that might be susceptible to investigation or lawsuits due to their DEI policies. UCSD's endowment is more than $1.4 billion, according to the UC San Diego Foundation's website. Last fiscal year, UCSD received more than $500 million in federal funds for research.",
      "Vance married Chilukuri's daughter Usha in 2014, and the couple have three young children. Vance said in a 2020 podcast interview that Chilukuri took a yearlong sabbatical from her work as a professor to help care for one of her grandchildren. He described Chilukuri and her husband \u2014 also a professor \u2014 as classic, doting grandparents.",
      "\"You can sort of see the effect it has on him to be around them, like they spoil him and sort of all the classic stuff that grandparents do to grandchildren,\" Vance said. \"But it makes him a much better human being to have exposure to his grandparents, and the evidence on this, by the way, is like super clear.\"",
      "Chilukuri has worked at UCSD for decades, rising through the ranks to become provost in 2018.",
      "\"Professor Chilukuri has a demonstrated record of commitment to undergraduate education, equity, and diversity,\" wrote the university's chancellor and executive vice chancellor in an announcement of her promotion to provost. They called Chilukuri \"a creative and dynamic educator.\"",
      "The popular professor, who also goes by \"Provost Chill\" and \"Dr. C,\" championed DEI initiatives at the school. A 2019 article on the UCSD website examined BILD 60, a class that the school's 2024-2025 catalog lists as satisfying students' DEI course requirement.",
      "The course, called \"Exploring Issues of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Relation to Human Biology,\" was developed because members of the school's Division of Biological Sciences' Diversity Committee, including Chilukuri, \"recognized the need for a course that looked at DEI issues through a scientific lens,\" according to the article.",
      "Her commitment to inclusiveness was apparent long before she was a provost. Former student Kjeld Aamodt recalled fondly taking a freshman year lecture taught by Chilukuri nearly two decades ago.",
      "\"It was a huge class. It was probably 500 people in that class, but I remember feeling like she recognized me and made me feel special, and had a genuine interest in me,\" Aamodt said in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Aamodt, now an orthodontist, said Chilukuri was one of just a few professors to leave a lasting impact on him \u2014 repeating, \"verbatim\" he said, some of her teachings to his own children.",
      "\"I remember her being fairly consistent about [diversity and inclusion], even then we were a very diverse student population, a lot of different ethnicities, and all under one roof and one big auditorium, you know, 500 strong,\" Aamodt said. \"And I remember feeling welcomed and observing her being able to connect with people from very different backgrounds, and I got that feeling that she was practicing what she preached.\"",
      "That commitment to diversity is clear in Chilukuri's letter to incoming students. She wrote of the \"opportunity and responsibility\" to address systemic racism:",
      "\"How we embrace both will greatly influence who we are as a college and a community. Whether through our African Black Diaspora Living Learning Community, our Multi-Cultural Living Learning Community, programming through our Student Affairs, Residence Life, Academic Advising, Student Council, Student Organizations, or our Culture Art and Technology core academic program, I invite each of you to be part of the conversation and part of the solution.\"",

    "story": [
      "NASA is finally ready to launch its next space station crew, clearing the way for Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams to head back to Earth more than nine months after they took off on what they thought would be an eight-day stay in space.",
      "Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov are scheduled for launch from historic pad 39 at the Kennedy Space Center at 7:48 p.m. EDT Wednesday. If all goes well, they will catch up with the space station Thursday, moving in for docking at the lab's forward port at 6 a.m.",
      "Standing by to welcome them aboard will be Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams, along with cosmonauts Alexsey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Don Pettit, who were launched last September aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "McClain and her crewmates will spend two days getting briefed by Crew 9 on the intricacies of space station operations before Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams undock on March 16 for return to Earth. The normal \"handover\" period is five days or so, but mission managers shortened it this time around to maintain the lab's food reserves.",
      "While the ongoing saga of the \"stranded\" Starliner astronauts has overshadowed the Crew 10 mission, McClain said she and her crewmates began training for their mission in 2023 and they were all eager to finally get into space. McClain and Onishi are space station veterans while Ayers and Peskov are making their first flight.",
      "All four are veteran military or commercial pilots. Before joining NASA, McClain, an active-duty Army colonel, served as a combat helicopter pilot while Ayers, an Air Force major, is a veteran F-22 Raptor pilot. Onishi served as a commercial pilot in Japan, flying Boeing 767 jetliners, and Peskov is an experienced commercial 757 pilot.",
      "\"We're going to have planned and unplanned maintenance to keep the space station running,\" McClain said. \"We have a plethora of science experiments, both inside and outside of the space station. We have spacewalks. We have visiting vehicles (and) the potential of (hosting) private astronaut missions.\"",
      "\"They're ready to come home\"",
      "As for Wilmore and Williams, McClain said, \"honestly, I'm kind of most looking forward to breaking bread with those guys, talking to them, giving them big hugs. We go way back. ... We're ready to go up there. They're ready to come home.\"",
      "\"This is a huge mission for us on Crew 10,\" said Steve Stich, manager of the commercial crew program that oversees SpaceX Crew Dragons and Boeing's Starliner. \"They're all big, but this started all the way back to Crew 9 when we launched that mission with two empty seats, and we had those seats reserved for Butch and Suni.\"",
      "The Starliner astronauts have \"just done a phenomenal job,\" Stich said, \"and so we're excited to bring them back.\"",
      "Given an on-time launch for Crew 10, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams could undock on March 16 and land as early as March 17. If so, the Starliner astronauts will have logged 285 days \u2014 9.5 months \u2014 in space on a flight originally expected to last a little longer than one week. Hague and Gorbunov's time in space will come to 170 days.",
      "The U.S. record for longest single spaceflight is held by astronaut Frank Rubio, who spent 371 days in space because of problems with the Soyuz spacecraft that carried him to orbit. Like the Starliner crew, he was forced to extend his mission and come home on a different Soyuz.",
      "In any case, what would normally be a relatively routine crew rotation, sending up four crew members to replace four others wrapping up a five- to six-month station visit, has turned into political theater, fueled by repeated criticism from President Trump and Elon Musk blaming the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's predicament.",
      "Musk said in a post on his social media platform X that he offered to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams earlier, but the offer was turned down. He did not say who turned the proposal down or even whether it was someone at NASA or the White House.",
      "\"Biden left them up there,\" Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on March 6. \"We have two astronauts that are stuck in space. I have asked Elon, I said, do me a favor, can you get 'em out? He said yes. He is preparing to go up I think in two weeks.\"",
      "But the Crew Dragon he was referring to will not be bringing Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. It will be carrying the Crew 10 fliers and will remain docked at the outpost for the next five months. Their arrival does, however, clear the way for Crew 9, including Wilmore and Williams, to finally return to Earth aboard their own Crew Dragon.",
      "That Crew Dragon, which carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September for a normal tour of duty, has been docked at the lab ever since. It was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams so their ride home has been at the station for the past five-and-a-half months.",
      "NASA could have brought Crew 9 down earlier, but that would have left a single astronaut, Pettit, aboard the lab to operate and maintain the U.S. segment of the space station. Research would have ground to a halt and he would have had difficulty in a variety of emergency scenarios.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams told CBS News in an in-flight interview. \"And, you know, the space station is big. It's a building, you know, it's the size of a football field. Things happen.",
      "\"So things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside and outside. And so having additional people to be able to do that is really important.\"",
      "\"We don't feel stranded\"",
      "Both Wilmore and Williams have repeatedly said they are not \"stranded\" and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "\"That's been the narrative from day one, stranded, abandoned, stuck, and I get it, we both get it,\" Wilmore told a reporter during a recent interview. \"But that is, again, not what our human space flight program is about. We don't feel abandoned, we don't feel stuck, we don't feel stranded.",
      "\"We come prepared. We come committed. That is what your human space flight program is. It prepares for any and all contingencies that we can conceive of, and we prepare for those. ... Let's change (the narrative) to 'prepared' and 'committed.'\"",
      "And so, NASA's plan to bring the Starliner astronauts home, a plan managers said minimized disruption to the space station crew rotation schedule, has been in place since last August. Even so, the president has repeatedly blamed the Biden administration for the extended mission.",
      "NASA managers have not openly challenged the president's comments and have generally downplayed their responses to questions about Musk's claim to have offered to launch another Crew Dragon to bring Wilmore and Williams home.",
      "Last August, Stich was asked about the possibility of launching a mission specifically to bring the Starliner crew back to Earth. He told reporters during a news conference that the agency \"really never considered that option.\"",
      "\"From the very beginning, we liked the option of modifying Crew 9 or Crew 8,\" he said, referring to the option of adding Williams and Wilmore to Hague's crew or whether to shoehorn them into a Crew Dragon that brought four other station fliers back to Earth last October.",
      "\"We looked at both of those and bringing them back on either one of those vehicles,\" Stich said at the time. \"We're trying to lay out the rest of our manifest to make sure we have vehicles available for all the flights. It just didn't make sense to go ahead and accelerate a flight to return Butch and Suni earlier.\"",
      "What went wrong with Boeing's Starliner?",
      "Wilmore and Williams were launched aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule last June 5 for the spacecraft's first piloted test flight. They successfully docked with the International Space Station the next day, but the Starliner experienced multiple helium propulsion system leaks and several maneuvering jets that did not produce the expected thrust.",
      "NASA carried out weeks of tests and analysis to determine whether the Starliner could be trusted to safely bring its crew back to Earth.",
      "By August, Boeing managers were convinced engineers understood the problems and the crew could safely come home in the Starliner. But NASA managers disagreed and ruled that option out. Instead, as Stich described, they decided to keep the astronauts aboard the station until early this year\u00a0when they could hitch a ride back aboard the Crew 9 Dragon.",
      "The Starliner astronauts took the news of a lengthy mission extension in stride.",
      "\"Butch, and I knew this was a test flight, we knew that we would probably find some things (that did not work as expected), and we found some stuff,\" Williams told CBS News. \"And so that was not a surprise. The discussion went over the summer, and as things started unrolling, unraveling, we sort of understood that, hey, we might be up here a little bit longer.",
      "\"And that's what our job is. We have both been in the military, both Navy guys, our deployments have been extended. You do what's right for the team, and what was right for the team is to stay up here and be expedition crew members for the International Space Station.\"",
      "Last September, Boeing successfully brought the Starliner down by remote control and NASA launched the Crew 9 mission aboard a Crew Dragon carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, along with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Starliner astronauts joined the Crew 9 expedition and originally expected to return to Earth in February after arrival of the next Crew Dragon in the crew rotation sequence. But the Crew 10 Dragon, a new vehicle making its first flight, ran into problems that delayed launch, and Crew 9's return, to the end of March.",
      "NASA eventually decided to switch Crew 10 to a different Dragon, enabling a launch on March 12, a few weeks earlier than the previous late March target. Stich said the capsule swap and slightly earlier launch date were not the result of any outside pressure.",
      "The decision \"really was driven by a lot of other factors,\" Stich said. \"We were looking at this before some of those statements were made by the President and Mr. Musk.\"",
      "Said Ken Bowersox, NASA's chief of spaceflight operations at agency Headquarters: \"I can verify that Steve had been talking about how we might need to juggle the flights and switch capsules a good month before there was any discussion outside of NASA.\"",
      "\"But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who's interested in what we're doing.\"",

    "summary": "A Louisiana woman accused of getting abortion pills from a New York doctor and giving them to her daughter to end a pregnancy has pleaded not guilty to a felony.",
    "story": [
      "A Louisiana woman pleaded not guilty Tuesday after allegedly\u00a0getting abortion pills from a New York doctor and giving them to her teenage daughter to terminate a pregnancy, a felony in the southern state that has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "The woman's arraignment is part of a cross-state legal battle that involves what may be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, putting Louisiana's abortion ban in tension with New York's shield laws.",
      "In January, a West Baton Rouge grand jury unanimously issued an indictment against the 39-year-old Louisiana woman for criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, which is a felony. The woman has not been publicly identified by The Associated Press to protect the identity of the minor.",
      "The indictment in Louisiana came months after the state became the first to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 a two-drug regimen that can be used to end pregnancies through the 10th week \u2014 as \"controlled dangerous substances.\"",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective.",
      "Pills have become the most common method of abortion in the U.S. and are at the center of political and legal fights over abortion access following the overturning of Roe. Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. since state bans started taking effect.",
      "According to Baton Rouge District Attorney Tony Clayton, last year the woman requested abortion medication online from New York-based Dr. Margaret Carpenter, for her daughter. Clayton said the request was made through a questionnaire only and no consultation with the teen.",
      "A \"cocktail of pills\" was mailed to the woman who directed her daughter to take them, according to the prosecutor.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\"\u00a0 Clayton said. \"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids.\"",
      "After taking the drug, the girl experienced a medical emergency, called 911 and was transported to the hospital where she was treated. While responding to the emergency, a police officer learned about the pills and under further investigation found that an out-of-state doctor had supplied the drugs and turned their findings over to Clayton's office.",
      "The Baton Rouge jury also indicted Carpenter, who is facing the same felony charge as the Louisiana woman. The indictment triggered Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to send a formal extradition order to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "Under Louisiana law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "Landry demanded that Carpenter be turned over to Louisiana and face the state's justice system. Hochul refused, saying she would not sign the order. The New York governor at the time said she'd sent out a notice that certain out-of-state warrants are not enforceable in her state.",
      "\"Louisiana has changed their laws, but that has no bearing on the laws here in the state of New York,\" Hochul said. \"I will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana. Not now, not ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Texas State District Judge Bryan Gantt ordered Carpenter to pay a $100,000 penalty as well as attorneys fees for allegedly breaking a Texas law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine. Carpenter's case appears to be the first example of a doctor facing criminal charges for allegedly sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has tossed an Amarillo woman's death sentence after it found that local prosecutors had failed to reveal that their primary trial witness was a paid informant.",
      "With a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals last week sent Brittany Marlowe Holberg's 1998 murder conviction back down to the trial court to decide how to proceed.",
      "Holberg has been on death row for 27 years. In securing her conviction in 1998, Randall County prosecutors heavily relied on testimony from a jail inmate who was working as a confidential informant for the City of Amarillo police. That informant recanted her testimony in 2011, but neither a Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or a federal district court found that prosecutors had violated Holberg's constitutional right to a fair trial.",
      "The appeals court disagreed, saying that the informant was critical to the jury's determination of guilt and that the prosecution violated Holberg's due process rights by hiding information that, according to a landmark U.S. Supreme court ruling called the Brady doctrine, must be disclosed. Writing for the majority, judge Patrick E. Higginbotham cast Holberg's case as a blight on the criminal justice system.",
      "A federal appeals court has reversed an Amarillo woman\u2019s death sentence after it found that local prosecutors had failed to reveal that their primary trial witness was a paid informant. >>> https://t.co/w6VqpILI3K pic.twitter.com/ljsAGno3by",
      "\"We pause only to acknowledge that 27 years on death row is a reality dimming the light that ought to attend proceedings where a life is at stake, a stark reminder that the jurisprudence of capital punishment remains a work in progress,\" wrote Higginbotham, a Ronald Reagan appointee.",
      "Holberg was sentenced to death by an Amarillo jury when she was 23 years old. The jury found her guilty of murdering A.B. Towery, an 80-year-old man and former client of Holberg, a sex worker. During trial, Holberg asserted that she acted in self-defense and that she stabbed Towery because she feared for her life and sought to protect herself after he struck her on the back of the head and refused to relent.",
      "The prosecution, however, presented testimony from Holberg's jail cellmate Vickie Marie Kirkpatrick, who alleged that Holberg had admitted to killing Towery \"in order to get money\" and said she \"would do it all over again for more drugs.\"",
      "Kirkpatrick was at the time working as a confidential informant for the City of Amarillo police, a fact prosecutors did not disclose. They instead presented Kirkpatrick as a \"disinterested individual who 'wanted to do the right thing,'\" Higginbotham wrote.",
      "\"Ms. Holberg's 27 years on death row is a showcase of the State's failure to abide by a core structure of prosecution: the Brady doctrine,\" Higginbotham wrote.",
      "Holberg had experienced severe and repeated sexual abuse during her childhood and fell into a crack cocaine addiction. She turned to sex work to support her addiction, according to court documents.",
      "On Nov. 13, 1996, she had a minor traffic accident and then sought refuge in Towery's apartment. A heated argument turned violent, leaving Towery dead with part of a lamp lodged within his throat. Holberg left the apartment cut, bruised and bleeding from her head where Towery struck her.",
      "While in jail, the Randall County District Attorney's Office approached multiple inmates to question them about Holberg, offering them a deal in exchange for testimony. Kirkpatrick, who was placed in the same cell as Holberg, produced a statement detailing an alleged admission from Holberg. That same day, Kirkpatrick was released on bond.",
      "In a lone dissent, circuit judge Stuart Kyle Duncan, a Donald Trump appointee, wrote that the jury did not solely rely on Kirkpatrick's testimony to reach their decision of guilt.",
      "\"The jury was presented with graphic physical evidence that Holberg sadistically butchered a sick old man-with a lamp rammed down his throat as the coup de gr\u00e2ce,\" Duncan wrote. \"That evidence doomed Holberg's self-defense theory and there is no chance that impeaching Kirkpatrick would have resurrected it.\"",
      "Randall County District Attorney Robert Love, who was the assistant district attorney when Holberg's case was first prosecuted, said in an emailed statement that he was \"disappointed\" by the 5th Circuit's ruling. He declined to comment further on the case until the Texas Office of the Attorney General decides how to proceed. \"They are currently discussing the legal options available,\" Love said.",
      "Holberg's attorneys didn't immediately respond to The Texas Tribune's request for comment on Monday. A Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson said the agency had no comment on Holberg's case. Holberg is currently being held at the Patrick L. O'Daniel Unit, a Gatesville prison that houses females on death row, among other inmates.",
      "Texas leads the country in executions and is among the top three in imposing death sentences. The state's use of capital punishment has waned, however, and the number of people on death row has dropped by more than half over the past twenty five years. There are 174 people on Texas' death row, and seven of them are women.",
      "According to CBS affiliate KFDA-TV, Holberg is currently being held at the Patrick L. O'Daniel Unit, a Gatesville prison that houses women on death row.",
      "One of those inmates is Melissa Lucio, who has been on death row in Texas since 2008 in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Mariah. Last November, the judge who presided over Lucio's murder trial ruled there was clear and convincing evidence that Mariah died from an accidental fall, and said Lucio \"is actually innocent.\"",

    "story": [
      "Researchers in Spain have unearthed a fossil from a potential new prehistoric member of the human family tree, and they say it's the earliest known remnants of a face discovered in Western Europe.",
      "The facial bones from an adult were found at the Atapuerca archaeological site in northern Spain in 2022. Since then, a team of scientists has been working to learn more about the hominin, whom they nicknamed Pink. The researchers shared their findings in a study in the journal\u00a0Nature, which was published on Tuesday.",
      "Pink's remains have been dated as between 1.1 and 1.4 million years old, the researchers said.",
      "The research \"introduces a new actor in the history of human evolution in Europe,\" study author Rosa Huguet, of Spain's University of Rovira i Virgili, said at a news conference, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The discovery suggests that early humans settled in Europe, traveling from the east side of the continent to the west, about 1.4 million years ago, the researchers said. Until now, the oldest-known human species in Western Europe was the\u00a0Homo antecessor. Experts have found Homo antecessor remains that are around 850,000 years old.",
      "The oldest human ancestor found in any area of Europe is the Dmanisi people, or Homo georgicus, a group that lived in what is now the nation of Georgia. Remains of that species have been dated back to 1.8 million years ago. They are the first members of the human family known to have traveled from Africa to Europe.",
      "The face of \"Pink\"",
      "The fossilized upper jawbone and partial cheekbone were excavated from a 52-foot-deep layer of silt and mud at Sima del Elefante, or the \"elephant pit,\" a site less than 1,000 feet from where the fossils of\u00a0Homo antecessor were discovered in 1994. The bones were not enough for researchers to determine Pink's age or gender.",
      "From those fossilized bones, researchers were able to use 3D imaging techniques to create a model of Pink's face. The face is more \"projected forward and more robust\" than a modern human face or a\u00a0Homo antecessor face, Maria Martinon-Torres, director of Spain's National Research Center on Human Evolution, told the AFP.",
      "Pink's face bears some similarities to the human ancestor Homo erectus,\u00a0researchers said. That species spanned nearly 2 million years and was the first human species to evolve more familiar human body proportions and use fire and tools. Remains of the species have been found in Africa, Asia and Europe.",
      "But the similarities weren't strong enough for the scientists to confirm that Pink was a member of that species. Instead, they have proposed that Pink could belong to a new possible species, which they called Homo 'affinis' erectus.",
      "\"This is the most honest proposal we can make with the evidence we have,\" Martinon-Torres said, according to AFP.",
      "The scientists were also able to analyze small stone tools and animal bones found at the excavation site to learn more about how Pink lived. The environment at the time was a humid forest landscape, and the early human population lived alongside horses, ancient cattle, monkeys and hippos, the researchers said. The area also likely had plenty of water, which would have made it an \"ideal\" place for the species to settle, Huguet said in the news conference.",
      "The researchers suggested that the species may be a bridge between the\u00a0Homo georgicus species and the\u00a0Homo antecessor species. Study co-author Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro told the AFP that it's likely the species \"probably disappeared\" during a severe global cooling era that occurred nearly 900,000 years ago.",

    "story": [
      "Get ready for March's full \"Blood Worm Moon,\" a phenomenon that will make the moon appear red during a total lunar eclipse.",
      "The full moon reaches peak illumination at 2:55 a.m. ET on Friday, March 14. The total lunar eclipse will make the moon appear red on Thursday, March 13 into the following day, depending on the time zone, according to NASA. This eclipse will be visible from Earth's Western Hemisphere.",
      "When and where to see the \"Blood Worm Moon\"",
      "While this month's full moon will rise early Friday, it will appear full from around Wednesday evening into Saturday morning, according to NASA. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for ZIP codes across the U.S. Local forecasts also include detailed information on how clear the night sky will be in various locations.",
      "The \"Blood Moon\" phenomenon will start before the full moon reaches peak illumination. As the lunar eclipse begins, the moon will start moving through Earth's shadow on Thursday night at 11:57 p.m. EDT. However, the moon's gradual dimming won't be noticeable until around 1:09 a.m. on Friday. The moon will be fully shaded from around 2:26 a.m. to 3:31 a.m., with the peak viewing opportunity for the red moon happening around 2:59 a.m.",
      "The moon will exit from Earth's full shadow between 3:31 a.m. and 4:48 a.m., and will leave the last of the partial shadow at 6 a.m. ending lunar eclipse.",
      "Viewers in North and South America will catch the best views of the \"Blood Worm Moon,\" though parts of Europe and Africa may catch a glimpse.",
      "How can I observe the eclipse?",
      "The moon will still be visible during the eclipse, even though it will be in full shadow of the Earth, according to NASA.",
      "You don't need any special equipment to observe a lunar eclipse, although binoculars or a telescope will enhance the view. Viewers should head to dark environment away from bright lights for the best moon viewing conditions.",
      "What is a lunar eclipse and why does it make the moon look red?",
      "When the sun, Earth and moon all align so that the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, there's a lunar eclipse. During a total lunar eclipse, like the one happening this week, the entire moon falls within the darkest part of Earth's shadow.",
      "The moon will appear red-orange when it's in the Earth's shadow. Any sunlight that's not blocked by the Earth during the eclipse will be filtered through a \"thick slice of Earth's atmosphere\" as it heads toward the moon's surface, according to NASA. This will make the moon appear red.",
      "Why is March's full moon called the worm moon?",
      "This month's full moon is also called the Worm Moon. The nickname may have come from the earthworms typically found as spring nears, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Other names for March's full moon are the Eagle Moon, Goose Moon, Crow Comes Back Moon, Sugar Moon, Wind Strong Moon and Sore Eyes Moon.",

    "story": [
      "Quetta, Pakistan \u2014\u00a0Pakistani security forces managed Wednesday to free most of the hostages who had been held on a train that was hijacked the previous day by separatist militants in the country's remote southwest, officials said. At least 30 of the militants were killed, in addition to 21 security personnel who had been aboard the train, a security official in Quetta told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai.",
      "Authorities had earlier said that about 190 of the roughly 450 passengers who were initially on the train had been rescued and were being moved to safety. More than 100 other passengers made it off the train on Tuesday. While the 21 security forces killed were apparently on the train as passengers, the official in Quetta told Yousafzai that no civilians had been killed in the attack.",
      "Militants wearing vests loaded with explosives had earlier surrounded the remaining 250 or so hostages after the attack on the train, which happened as it entered a tunnel Tuesday in Bolan, a district in the restive Balochistan province.",
      "The Baloch Liberation Army, a U.S. and Pakistani-designated terrorist organization that has waged a yearslong insurgency in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack. Spokesman Jeeyand Baloch said earlier that the group was ready to free passengers if authorities agree to release jailed militants.",
      "Authorities said those rescued Wednesday included women and children. The security official in Quetta told CBS News the terrorists may have been able to identify off-duty security personnel on the train by obtaining information relating to which passengers were traveling on discounted fares offered to such forces.",
      "According to officials who spoke earlier with The Associated Press, the train was partially inside a tunnel when the militants blew up the tracks and immobilized the engine and its nine coaches. The driver was critically wounded by gunfire and guards aboard the train were attacked, although the officials gave no details on the number of guards who were aboard, or their fate.",
      "A security officer in provincial capital of Quetta told CBS News' Yousafzai previously that the militants had split the hostages into small groups and that they were using them as human shields. The BLA warned that the life of hostages would be at risk if the government did not negotiate a release of prisoners.",
      "Local residents reported seeing dozens of coffins being transported to the area on another train, raising fears of mass casualties.",
      "One passenger, Muhammad Bashir, told local media that militants stormed the train and ordered families to leave. As he was with his family, Bashir said, the assailants told all of them to walk away and not look back.",
      "Passengers who made it out of the train on Tuesday were sent to their hometowns, while the wounded were being treated at hospitals in Balochistan's Mach district. Others were taken to Quetta, a major city about 60 miles away.",
      "The train was traveling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar when the attack took place.",
      "A hotspot for insurgencies",
      "Government spokesman Shahid Rind said helicopters were backing up Pakistani forces in the rugged region and described the attack as \"an act of terrorism.\" It is the first time that the BLA has hijacked a train.",
      "The government has rejected militant-prisoner swap demands in the past.",
      "Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long been a hotspot for separatist insurgencies against the leadership of all three countries, with militants demanding greater autonomy and a larger share of the region's natural resources.",
      "The main insurgencies, however, have centered on Pakistan and Iran. Each country's government suspects the others of supporting \u2014 or at least tolerating \u2014 some of the groups operating on the other side of the respective borders.",
      "In Iran, the militant group Jaish al-Adl has carried out many attacks in recent years. Tehran has sought help from Pakistan in countering the threat from Jaish al-Adl, and Pakistan also wants Tehran to deny sanctuaries to BLA fighters. In January 2024, the two nations engaged in a tit-for-tat airstrike targeting insurgents inside each other's border areas, killing at least 11 people, but later they quickly deescalated the situation through talks",
      "Trains in Balochistan typically have security personnel on board as members of the military frequently use them to travel from Quetta to other parts of the country. Militants have attacked trains in the past but have never managed to hijack one.",
      "In November, the BLA carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta that killed 26 people.",
      "Pakistani authorities and analysts estimate that the BLA has around 3,000 fighters.",
      "Analysts have said the train attack, putting so many civilians in danger, could backfire for the BLA.",
      "\"After failing to damage the Pakistan Army within Balochistan, BLA has shifted its targets from military to unarmed civilians. This may give them instant public and media attention, but it will weaken their support base within the civilian population, which is their ultimate objective,\" said Syed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based independent security analyst.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but least populated province. It's a hub for the country's ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government.",
      "The BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces, but has also in the past attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals working on multibillion-dollar projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC.",
      "Pakistan hosts thousands of Chinese workers as part of Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects including ports and airports in Balochistan.",

      "They run businesses. They tend bars. They pay taxes. While they are in the U.S. illegally, they are largely spared the scrutiny of that label. But still they live in fear. They are the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants in America today.",
      "Recent estimates from the Irish government suggest that there are as many as 10,000 undocumented Irish immigrants across the United States. Many have lived in the shadows for decades, waiting for a pathway to citizenship that may never come. And with a new president that has vowed to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, anxieties have been heightened.",
      "\"It's definitely a concern, definitely a worry,\" Mary, an undocumented Irish immigrant in New England, told CBS News. \"I've heard of different people, you know, getting caught up in a swoop of undocumented people \u2014 some of them may be criminals, but some of them may not be, and it's just a situation of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"",
      "Mary, and others interviewed for this story, asked that their full names not be used to maintain their anonymity.",
      "Irish privilege?",
      "While Mary fears for her own status, she says communities of color are bearing the brunt of President Trump's immigration crackdown while she can somewhat fly under the radar.",
      "\"There's some very hardworking people that have set up businesses and are employing people and all of a sudden, you know, they're on a plane somewhere, their lives have changed, and it's very hard,\" she said. \"I absolutely do feel for people.\"",
      "Aisling, an undocumented Irish waitress in Chicago, who has lived in America for eight years, says that while she is concerned she may become a \"collateral damage\" target for the administration, ICE raids in her neighborhood have targeted predominantly Latino communities \u2014 something she has condemned as racist.",
      "\"If ICE were to walk into my work, I could definitely just blend in with the crowd, but the fear for me is getting pulled over or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" she told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment as to how ICE conducts its enforcement operations and whether the characterization that they are specifically targeting Hispanic and Latino communities is a fair one.",
      "Mick, who arrived in New York from Ireland in 2000, said public treatment of Irish people in the U.S. was in many ways the opposite of what other nationalities face. \"I used to find it quite unfair hearing how locals would speak about these immigrants coming here,\" he explained. \"I'd have to remind them, say, 'Hey guys, I'm an immigrant.'\" The attitude, he said, was, \"'Yeah, but you're different.'\"",
      "Mick was undocumented for the first few years he lived in the U.S., but he is now a citizen and describes himself as a proud New Yorker. He said there was a \"much broader fear\" among immigrant communities now during the second Trump administration.",
      "\"There's tips being posted online \u2026 for people to report businesses if they suspect there's undocumented people working. It's horrible. There's definitely a feeling here, which is new and not nice,\" he said.",
      "Ciara, who arrived in the U.S. before President Trump took office, said she was on a J-1 visa, which allows for educational and cultural exchange, but working illegally on the side. \"There is a bit of a safety net\" for Irish people in the hospitality industry, she said.",
      "\"It definitely is a worry, but I think I am definitely very privileged as well. I'm a White Irish girl with a third-level [college] education, so I think I'm in a lot more secure position to a lot of other people who are undocumented.\"",
      "But immigration attorneys have told CBS News that it would be naive for Irish undocumented people to believe that they may be immune to deportation.",
      "\"When Irish people come here, they come on what we call the visa waiver program, so that allows them to come to the United States without going to the consulate in Dublin, and they can come in for 90 days and stay for 90 days, and so most of them [who are undocumented] overstay,\" John Foley, a Boston-based immigration attorney told CBS News.",
      "\"The waiver part means they waive all rights to judicial processing, meaning they can be removed or deported from the United States without going in front of a judge,\" Foley said. \"If you're an ICE officer and you need to get 40 people a week, it's Thursday and you're at 27, you don't care where the last 13 come from.\"",
      "Contribution to the American economy",
      "Tom, a New York bar owner and legal resident in Manhattan, told CBS News that he has employed many undocumented Irish workers as well as undocumented Central and South American staff in his pub over the years. He says he couldn't operate as a business owner without them.",
      "\"I'd say 90% of the restaurants and small businesses in this city would close down if you took away the [undocumented] immigrants,\" Tom said. \"The folks who want to do those jobs are people that don't have clear legal paths into America.\"",
      "An estimate from the American Immigration Council showed that undocumented immigrants in America contributed $75.6 billion in taxes in 2022. That included $29 billion in state and local taxes and $46.6 billion in federal taxes.",
      "Aisling, in Chicago, says her colleagues at the bar where she works are predominantly undocumented.",
      "\"The business relies on it, basically \u2026 people coming in applying for jobs here, it's not Americans coming in and applying. They don't want to do these jobs,\" she said.",
      "Legal pathways for undocumented immigrants are limited",
      "Mary, in New England, arrived in the U.S. in 1999. In the 26 years that she has lived in America, she has become a property owner and is self-employed.\u00a0 For the past 14 years, she has been trying to obtain sponsorship for legal residency through a legal petition from her brother, who is an American citizen. That process is still pending with no end in sight.",
      "\"There isn't really any opportunities,\" she said. \"There isn't a path right now for me.\"",
      "It's an issue facing many undocumented immigrants working in the United States today, where few legal pathways exist, and where they do, massive backlogs and bureaucracy cause long processing delays.",
      "A 2023 policy analysis\u00a0from the conservative think tank the Cato Institute said that fewer than 1% of people who want to move permanently to the United States can do so legally.",
      "One young Irish woman who overstayed her visa waiver in New York and is now working in a bar in Manhattan told CBS News that she just wants to work, but the avenues are limited.",
      "\"I would prefer to be legal and have legal status, but it was hard in general to get a visa, and I feel like now, it's 10 times harder to even consider trying to get a visa,\" she said.",
      "Mick, who eventually obtained citizenship, said he would support amnesty for people without criminal convictions who are living illegally in the U.S. and contribute to communities.",
      "\"A lot of the people who are coming to our countries and our shores are coming here because of policies that we've allowed to happen and that have benefited us for decades,\" he said. \"I feel like we should be looking after people who need help the most.

    "story": [
      "Cairo \u2014\u00a0Sarah al-Awady says she was sitting with her family early on the morning of Oct. 22, 2024, in their tent in Al-Zawaida, the town in the central Gaza Strip where the displaced Palestinians had taken shelter, when she was struck in the head by a bullet fired by an Israeli quadcopter drone.",
      "\"Suddenly I felt pain in my head, like I had been hit with an iron bar or something,\" the 18-year-old Gazan told CBS News this week. \"My family started screaming, 'a bullet, a bullet!' Everyone was panicking and they carried me and rushed me to Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital.\"",
      "CBS News has asked the Israel Defense Forces about its reported use of small-arms-equipped drones in Gaza, and about al-Awady's claim, specifically, that she was hit by one of the weapons in a camp for displaced civilians. In a statement sent Wednesday, the IDF said it \"follows international law, targeting only military objectives and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.\"",
      "The military said it could not give details about the various aircraft it uses, \"as they are classified for security reasons, and to avoid compromising the operational capabilities of the IDF,\" and added that it could not provide information about al-Awady's claim without more precise information on the time and location of the shooting.",
      "The doctors did what they could with what little they had amid the devastation in Gaza, just over a year after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack sparked the war in the Palestinian territory. They could see that the bullet was lodged in al-Awady's skull, behind her right eye, but they didn't have the capacity to remove it.",
      "Al-Awady was eventually told there was nothing more the doctors in Gaza could do, but she refused to give up hope and insisted on staying in the hospital. At the very least, she thought, inside the hospital her badly wounded eye would be protected from the dusty conditions in her family's makeshift home.",
      "So she remained, relying on painkillers to cope with the excruciating pain in her head, but without any plan for relief in sight.",
      "In early November, al-Awady was seen by a team of volunteer medics visiting the European Hospital near Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. Dr. Mohamed Tawfik, an Egyptian, was among the volunteers, and when he saw al-Awady, he thought of someone he believed could help.",
      "Tawfik called his father, a veteran ophthalmologist, to get his medical opinion.",
      "Dr. Ahmed Tawfik, the elder doctor, told CBS News he wanted to go to Gaza to try to help the young woman, but the southern Rafah border crossing between the enclave and Egypt was closed.",
      "\"I followed this case almost daily. I felt this was my case,\" Tawfik said.",
      "But he could not find a way to travel to Gaza and, at the time, with the war still raging, Israel was permitting very few people to leave the enclave, even for medical treatment.",
      "The doctor's son returned to Egypt, and al-Awady told CBS News she started giving up hope. For months she said she lived in fear that she would permanently lose sight in her right eye.",
      "\"I applied for treatment abroad, like many others. When people asked me, 'How long have you been waiting?' I'd say a month. They'd tell me, 'Forget it, we've been waiting for so much longer.'\"",
      "A glimmer of hope would finally come, about three months after the bullet lodged in al-Awady's head, with the news that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal. It came into effect on Jan. 19, 2024, and al-Awady was able to return to her home in the decimated north of Gaza.",
      "She said she was relieved to find her family's home among the few buildings spared from the destruction. She stayed there for a week, until, on the evening of February 8, she received a call from the World Health Organization, telling her she would be leaving the following day for Egypt.",
      "\"There is no electricity, so I literally packed my luggage by candlelight,\" she recalled. Only her mother was permitted to travel with her, but the pair reached Egypt the next day, as planned.",
      "She was sent first to the city of Port Said, on Egypt's Mediterranean coast. A week later, Dr. Tawfik managed to get her moved to the hospital where he works in Al-Sharqia Governorate, in the Nile Delta.",
      "Three teams \u2014 ophthalmology, neurosurgery and radiology \u2014 worked together, debating the best approach to remove the bullet that had been lodged for months right next to al-Awady's optic nerve.",
      "\"We ran several simulations to find the best route to avoid the optic nerve,\" Dr. Mohamed Khaled Shawky, of the Al Nour Radiology Center, told CBS News. He helped guide the surgery remotely via a video link from his workstation at the separate facility.",
      "\"The bullet landed in the best possible place for the patient, but the worst place for a medical team,\" Shawky told CBS News. \"Had it moved a millimeter in any direction, it would have caused great damage.\"",
      "The doctors agreed the best option was to try to reach the bullet by entering through al-Awady's eye socket, to avoid damaging her brain.",
      "Tawfik was direct, telling al-Awady there was a 50% chance of success, a risk of internal bleeding, and she could lose her eye entirely or have her vision severely impaired.",
      "\"I cried. I was very scared, but I prayed and accepted the risk,\" she told CBS News.",
      "\"His amazing medical team tried their best to improve my spirit, to make me psychologically ready, and they did. I entered the operating room laughing and full of joy,\" al-Awady said",
      "The surgery was carried out last week, and it was a success. Tawfik told CBS News he was surprised by the amount of infection and abscess caused by the bullet, which had rusted over time inside al-Awady's head.",
      "Even with the bullet out, al-Awady is not fully out of the woods.",
      "\"Three hours later, I opened my eyes and they told me that, thanks to God, all went well,\" she recalled. \"I started crying again.\"",
      "\"She is very stable now, and she is taking her meds and getting better,\" Tawfik told CBS News. \"My goal was first to end the pain caused by the infection and, second, to preserve her current eyesight level. I am hoping that after we deal with the retinal detachment her sight will improve.\"",
      "The young woman's eye will never look \u2014 or see \u2014 the same way it did before she was shot.",

      "It's a confusing time for American diplomacy. After yesterday's meeting in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. appeared on Tuesday to be back in Ukraine's corner \u2014 and calling on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the war it started more than three years ago. It remained entirely unclear on Wednesday, however, whether Vladimir Putin might agree to a temporary ceasefire. His forces currently have the momentum on the battlefield but, like Ukraine, Russia is thought to have suffered hundreds of thousands of military casualties.",
      "\"We're going to tell (the Russians) this is what's on the table. Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking, and now it'll be up to them to say yes or no,\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after the meeting in Jeddah. \"If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here\u2026 The ball's now in their court.\"",
      "Russia hedges, but notes battlefield \"dynamics are good\" for Putin",
      "The Kremlin said Wednesday that it needed more details on the proposal and time to consider it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow assumed that Rubio, who led the U.S. delegation at the talks with Ukraine on Tuesday, would be briefing Russian counterparts \"on the details of the negotiations in Saudi Arabia,\" but that before such information was shared, \"Russia does not want to get ahead of itself on the issue of the proposed truce.\"",
      "\"Contacts are planned in the coming days,\" Peskov said.",
      "Mr. Trump's special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, is expected to head to Russia for talks later this week. Peskov indicated those talks could lead to another telephone conversation between Putin and Mr. Trump. He said there were no concrete plans for such a conversation yet, but \"if necessary, [it] can be organized very quickly.\"",
      "The Kremlin spokesman hinted, however, that Russia's bargaining position in any looming ceasefire talks was only getting stronger with every passing day. Putin's forces have continued a slow but steady advance in recent weeks, retaking ground in Russia's western border region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces staged a shock incursion last year.",
      "\"The Kremlin is closely monitoring information from the military in the Kursk region,\" Peskov said. \"The data shows that Russian forces are advancing successfully, the dynamics are good.\"",
      "Russia's military said Wednesday that forces had retaken five more small villages in Kursk from Ukrainian troops. Russia also unleashed a fresh rocket attack on Ukraine overnight, with the State Emergency Service reporting strikes on Zelenskyy's heavily bombarded hometown of Kryvyi Rih. The service said apartment buildings, administrative buildings, a shop, an educational institution, buses and other vehicles were damaged in the strikes, and it accused Russia of then shelling rescuers who had responded. Local media reports said at least nine people were wounded and one woman, a passerby, was killed.",
      "The White House's shifting Ukraine policy",
      "The White House's shift after the meeting in Saudi Arabia \u2014 clearly putting the onus back on Moscow to end the war that Putin launched more than three years ago \u2014 was the second dramatic turn by the Trump administration in less than a month as it steers America's policy on Ukraine. It stood in stark contrast to the meeting Zelenskyy had just weeks ago in Washington, when Mr. Trump called the elected Ukrainian president \"a dictator,\" said he didn't \"have the cards right now\" to negotiate the terms of a truce, and then publicly berated him in the Oval Office.",
      "Mr. Trump then ordered the suspension of U.S. security assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine \u2014 both of which are crucial to the country standing any chance of holding Russia's advancing forces at bay.",
      "The pause was lifted Tuesday upon news of the agreement between Washington and Kyiv on a framework for a 30-day ceasefire, immediately unblocking a consignment of weapons already promised to Kyiv \u2014 roughly $3.8 billion worth of air defense systems, HIMARS rockets, artillery and support for Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.",
      "In Poland, a U.S. NATO ally that shares a long border with western Ukraine and has staunchly supported Zelenskyy throughout the war, Prime Minister Donald Tusk lauded the \"important step towards peace,\" as the country's defense ministry confirmed the transfer of U.S.-supplied weapons had resumed across the Polish border.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, both of whom have indicated a willingness to send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine as part of any eventual truce deal, both hailed the progress in Jeddah, with Starmer calling it a \"remarkable breakthrough,\" while Macron cautioned that Kyiv would still need \"robust\" security guarantees as part of a ceasefire, to ward off any future Russian aggression.",
      "Rubio, speaking to reporters Wednesday, appeared to add further nuance to the White House's stance on the position of Ukraine and its neighbors, saying European nations would \"have to be involved\" in reaching a ceasefire, and framing the ongoing discussions as being \"about deterrence for Ukraine against future aggression.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and other senior U.S. officials have for weeks played down the importance of security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and completely ruled out any suggestion of U.S. boots on the ground. They have insisted that a new economic deal between Kyiv and Washington, aimed at granting U.S. access to Ukraine's reserves of highly-sought after mineral resources, would bring American investment that would effectively deter Russia, without a clear U.S. military commitment.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday, according to the Reuters news agency, that he would not frame a U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal as a deterrent to Russia.",
      "\"There's different ways to construct a deterrent on the ground that prevents another war from starting in the future,\" Rubio said, stressing that the Trump administration wasn't approaching the concept of security guarantees \"with any sort of preconceived notion.\"",
      "\"The bottom line,\" he said, \"is it needs to be something that makes Ukraine feel as if they can deter and prevent a future invasion.\"",
      "During the first three years of war, the U.S. government committed well over $100 billion to support Ukraine, helping defend a young democracy against Russia's aggression.",
      "That cause has drawn many volunteers from around the world to help train and fight alongside Ukraine's forces, including Americans who've come as private citizens, risking their own personal safety. CBS News has met Americans helping train Ukrainian soldiers and evacuating civilians from front-line areas.",
      "It's believed that hundreds of American volunteers, many of them U.S. veterans, have signed up to serve with Ukraine's army. For some of them, the U.S. administration's recent actions and rhetoric \u2014 particularly remarks by Mr. Trump that echoed Kremlin talking points, suggesting the war is Kyiv's fault and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader \u2014 have not sat well.",
      "One American fighting for Ukraine's survival posted a video on social media after that explosive meeting at the White House, describing it in no uncertain terms as \"basically Russian propaganda out of the mouth of an American president.\"",
      "\"It's shameful,\" said the man, who identified himself in the video as \"Nasty,\" an American volunteer fighting with a unit of the Ukrainian National Guard in the Kharkiv region. \"I voted for that man two times. I've always been a diehard Trump supporter, to the point of losing friends over standing up for that man and what he says on TV. But last night he crossed a line.\"",

      "British police on Tuesday arrested the captain of a cargo ship on suspicion of manslaughter as they searched for answers about why it\u00a0hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military\u00a0off eastern England a day earlier, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor was presumed dead in the collision.",
      "Humberside Police said the 59-year-old was detained \"on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.\" He wasn't named by the police and has not been charged.",
      "Shipping company Ernst Russ, the owner of the Portugal-flagged container carrier the Solong, said the arrested man was the ship's master, whom the firm identified on Wednesday as a Russian national. It said he \"and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations.\"",
      "The company said the ship's 14 crew members were a mix of Russian and Filipino nationals.",
      "U.K. authorities have said they don't suspect foul play in the collision.",
      "An American crew member of the U.S.-flagged Stena Immaculate tanker who anonymously spoke to CBS News because he wasn't permitted to speak with media about the crash said the vessel had been anchored on the spot where the collision occurred. The tanker had relayed its coordinates, the man said, meaning all other vessels in the area should have known its position.",
      "The crew member said the Solong\u00a0\"came out of the blue\"\u00a0and struck the Stena.",
      "He said he was near to the part of the Stena where the Solong made its impact, and that he had only seconds to react when he heard shouts to brace before impact.",
      "The government said the cause of the collision was being investigated. There was no indication of foul play, but it sparked fears of significant environmental damage.",
      "U.K. officials were watching for damage to birds and sea life after jet fuel poured into the North Sea when the Solong broadsided the Stena Monday. The collision sparked explosions and fires that burned for more than 24 hours.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News Monday that the Stena was carrying cargo in support of the Defense Department. The collision did not impact operations or combat readiness, the official said.",
      "Footage filmed from a helicopter on Tuesday morning showed the fire appeared to largely be out on the Stena, which had a large gash on its port side.",
      "The U.K. coast guard agency said Tuesday that the Solong was still alight. It said the cargo ship, whose front end was crushed and blackened, was drifting south, away from the tanker, and an approximately half-mile exclusion zone had been put in place around both ships.",
      "\"No sign of pollution from vessels is observed at this time,\" British Transport Minister Mike Kane told lawmakers in the House of Commons.",
      "The government said air quality readings were normal and the risk to public health onshore was \"very low.\"",
      "Kane initially said the Solong was expected to sink, but the government said later that both vessels were likely to stay afloat.",
      "The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea.",
      "All but one of the 37 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore in the port of Grimsby, about 150 miles (north of London, with no major injuries. One crew member was missing, and the coast guards called off the search late Monday.",
      "\"Our working assumption is that, very sadly, the sailor is deceased,\" Kane said.",
      "The U.K. Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun gathering evidence of what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth, Scotland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored about 10 miles off the English coast.",
      "The investigation will be led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.",
      "The 596-foot Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. Its operator, U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, said that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel in 16 tanks, at least one of which was ruptured.",
      "The company said it was unclear how much fuel had leaked into the sea.",
      "The North Sea is home to a number of protected marine animals, as well as vital fishing stocks for the U.K. and other European countries.",
      "Oceana U.K. believes the collision took place near two protected areas in particular, including the Southern North Sea marine protected area, which is designated to protect the harbor porpoise, according to Naomi Tilley, the Oil and Gas Campaign Lead at Oceana U.K., an environmental group focused on oceans.",
      "\"It's a really important area of breeding and a really large portion of the global population is found in that area,\" she told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The owner of the Solong said that contrary to earlier reports, the vessel wasn't carrying containers of sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water. It said that four empty containers had previously contained the chemical.",

      "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia \u2014 The U.S. and Ukraine said Kyiv would accept a 30-day ceasefire with Russia after talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, with Washington pledging to immediately lift a freeze on intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine.",
      "\"Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,\"\u00a0 the U.S. and Ukraine said in a joint statement released by the State Department. \"The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace.\"",
      "The agreement came after more than eight hours of\u00a0negotiations\u00a0between Ukrainian officials and a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Saudi city of Jeddah.",
      "The statement said the U.S. \"will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.\" Both were frozen\u00a0in the wake of an explosive meeting between Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Trump at the White House on Feb. 28.",
      "The now-unfrozen military aid includes roughly $1 billion in equipment that was approved by the Biden administration and has not yet been delivered. The Trump administration has the authority to provide another $3.8 billion in aid but has not announced any further aid packages. Ukraine has been buoyed by the U.S. and other Western allies in its fight against Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, and the move to cut off aid left Kyiv at a disadvantage and European allies scrambling.",
      "Whether Russia will support a ceasefire remains to be seen. Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy, plans to visit Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, sources familiar with the planning told CBS News. Witkoff met with Putin for more than three hours in February.",

We hope the Russians will reciprocate.\"",
      "The statement from the U.S. and Ukraine said they would each \"name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security.\"",
      "It also said Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy would \"conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.\" Washington has been pushing Kyiv to sign a deal which would grant the U.S. access to its mineral reserves, and Zelenskyy indicated his readiness to sign a deal ahead of the talks.",
      "Rubio led the U.S. delegation to Saudi Arabia, supported by Witkoff and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Zelenskyy was visiting Saudi Arabia at the time of the talks, but did not participate.",
      "Ahead of the talks, a senior Ukrainian official said his message to the U.S. team was the Kyiv was ready to make a peace deal with Russia, and that while Zelenskyy might still want Western security guarantees as part of the deal to deter any future Russian aggression, the focus was \"how to start this process.\"",
      "Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said his delegation's central message for the U.S. was that \"Ukrainians want a peace,\" and that Ukraine was \"ready to go\" to work toward that goal.",

      "\"At this stage, it's too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage,\" Greenpeace U.K. said in a statement early Tuesday, explaining that the severity of any impact would depend on a number of factors, including \"the amount and type of oil carried by the tanker, the fuel carried by both ships, and how much of that, if any, has entered the water.\"",
      "The U.K. Coastguard said its Counter Pollution and Salvage Team was \"assessing the situation\" and \"developing a plan ready for implementation as soon as the situation allows.\"",
      "Air quality in the area was reported to be normal, and there was a \"very low\" public health risk on nearby shores, according to the U.K. Health Security Agency.",
      "\"It's really hard to know at this stage what is in the water and how that's going to behave, but almost in any circumstances, it's bad news,\" Tilley told CBS News.",
      "Tanker collision near protected marine areas",
      "The North Sea is home to a number of protected marine animals, as well as vital fishing stocks for the U.K. and other European countries.",
      "Oceana U.K. believes the collision took place near two protected areas in particular, including the Southern North Sea marine protected area, which is designated to protect the harbor porpoise, Tilley said.",
      "\"It's a really important area of breeding and a really large portion of the global population is found in that area,\" she said.",
      "The harbor porpoise is a \"species that needs to come to the surface to breathe, so it won't easily be able to avoid slicks on the surface,\" Tilley told CBS News.",
      "The Holderness Offshore marine protected area, meanwhile, is designated for the safety of sea floor habitats.",
      "\"It's got ocean quahogs, which live for centuries. They're kind of these clams that are really long-lived. And starfish and underwater sponges and things\u2026 They're both really important parts of the sea and they're very close, if not where this incident has happened,\" Tilley said.",
      "Possible contaminants",
      "Both of the vessels involved in the collision would have had their own fuel for propulsion, and the American tanker that was hit, the MV Stena Immaculate, was also transporting jet fuel, according to Crowley, the U.S. logistics group that operates the vessel.",
      "Jet fuel is toxic for marine life, and Crowley said some of it had been released in the crash.",
      "\"The Stena Immaculate sustained a ruptured cargo tank containing Jet-A1 fuel due to the collision,\" Crowley said in a statement to the Reuters news agency. \"A fire occurred as a result.\"",
      "It was still unclear Tuesday how much jet fuel had been released and how much might already have burned off in the fire.",
      "Initial reports indicated that containers carrying sodium cyanide were on board the other ship, a Portuguese-flagged cargo ship called the MV Solong. Sodium cyanide is a toxic substance that evaporates quickly and could have created dangerous air conditions on the surface of the water for cleanup crews and animals.",
      "The shipping company that operates the vessel, however, Ernst Rust, said Tuesday that there were no containers containing sodium cyanide on the Solong, but that there were four that had previously contained the chemical and they were being monitored.",
      "Potential risks to fishing industry - and consumers",
      "Tilley said pollution from the collision could impact fish stocks in the North Sea and the people that rely on them.",
      "\"The North Sea is a hugely important area for U.K. fishing fleets, but also European fishing fleets,\" Tilley said.",
      "The extent of any environmental contamination is still unknown, she said, but it \"could have really long-term impacts for the community, like whether the chemicals end up in the water. If that impacts the fish stocks and the population of fish that we eat, then that could have an impact on the fishing industry.\"",
      "Tilley noted that previous large oil spills had \"resulted in quite an enormous area where fishing wasn't allowed because of contaminated fish for quite a long long time.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:44:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been arrested on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.",
    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Manila's international airport Tuesday on order of the International Criminal Court in connection with a case of crime against humanity filed against him, the Philippine government said.",
      "Duterte was arrested after arriving from Hong Kong and police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the mass killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement.",
      "\"Upon his arrival, the prosecutor general served the ICC notification for an arrest warrant to the former president for the crime of crime against humanity,\" the government said. \"He's now in the custody of authorities.\"",
      "The surprise arrest sparked a commotion at the airport when lawyers and Duterte aides loudly protested that they, along with a doctor and lawyers, were prevented from coming close to him after he was taken into police custody. \"This is a violation of his constitutional right,\" Sen. Bong Go, a close Duterte ally, told reporters.",
      "Duterte's former lawyer and spokesperson, Salvador Panelo, asserted in a statement that the warrant came from \"a spurious source,\" since the ICC has no jurisdiction in the Philippines, the Reuters news agency reported. The ICC says it has jurisdiction there over alleged crimes committed before the country withdrew as a member.",
      "The arrest warrant sent by the ICC to Philippine officials, a copy of which was seen by The AP, said, \"There are reasonable grounds to believe\" the attack on victims \"was both widespread and systematic: The attack took place over a period of several years and thousands people appear to have been killed.\"",
      "Duterte's arrest was necessary \"to ensure his appearance before the court,\" according to the March 7 warrant, adding that the former president was expected to ignore a court summons.",
      "It said that although Duterte was no longer president, he \"appears to continue to wield considerable power.\"",
      "\"Mindful of the resultant risk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims, the chamber is satisfied that the arrest of Mr. Duterte is necessary,\" it said.",
      "A photo released by his political party said he was being held at the Villamor Air Base next to Manila airport, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "The government said Duterte was in good health.",
      "Relatives of victims of Duterte drug killings react",
      "Duterte's arrest and downfall stunned families of the victims of his bloody crackdowns against illegal drugs and drove them to tears.",
      "\"This is a big, long-awaited day for justice,\" Randy delos Santos, the uncle of a teenager killed by police during an anti-drug operation in August 2017 in the Manila metropolis, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Now we feel that justice is rolling. We hope that top police officials and the hundreds of police officers who were involved in the illegal killings should also be placed in custody and punished,\" delos Santos said.",
      "Three of the police officers who killed his nephew, Kian delos Santos, were convicted in 2018 for the high-profile murder, which prompted Duterte at the time to temporarily suspend his brutal anti-drugs crackdown.",
      "The conviction was one of at least three, so far, against law enforcement personnel involved in the anti-drugs campaign, reflecting the concerns of families of victims of suspected extrajudicial killings that they wouldn't get justice in the Philippines, which led to their decision to seek the help of the ICC.",
      "Long history of drug killings under Duterte",
      "The ICC investigated drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. In 2019, Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.",
      "The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by noting that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC \u2014 a court of last resort \u2014 didn't have jurisdiction.",
      "Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration's objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asked international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a criminal suspect.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles had the lowest air quality in the United States in 2024, according to the annual World Air Quality Report from IQAir.",
      "The annual report looks at data from more than more than 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, territories and regions, according to IQAir, an air technology company based in Switzerland.",
      "The rankings are based on the annual average of concentrated micrograms of an air pollutant per cubic meter of air. The World Health Organization recommends 5 micrograms of pollutant per cubic meter.",
      "Which countries have the lowest air quality?",
      "Worldwide, the countries with the worst air quality were Chad, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and India. Chad had 91.5 micrograms of pollutant per cubic meter, IQAir said \u2014 more than 18 times more than what the WHO recommends. Bangladesh had 78, Pakistan had 73.7, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had 58.2, and India had 50.6 micrograms per cubic meter.",
      "But Byrnihat, India was the most polluted metropolitan area in 2024, the IQAir report said. The city had an annual average concentration of 128.2 micrograms per cubic meter of air. India was home to six of the nine most polluted global cities, IQAir said.",
      "One hundred and twenty-six countries, or 91.3% of the world, exceeded the WHO guideline, according to the report.",
      "Conditions on the ground in various countries can affect the amount of pollutants per cubic meter, IQAir said. Wildfires in the Amazon caused levels in parts of Brazil to nearly quadruple in the fall. The entire continent of Africa only has one moniotring station for every 3.7 million people, IQAir said, which may lead to inaccurate data for the region.",
      "What parts of the U.S. have the best and worst air quality?",
      "Most cities in the United States had between 5.1 and 15 micrograms of pollution per cubic meter of air, according to IQAir. A number of cities, especially along the West Coast, New England and in the Southwest, had between 0 and 5 micrograms of pollution per cubic meter, meeting WHO guidelines.",
      "The major city with the worst air pollution was Los Angeles, California. The smaller municipality of Ontario, California, had the most pollution of any city, the report said.",
      "Seattle, Washington was the cleanest major city in the U.S., according to IQAir.",
      "What parts of the world have the best air quality?",
      "Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand met the WHO guideline for air quality. The cleanest metropolitan area in the world was Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, with an annual average concentration of 1.1 micrograms per cubic meter of air.",
      "The cleanest region is Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and hundreds of smaller islands. Fifty-seven percent of cities in the region met the WHO guideline, the IQAir report found.",
      "Seventeen percent of cities included in the report met the annual WHO guideline, IQAir said. That's an increase from 2023, when just 9% of cities met the guideline.",
      "\"While this marks some progress, much more work has yet to be done to protect human health, especially that of children,\" IQAir said in the report.",
      "Why is air quality so important?",
      "Air pollution is a \"critical threat to both human health and environmental stability, IQAir CEO Frank Hammes said in a news release announcing the findings of the report.",
      "Ninety-nine percent of the world's population lives in areas that do not meet recommended air quality guideline levels, according to WHO. Air pollution is the second leading global risk factor for death. In 2021, 8.1 million deaths worldwide could be attributed to air pollution, IQAir said.",
      "Exposure to concentrated micrograms of an air pollutant caused about 58% of those deaths, IQAir said. Exposure to micrograms of pollutants can contribute to and exacerbate health conditions including asthma, cancer, stroke and lung diseases. Children may face issues with respiratory and developmental health.",

      "Meghan Markle's new show drew comparisons to those of Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray. (Getty)",
      "\"In marketing, there is aspirational marketing and relatability marketing. Martha Stewart was aspirational; Rachael Ray was relatable. Each personality came at it from a different direction, but managed to connect with their audiences (because they were authentic) and in so doing, climbed to the top of the lifestyle mountain, respectively,\" Eldrige said.",
      "He continued, \"Connection comes in two forms, but regardless of the path or direction, it remains the critical first step in any creative or marketing endeavor.\"",
      "A lack of authenticity was one of the most pervasive complaints from critics who took issue with \"With Love, Meghan\" and Markle as its host, with some noting that the show's setting was a contributing factor.",
      "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle married on May 19, 2018, at Windsor Castle. (Getty Images)",
      "The show wasn't filmed at the Montecito home that Markle shares with her husband Prince Harry, 40, and their children Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3.

      "Production for Ray's \"The Rachael Ray Show\" primarily took place at Chelsea Television Studios in New York City, though some episodes were filmed at the Food Network star's house in Lake Luzerne, New York.",
      "While speaking to Fox News Digital, Eldridge emphasized the importance of authenticity for a show or brand.",
      "\"Authenticity is like humidity \u2014 you can't see it, but you can walk in a room and feel it,\" he said. \"It's also critical for what Markle is trying to accomplish. Authenticity fosters relatability, which in turn creates likability, all of which are needed for marketability.\"",
      "The PR expert noted that the immense popularity of Markle's late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, stemmed from her authenticity.",
      "\"Connection comes from authenticity and relatability; the audience needs to see something of themselves in you,\" Eldridge said. \"The reason Diana was referred to as 'The People's Princess' is because people across the U.K. felt a connection to her \u2014 they felt she was both 'one of them' and a princess nonetheless. It was a rare feat and a testament to Dianna's likability, but again, it all started with her authenticity and sense of relatability.\"",

      "McCormick also shared his observation that Markle's on-screen demeanor may have made it difficult for audiences to connect to her.",

Products will be available on the brand\u2019s official website, per the outlet.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, Eldrige explained that Markle likely faces an uphill battle as she attempts to build her lifestyle empire.",
      "\"It's difficult; over the last 20 years, this has become an increasingly crowded space and there are few 'fresh ideas' from which to draw,\" he said. \"At this point, it's less about talent or training, and more likability and charisma.\"",
      "\"The latter creates an additional hurdle for Markle to clear, due to her polarizing reputation and sagging Q score,\" Eldridge added. \"It's like starting a cross-country road trip with a slow leak in one of your tires \u2014 you might make it, but what was already going to be a long, hard, trip just got that much trickier.\"",

      "\"Let\u2019s dispense with the nonsense \u2014 this isn\u2019t a debate over free speech; it\u2019s a matter of national security, plain and simple,\" he said. \"The First Amendment protects words, not actions taken in service of a terrorist cause.\"",
      "Blumencranz took issue with New York leadership's handling of the arrest, arguing that Democrats such as Gov. Kathy Hochul turned a blind eye to the protests that broke out on Columbia's campus in 2024, which included Jewish students reporting that they feared for their safety and left campus.",
      "\"This is the radical left\u2019s twisted game: hijack the language of civil rights to shield those who openly support terror,\" he said. \"Cry \u2018free speech\u2019 when it\u2019s convenient, stay silent when the mobs descend on Jewish students, and pretend that a man aiding Hamas is just a misunderstood activist. It\u2019s a disgrace.\"",
      "\"Let\u2019s be crystal clear \u2014 a green card is not a birthright,\" he said. \"It is a privilege. The United States has every right, and indeed a duty, to revoke it from anyone who uses their time here to foment extremism. But instead of backing law and order, politicians like Letitia James, Chuck Schumer, Kathy Hochul, Hakeem Jeffries and their radical allies are tripping over themselves to defend Khalil, all while ignoring the real victims: Jewish students forced to flee their own campus.\"",

Greer, said in a Monday statement. \"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent in violation of the First Amendment.\u00a0While tomorrow or thereafter the government may cite the law or process, that toothpaste is out of the tube and irreversibly so.\u00a0The government\u2019s objective is as transparent as it is unlawful, and our role as Mahmoud\u2019s lawyers is to ensure it does not prevail.\"",

      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. Antivirus software can help detect and prevent infostealer malware infections. Be sure to perform regular scans to identify and remove potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware potentially accessing your private information is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Use virtual cards for online payments: Instead of using your actual bank card, generate virtual cards through your bank or a service like Privacy.com. These temporary cards limit exposure in case of a data breach.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Enable transaction alerts and spending limits:\u00a0Set up real-time alerts for transactions and daily spending limits on your cards. This way, you\u2019ll be notified immediately of any unauthorized activity.",
      "4. Never store card details in browsers:\u00a0Infostealers target autofill data in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Always deny the pop-up that asks to \"save payment info\" and use a secure password manager instead. You may also want to take advantage of additional digital security measures such as\u00a0two-factor authentication. Newer types of authentication, such as Face ID and Touch ID, are slowly replacing passwords as a legitimate means to grant a person access to sensitive financial information.",
      "5. Be smart about passwords: Simply employing all the password rules won\u2019t prevent a breach, but since you don\u2019t know exactly what information thieves are looking for, it can\u2019t hurt. You should use strong passwords and change them frequently. I recommend using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

However, since this malware often disguises itself as legitimate apps or uses social engineering tricks, it\u2019s easy to get fooled. Even the most cautious individuals can fall victim to a well-executed campaign. The best way to stay safe is to exercise caution when browsing online, downloading apps or making online transactions.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "SpyLoan apps are everywhere and\u00a0yet people keep falling for them. They promise easy loans with flexible repayment, but what they actually do is steal your personal data, including contacts, sensitive images and files. The moment you take a loan, they start blackmailing you using your own data against you.",
      "Some of these apps do not even bother giving loans. They just grab your data and start the harassment. One such app has been making the rounds on the Play Store, racking up more than 100,000 downloads and putting thousands of Android users at risk of blackmail and extortion.",

      "How SpyLend malware spreads and leads to scams and extortion",
      "SpyLend spread by posing as a credible financial management tool, \"Finance Simplified,\" on the Google Play Store, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer. It attracted financially vulnerable individuals by offering fast loans with minimal documentation.",
      "The app surged from 50,000 to 100,000 downloads in a single week despite red flags in user reviews about harassment and blackmail.",
      "Once downloaded, the app requested excessive permissions far beyond what a typical financial app would need, including access to contacts, SMS messages, call logs, photos and location data. This allowed the malware to silently collect personal information from users' devices.",
      "The stolen data fueled a vicious cycle of scams and extortion. SpyLoan apps like SpyLend lure users with attractive loan terms, only to exploit their data for predatory lending practices. If users fail to meet repayment demands, the operators weaponize their information by harassing them, blackmailing them with threats of leaking private photos or contacting their friends and family, and creating a climate of fear and coercion.",
      "In some cases, the extortion escalated to public shaming or even deepfake creation using stolen images, amplifying the psychological and financial toll on victims.",
      "We reached out about this incident, and a Google spokesperson told us, \"The app has been removed from Google Play. Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by\u00a0Google Play Protect, which is on by default on Android devices with Google Play Services. Google Play Protect can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behavior, even when those apps come from sources outside of Play.\"",
      "However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all emerging malware from Android devices.",

      "Sensitive data stolen by the app",
      "SpyLend is a serious threat because it steals a huge amount of personal information. It digs into contact lists and call histories, reads text messages, including banking alerts, and grabs photos and videos from storage.",
      "It also collects device details like the model and OS version, tracks location in real time every three seconds, records past locations and IP addresses, and it even saves the last 20 copied texts from the clipboard. On top of that, it gathers financial data like loan histories and banking SMS messages.",
      "This stolen data is not just used for blackmail, as it is often sold to cybercriminals. By preying on people already struggling financially, SpyLend puts nearly every part of their digital lives at risk.",

      "1) Avoid suspicious loan apps: Stick to apps from well-known banks, credit unions or lenders registered with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or other regulatory bodies.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: Use strong antivirus protection on all your devices to detect and prevent malicious apps. This can also protect against phishing emails and ransomware scams. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious apps is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "4) Review app permissions carefully: If an app asks for unnecessary permissions, like access to your contacts, call logs or storage, do not install it. A legitimate loan app should only require essential permissions related to financial transactions.",
      "5) Check reviews and red flags: Before installing any financial app, read user reviews carefully. If multiple people report harassment, blackmail or excessive permissions, avoid the app entirely.",
      "6) Report and uninstall suspicious apps: If you encounter a SpyLoan app, immediately\u00a0uninstall it and revoke its permissions. Report it to the Google Play Store, cybersecurity authorities and financial regulators to help prevent further victims.",
      "If you\u2019ve shared sensitive information, consider changing passwords and securing your accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The promise of quick and easy money can be tempting, especially during tough times, making it easy to fall for these scams. However, there are safer and more reliable ways to take loans. As a general rule, it is best to avoid borrowing money through online apps unless they are from well-known financial institutions. Google also needs to take responsibility for allowing SpyLoan apps on the Play Store, even when user reviews clearly indicate they are malicious.",

      "Urgency as a weapon: Scammers exploit our fear of financial loss to prompt hasty actions. They use phrases like, in this case, \"Act now\" or \"Cancel Now\" and warn of dire consequences if immediate action isn't taken. This urgency is designed to bypass rational thinking and prevent you from verifying the legitimacy of the request.",
      "Suspicious links: Legitimate banks avoid sending security-sensitive links via text. These links could download viruses to your device or lead you to a fake website designed to steal your personal information. Always verify the URL before entering any sensitive data.",
      "Specific yet unfamiliar details: The mention of \"Bryana White\" and the precise amount of $950.44 is a clever tactic. Scammers often use specific details to create an illusion of legitimacy, even when these details are unfamiliar to the recipient. This approach aims to instill doubt and urgency, increasing the chances that the victim will act hastily.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Brand impersonation: Scammers often employ brand impersonation tactics, using similar logos, fonts and color schemes to create a facade of legitimacy. This deceptive strategy is designed to manipulate you into believing you are interacting with a trusted institution, thereby increasing the likelihood of falling for their scam.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Be wary of unexpected texts claiming to be from your bank, especially if you haven't signed up for text alerts.",
      "Spelling and grammatical errors: Look for mistakes in spelling, grammar or punctuation. Legitimate messages from banks are usually written by professionals and are free of errors.",
      "Requests for personal information: Scammers often ask you to \"confirm\" details like your account number or password. Legitimate banks never request sensitive information via text.",
      "Too good to be true offers: Be skeptical of messages promising large returns or unexpected windfalls.",

      "2. Have strong antivirus software: This can help detect and block malicious software that might be downloaded if Jane had clicked on the scammer's link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Contact your bank directly using official channels: Jane should call Kinecta's official number to verify if there's any real issue with her account, rather than responding to the text.",
      "4. Report the text to your bank and forward it to 7726 (SPAM): By reporting this text, Jane can help Kinecta and her mobile carrier protect other customers from similar scams.",
      "5. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) on your accounts: This extra layer of security could prevent scammers from accessing Jane's account even if they obtained her password.",
      "6. Use SMS filtering tools provided by your mobile carrier: These tools might have caught and flagged the suspicious \"Kinect\" text before it reached Jane's inbox.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: This can help reduce the amount of personal information available online, making it harder for scammers to target Jane and you with personalized attacks in the future. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Remember, legitimate financial institutions will never pressure you to act immediately or click on links in text messages. When in doubt, always reach out to your bank directly using official channels. Thank you, Jane, for bringing this to our attention.

      "How were the extensions compromised?",
      "GitLab Security has uncovered a major security breach affecting over 3.2 million users through a network of compromised browser extensions, including some linked to GitLab. The attack stemmed from a supply chain breach, where threat actors infiltrated legitimate extensions and pushed malicious updates. These updates embedded hidden scripts that allowed unauthorized data collection, altered HTTP requests and injected ads into web pages, all without users noticing.",
      "Originally built for tasks like ad blocking, emoji input and screen recording, these extensions were repurposed through covert updates that exploited the extensive permissions users had granted, enabling real-time manipulation of web activity.",
      "Typically, malicious extensions or apps are created solely to steal data, with their advertised functionality being an afterthought or simply a way to get listed in an official store. That was not the case here. These were legitimate extensions that became harmful only after attackers injected malicious updates into them.",

      "Which extensions are affected?",
      "Several of the compromised extensions are commonly utilized and may be present in your browser. For instance, ad blockers such as AdBlock are valued for eliminating disruptive advertisements and enhancing browsing privacy. However, in this breach, these tools were manipulated to deliver malicious payloads. The following extensions have been identified as affected:",

      "If any of these extensions are installed on your browser, it is recommended that you assess their permissions and consider their removal until official security updates are verified.",
      "The malicious extensions bypassed Content Security Policy protections, which are designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to modify web content without detection. They also communicated with command-and-control servers to receive further instructions, showing a high level of coordination. The attackers exploited the trust users place in the Chrome Web Store and its automatic update system. Investigations suggest this activity has been ongoing since at least July 2024.",
      "Some of the compromised extensions listed above have generic names that may resemble well-known and legitimate tools, but they are not the same. For example, \"Password Manager\" in our list refers to a malicious extension identified in the breach,\u00a0not to reputable password manager services we mention here.\u00a0Similarly, extensions named \"AdBlock Plus\" or \"VPN Extension\" in this context are not necessarily the widely trusted versions but rather imitations or malicious variants.",
      "To ensure you're using a legitimate extension, follow these steps.",
      "Verify the developer \u2013 Always check the extension's publisher in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons. Official brands like Norton, Google or Microsoft will be clearly listed.",
      "Check the reviews and downloads \u2013 Malicious extensions often have lower ratings, generic reviews or a small number of downloads compared to their legitimate counterparts.",
      "Avoid third-party sites \u2013 Only install browser extensions directly from trusted sources like the\u00a0Chrome Web Store,\u00a0Mozilla Add-ons or the official website of the developer.",

      "1.\u00a0Keep your browser and extensions up to date: Outdated software is a goldmine for cybercriminals. Bugs or security gaps in old versions of your browser or extensions can be exploited to inject malicious code, steal data or take control of your system. Updates patch these vulnerabilities, making them a critical line of defense. Turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2. Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons have rules and scans to catch bad actors, but they\u2019re not perfect. Extensions from random websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware. Stick to the official store for your browser. Don\u2019t download extensions from sketchy links.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer is no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the incident, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a password manager. This can help you generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Browser extensions can improve functionality but also pose significant security risks if not carefully managed. If you have any of the above extensions installed in Chrome, you should remove them immediately. Treat your browser as a key part of your digital security. Regularly check your extensions, remove unnecessary permissions and be cautious about automatic updates, even from trusted sources.",

However, the TSA does accept digital IDs with digital ID readers at\u00a0several airports, and a few concert venues have begun accepting digital IDs.

      "\"My friends and I, especially Shoshana and I, were very frustrated with it because we didn't think that the email from the Barnard student government really represented us, because we honestly felt safer having police on our campus when there was a bomb threat and when we were in an emergency situation,\" Birman told Fox News Digital. \"And we don't think that having the police promise to never come on to campus is for the betterment of the safety of our community.\"",

      "\"When we\u2019re looking at numbers in the thousands, the ability to get them over to Thailand and process them and house them and feed them would be impossible for most governments,\" said Miller. \"It really does require a kind of a global response.\"",
      "The recent abrupt halt to U.S. foreign aid funding has made it even harder to get help to released scam center workers.",
      "The United Nations\u2019 International Organization for Migration, for example, previously funded care for victims of trafficking in scam compounds in one shelter in Cambodia, but was forced to halt that work by the Trump Administration\u2019s funding freeze announced in January, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. The halt to funding has also impacted a network of civil society groups that worked to stop human trafficking and rescue survivors in Thailand.",

      "\"The United States remains deeply concerned about online scam operations throughout Southeast Asia, which affect thousands of Americans and individuals from many other countries,\" said a State Department spokesperson in a statement sent to the AP.",
      "A bigger problem",
      "While advocates estimate some 50 million people are living in modern slavery, mass rescues of enslaved workers are rare. In 2015, more than 2,000 fishermen were rescued from brutal conditions at sea, liberated after an Associated Press investigation exposed their plight. That same year hundreds of Indians were rescued from brick factories in India. And last year Brazilian prosecutors rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in \"slavery-like\" conditions at an electric vehicle factory construction site in northeastern Brazil.",
      "\"What we are seeing at the Thai-Myanmar border now is the result of years of inaction on a trafficking crisis that has had a devastating impact on thousands of people, many of whom were simply seeking better economic prospect, but were lured to these compounds on false pretenses,\" said Amnesty International Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman.",
      "Being forced to commit a crime under threat of violence should not be criminalized, said Freeman. \"However, in general we are aware of countries in the region repatriating their nationals from scam compounds only to then charge them with crimes.\"",
      "Business as usual",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much of an effect these releases will have on the criminal groups that run the scam centers.",
      "February marked the third time the Thais have cut internet or electricity to towns across the river. Each time, the compounds have managed to work around the cuts. Large compounds have access to diesel-powered generators, as well as access to internet provider Starlink, experts working with law enforcement say.",
      "\"The resources is the one thing that they are not lacking and they\u2019ve been able to bring them to bear in the past,\" said Benedikt Hoffman, acting representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in the region.",
      "The armed groups that staged the crackdown have also been accused of helping to run scam compounds in Myawaddy. The head of the Kayin Border Guard Force, General Saw Chit Thu, has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom for profiting from scam compounds and human trafficking, respectively. Compounds in the DKBA\u2019s control are less well-documented in the public record, but activists say they also control a fair number.",
      "\"There is clearly a lot of pressure on the Border Guard Force to take action and helping people to leave is one of the most visible ways to do so,\" Hoffman said. \"That said, it likely also reflects an adjustment to the business model, reducing the number of people involved \u2014 and with less attention, continuing lower key operations.\"",
      "It will take simultaneous pressure exerted in multiple areas to truly shut down the compounds, said Hoffman.",
      "In this crackdown, there have been no major prosecutions or compounds shut down.",

      "\"My friends are in really bad condition, we can\u2019t survive here,\" he said, requesting anonymity out of fear for retribution from his guards. He asks a question that's been haunting him day in and day out for weeks: \"Is anyone coming for us?\""

      "Rubio will meet with the delegation in the city of Jeddah around noon local time on Tuesday.",
      "\"The important point in this meeting is to establish clearly their intentions, their desire, as they've said publicly now, numerous times, to reach a point where peace is possible,\" Rubio said, adding that he will need to be assured that Kyiv is prepared to make some hard decisions, like giving up territory seized by Russia, in order to end the three-year war.",

      "\"Both sides need to come to an understanding,\" he said. \"The Russians can't conquer all of Ukraine, and obviously it will be very difficult for Ukraine, in any reasonable time period, to sort of force the Russians back all the way to where they were in 2014. So the only solution to this war is diplomacy and getting them to a table where that's possible.",
      "\"Then we'll have to determine how far they are from the Russian position, which we don't know yet either. And then once you understand where both sides truly are, it gives you a sense of how big the divide is and how hard it's going to be,\" Rubio explained. \"I'm hoping it'll be a positive interaction along those lines.\"",

      "While a mineral deal is unlikely to be achieved this week, according to Rubio, he said he hopes that with a successful meeting in Jeddah, he can secure the resumption of aid to Ukraine, though he did not detail if this would include the defensive aid the Trump administration halted, despite Russia\u2019s continued bombardment against Ukrainian targets, or the intelligence sharing which the U.S. also stopped following the Oval Office showdown.",

      "Using international food composition databases and the Sphere humanitarian standards, they tracked calorie intake, nutritional value, and humanitarian aid efforts, providing an objective, data-driven analysis of food supplies delivered to Gaza during the first seven months of the war.",
      "The research assessed food shipments from international donors processed through COGAT. Each item was categorized based on its energy content, protein, fat and micronutrient composition. The total nutritional supply per capita was then measured against international benchmarks to ensure accuracy.",

      "\"We didn't enter politics,\" said professor Ronit Endevelt. \"We just wanted to know if, from a nutritional perspective, the food entering Gaza was sufficient. We double-checked our data multiple times to avoid exaggeration.\"",
      "Between January and April 2024, 14,916 trucks carrying 227,854 tons of food entered Gaza, averaging 124 food trucks per day. The study found that the daily per capita caloric supply averaged 3,374 kcal, with 101 grams of protein and 80.6 grams of fat \u2013 meeting or exceeding international humanitarian food aid standards.",

      "\"In March 2024, the United Nations Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned of imminent famine in Gaza. Within days, cautious technical language gave way to media headlines and political statements claiming mass starvation was already underway,\" professor Troen told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"One of the most persistent falsehoods has been the claim that before the war, 500 or more humanitarian trucks entered Gaza daily, and that this number was necessary to meet the population\u2019s needs. In reality, the number of food trucks was around or fewer than 100 per day before the war, and has since increased substantially,\" he continued. \"Our study aimed to address that gap by analyzing verified food shipments. The numbers show that while there were variations, at no point did the food supply drop to starvation levels.\"",

      "When asked specifically about testimonies obtained by Fox News Digital from Gazans who reported struggling to find food on certain days, Endevelt acknowledged the study did not track final distribution within Gaza. \"We can\u2019t say there was no hunger, but we can confirm enough food entered,\" she said. \"Most of the time, in most months, there was enough food available.\"",
      "A key finding of the study is the distinction between food supply and distribution. \"Hamas systematically weaponized food distribution, using it as a tool of control,\" said Endevelt. \"Aid often didn\u2019t reach those in need because Hamas seized supplies, sold them on the black market, or prioritized its own fighters. Reports of famine are not due to a lack of aid but Hamas\u2019 deliberate strategy of restricting access to maintain power and profit.\"",
      "Despite these findings, the ICC investigation and global criticism continued. \"IPC reports, widely cited as evidence against Israel, failed to mention Hamas\u2019 role in manipulating aid,\" Troen said.",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital whether the new findings would be considered in its investigation, the ICC Office of the Prosecutor responded: \"The ICC Office of the Prosecutor has a current and ongoing investigation in relation to the Situation in the State of Palestine. The Office\u2019s investigations are built from a wide range of sources. They can encompass Article 15 communications, information from states, international partners, and civil society, publicly available sources of information, and the direct collection of evidence by the Office, including interviews with witnesses.",

However, the political climate made the review process unusually intense.\"",
      "\"This was one of the most rigorously reviewed studies I\u2019ve ever worked on,\" Endevelt added. \"We had five reviewers, far more than usual, and months of back-and-forth revisions to ensure absolute accuracy.\"",

      "Inflation climbed 0.2% from January to February, down from January's 0.4% monthly rate and beating expectations of 0.3%. The decline was led by a sharp decrease in airfares, which fell 4%, and new vehicle prices, down a modest 0.1%.",

      "\u201cI thought, 'Yes, it\u2019s a small boulder, so I can just lift it up.' But oh my goodness, it was so heavy so I had to rethink this,\u201d Romilio told NBC News in a phone interview Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThey did not know that this was an actual fossil itself,\u201d said Romilio, a research associate at the University of Queensland\u2019s Dinosaur Lab and co-author of research published online Monday in the Historical Biology journal",
      "He went on to identify 66 fossilized footprints from 47 individual dinosaurs left during the early Jurassic period, nearly 200 million years ago.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge number of dinosaurs, and it\u2019s the highest number found in a single slab in Australia,\u201d he said.",
      "The school's deputy principal, David Hall, told the The Australian Broadcasting Corporation that Romilio's discoveries had been a shock, but also \"a bit exciting.\"",
      "\"It sits in a very public area in our student foyer and our kids walk past it every day, and so do we,\" he said.",
      "He added that the school had ended up with the boulder about 20 years ago when a geologist who was married to one of the school's teachers came across it in a nearby mine.",
      "\u201cThat area was going to be blasted or disturbed with the mining activities, and he saved that specimen and donated it to the school,\u201d Hall added, according to ABC.",
      "After seeing the remarkable rock at the school, Romilio decided to dig into the matter further, and drove to a nearby coal mine in Callide. There, another open-air secret confronted him.",
      "\u201cAs I am coming into the car park, there was this massive boulder with another massive dinosaur footprint that\u2019s just staring at you,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd just my jaw dropped,\" he said, and remembers thinking: \"This is incredible.\u201d",
      "The boulder at the mine contained two footprints, one that was obvious and another half broken and hidden with mud. Together with a third rock that is part of a private collection and encased in resin, researchers have been able to piece together an ancient history of the area.",
      "These records are a critical window into the Jurassic period in Australia, when \u201cthe most common dinosaur fossils are footprints, by several orders of magnitude,\u201d Romilio said.",
      "For now, the school boulder remains where it is, and discussions are underway for it to be relocated to a more public venue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a part of their community and really a part of their heritage,\u201d Romilio said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday that Democrats won't provide enough support to pass a government funding bill that Republicans wrote and passed through the House, leaving it uncertain whether Congress can avert a shutdown before Friday night's deadline.",
      "Schumer's comments come one day after the House narrowly approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through the end of September.",
      "\u201cFunding the government should be a bipartisan effort but Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input \u2014 any input \u2014 from congressional Democrats. Because of that, Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR,\u201d Schumer said on the floor, calling for a one-month funding bill that provides more time to negotiate a deal.",
      "\u201cOur caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" he said. \"\"I hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday.\"",
      "His remarks came after a lunch meeting between Democratic senators on Wednesday. They went in torn on whether to vote for the House's six-month measure, with some worried that a shutdown would be worse, even as they widely disapprove of the House bill.",
      "The government will shut down at the end of Friday, March 14, without a new funding law signed by President Donald Trump, who has endorsed the House legislation. Republicans control 53 Senate seats and need 60 votes to defeat a filibuster.",
      "\u201cThere are not the votes right now to pass it,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters after the meeting. \u201cDemocrats had nothing to do with this bill. And we want an opportunity to get an amendment vote or two. And so that\u2019s what we are insisting on.\u201d",
      "Still, some Democrats fear that a shutdown would be worse than accepting the bill, even though they didn't have input on crafting it.",
      "\u201cQuite frankly, both outcomes are bad,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cElections have consequences, but this is an extreme bill. If it passes, it will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground.\u00a0If the government shuts down, that will hurt a lot of ordinary people on the ground, and so that, that is the dilemma in which we found ourselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cAdditionally, the problem I have with the bill is that I think it advances this project that we\u2019re seeing come from the executive branch, this power grab that does not respect that the power of the purse is with the Congress,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the room where Democrats held their lunch meeting, reporters could hear senators loudly making their point to their colleagues inside, as the party attempted to solve for a problem with two outcomes they aren\u2019t interested in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m weighing the badness of each option,\u201d said Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., who didn\u2019t take a position on the bill.",
      "Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has said he will support the stopgap funding bill because it is preferable to a government shutdown.",
      "Many Senate Democrats said they want a one-month bill to finish work on a new appropriations agreement. Others said they disapprove of the House bill's boost to military spending and the cuts to nondefense domestic programs. And still others say they want guardrails on Trump's Elon Musk's powers to dismantle the government without congressional approval.",
      "Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., said Democrats \u201care unified in not wanting to shut down the government, and what we need to do is vote on the short-term\u201d bill for one month.",
      "But Republicans have little appetite for the one-month measure and are resigned to a continuing resolution through the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The White House has pressured the party to get this issue off their plate so their can focus on a multitrillion-dollar, Republican-only bill to advance Trump's legislative agenda on the border, taxes and other policy areas.",
      "The six-month government funding measure was passed by House Republicans on a nearly party-line vote of 217-213. And with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., as a firm no, at least eight Democrats will be needed to break a filibuster in the Senate.",
      "Some Democratic senators and aides worry that supporting the bill would set a bad precedent \u2014\u00a0they would effectively be telling House Republicans that they can write government funding measures without Democrats at the negotiating table.",
      "\"That's also one of the issues with what we're faced here,\" Kelly said.",
      "Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., slammed House Republicans for cutting Democrats out of the process on the bill.",
      "\"House Republicans right now have demonstrated that they don't care about working with anyone for the good of the American people,\" he said. \"They're going to continue marching along those lines.\"",

      "\u201cAt least for now, I don\u2019t see the votes. Based on my reading of the end of the meeting, I don\u2019t see the votes there right now for passing the House Republican\u201d bill Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he doesn't support a 30-day funding bill and wants to pass the House's six-month measure.",
      "\"I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll have a requisite number of Democrats in order to do that,\" he said Tuesday. \"And I think anything else they put out there is a smoke screen, because at this point, there\u2019s really one solution on the table that keeps the government funded.\"",
      "Republicans are betting that Democrats won't have the appetite to allow a shutdown despite their disagreements with the House bill.",
      "Lujan maintained that Democrats won\u2019t be responsible for a shutdown if the legislation falls short.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are in charge of the Senate, in charge of the House, and have the White House. The American people know who\u2019s in charge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous for Republicans to try to blame the party that\u2019s the minority everywhere.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, at their retreat in Leesburg, Va., House Democrats urged their Senate colleagues to block the bill. All but one, Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, voted against the funding bill on Tuesday.",
      "\"We\u2019re asking Senate Democrats to vote no on this continuing resolution, which is not clean, and it makes cuts across the board,\" Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., said. \"And it\u2019s going to be one of those things where people are going to look at this vote and every bad thing that now happens with Doge and Donald Trump, Elon Musk, you can go back to this vote.

    "story": [
      "The math is tight for Thom Cheston. Standing inside the walk-in fridge that stores the beer to be shipped across the Washington, D.C., area, he runs through a few numbers.",
      "He says his business, Right Proper Brewing, has to sell more than $6,000 of beer just to cover the taxes on his brewery. He\u2019s hesitant to raise prices because his competitors, most notably the big breweries, might not. And so having to pay more for the aluminum cans that ship his brews is a scary proposition.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum took effect Wednesday, and one of the places Americans touch aluminum most directly is in canned drinks.\u00a0This increase in the price of canning material could dramatically hit the bottom line of many businesses, such as craft breweries.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t raise our prices just because our costs have gone up,\u201d Cheston said. \u201cWe may be on the shelf next to breweries that are much larger than us, that may be in a better position to absorb those costs, whereas we are not.\u201d",
      "Cheston, like many small-business owners across the U.S., faces the prospects of rising costs in crucial pieces of the operations due to the escalating trade war that Trump has started with many of the U.S.\u2019 biggest trading partners.",
      "\u201cIt could be massive,\u201d Cheston, who co-founded Right Proper Brewing in 2013 as a neighborhood brewpub in Washington, D.C., said. The company has two locations and plans to open a third.",
      "While bottles are still an option, craft brewers have been shifting to cans for many years. For Cheston, the tariffs could mean the difference between being able to hire an additional employee or being able to buy necessary equipment.",
      "Cheston said that even 50 cents makes a difference when customers are choosing a beer off a grocery shelf.",
      "\u201cRoughly, if we were to incur a 25% increase in that cost, it would be over $40,000 for us, which is the cost of an employee,\u201d he said of the tariffs. Right Proper\u2019s packaging is provided by a third party that sources their aluminum in Canada.",
      "\u201cWhat we pay per piece is subject to the aluminum index, and so if that goes up, we pay more,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cWe have a few months of cans and inventory right now, but beyond that, there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d",
      "Cheston is competing for shelf space with other small craft breweries as well as larger companies, such as Molson Coors and Anheuser-Busch. Molson Coors has the ability to source its cans domestically and would not be affected by the tariffs.",
      "\u201cWhile we continue to evaluate the implications of possible tariffs, with respect to aluminum, we source our cans from a number of domestic suppliers, so our exposure to any tariffs on imported aluminum to the U.S. would be minimal,\u201d a company spokesperson told NBC News.",

      "BALTIMORE \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland suggested Wednesday that he might direct that thousands of fired federal workers get their jobs back, at least temporarily, after hearing arguments that their layoffs were unlawful.",
      "\"This case isn't about whether or not the government can terminate people. It\u2019s about if they decide to terminate people, how they must do it,\" U.S. District Judge James Bredar said at the hearing on the abrupt firings of thousands of probationary employees. The government has let go roughly 200,000 probationary employees \u2014 workers who are either recent hires or had taken new positions.",
      "\u201cMove fast and break things,\u201d Bredar, referring to a seminal quote from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg that has been used to describe Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. \u201cMove fast, fine. Break things? If that involves breaking the law, then that becomes problematic,\u201d the judge said.",
      "A coalition of states with Democratic attorneys general urged Bredar to sign a temporary restraining order that would restore the status quo from before the firings, which they maintain were illegal \u2014 meaning the fired workers would get their jobs back. The states argue the move is necessary because the government ignored proper procedure for the mass termination of federal employees, known as a \u201creduction in force.\u201d",
      "Under a RIF, \"agencies are required to provide advance notice to affected employees and, in circumstances relevant here, to states and local governments. An employee 'may not be released' as part of a RIF 'unless' they receive 60 days\u2019 'written notice' that provides information on reemployment and career transition assistance,\" among other requirements, the states contended in a court filing.",
      "The lack of notice has left the states scrambling to help the affected employees, said Virginia Williamson, speaking on behalf of the 21 states.",
      "\u2018The states have to act now, because people are suddenly unemployed now,\u201d Williamson said.",
      "The government's lawyer, Eric Hamilton, denied the firings were a RIF.",
      "\"It was a termination of probationary employees,\" Hamilton said.",
      "The judge asked him how many had been fired, and Hamilton said he could not give him a number. Asked if it was more than 100, Hamilton said, \"I would imagine so.\" Asked if it was over 1,000, he said he didn't know.",
      "\"Does anyone in the government know?\" the judge pressed.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Hamilton replied.",
      "In a court filing last week, the plaintiffs estimated that at least 24,000 probationary employees had already been fired \"and that more terminations are expected any day.\"",
      "Hamilton urged the judge to reject the states' request for a temporary restraining order, arguing they didn't have legal standing to bring a claim. \"This is not the sort of dispute designed for federal courts,\" Hamilton said, noting that courts refused to take action in two similar cases brought by the workers' unions.",
      "The judge repeatedly expressed skepticism that the firings were not a RIF, and said he would issue a written ruling \"promptly.\"",
      "In a related ruling late last month, a federal judge in California found that instructions from the Office of Personnel Management to fire the probationary workers were \"illegal\" and should be rescinded, but did not order the reinstatement of the dismissed employees. The instructions were officially rescinded last week.",
      "The government has also argued that affected employees can take their wrongful firing claims to the Merit Systems Protection Board.",
      "Last week, that federal civil service board found that the firing of over 5,000 probationary employees from the Department of Agriculture may have been unlawful and directed that the employees be restored to their jobs for at least 45 days.",
      "Following the initial firings of probationary workers, the administration late last month also informed agencies to prepare for \u201clarge-scale reductions in force\u201d of the rest of the federal workforce. \u00a0The Education Department announced Tuesday it plans to cut about half of its staff.",

      "A recent report from Cerulli Associates puts the total tally being passed to family members by 2048 at an estimated\u00a0$124 trillion.",
      "Whether husbands are\u00a0leaving money to their wives, or couples are passing a nest egg down to their children, \u201cwomen will receive most of it,\u201d said Kay\u00a0Hope, research analyst at Bank of America Global Research.",
      "Roughly $54 trillion will go to surviving spouses \u2014 a shift also referred to as the \u201chorizontal wealth transfer.\u201d Among this group, 95% are women, according to Bank of America Institute\u2019s recent\u00a0women and wealth\u00a0report.",
      "Another $47 trillion is expected to be passed down to women in younger generations as inherited wealth.",
      "\u201cThe result: women will soon control more money than ever before,\u201d the report said.",
      "Women\u2019s prosperity is on the rise",
      "Women have historically lagged in financial resources and opportunity, largely due to a persistent gender wage gap. Women today still\u00a0earn only 80%\u00a0of what their male counterparts do.",
      "However, women are achieving\u00a0increasing levels of education\u00a0and working as much, if not more, than their male counterparts, which has resulted in rising wages and greater representation in senior leadership positions.",
      "\u201cIncreased wage gains, coupled with the \u2018great wealth transfer,\u2019 position women to be key drivers of economic growth,\u201d Bank of America Institute\u2019s report said. And, \u201cas wealth increases, women\u2019s prosperity will help to \u2018grow the pie\u2019 of total affluence.\u201d",
      "By 2030, roughly two-thirds of the private wealth in the U.S. will be held by women \u2014 which will be the largest wealth transfer by gender in history, according to a separate research report by\u00a0McKinsey.",
      "For that reason, the money that is being passed down can create a safety net that didn\u2019t previously exist for women, according to\u00a0Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t bank on it 100%, but that can ease the pressure,\u201d said McClanahan, who also is a member of\u00a0CNBC\u2019s Advisor Council.",
      "How to navigate the wealth transfer",
      "There are a few key considerations to help women better prepare for the greatest generational wealth transfer in history, according to Christa O\u2019Brien, a financial advisor at Northwestern Mutual.",
      "Have the conversation:\u00a0\u201cMany often forget to consider the downsides that are associated with wealth transfers if they don\u2019t have a plan in place,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. For example, if the individual who passed did not have life insurance, long-term care or supplemental disability insurance, there may also be debts left behind that can erode the inheritance.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to plan early and make sure all beneficiaries are part of financial planning conversations with trusted advisors,\u201d she said.",
      "Where you live matters:\u00a0\u201cWhether it\u2019s an inherited 401(k), a life insurance payout or liquid assets transferring to your name, there are implications on how much you should take out, and when,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. Everyone\u2019s situation and the way they plan is different, she said, but the common goal is to lessen the future tax liability and spare your own heirs much larger bills.",
      "Plan for longevity:\u00a0Women live almost six years longer than men, on average,\u00a0and given longer life expectancies, women should consider strategies that ensure their savings last longer,\u00a0such as delaying Social Security benefits\u00a0to increase monthly payouts.",
      "That makes it even more important to start working with a financial advisor on a long-term investment strategy as well as buying long-term care insurance for yourself, O\u2019Brien said. By doing so, \u201cwhen the next wealth transfer takes place, you\u2019re setting that beneficiary up for greater financial success,\u201d she said.",
      "Build financial security:\u00a0Not only do women have smaller nest eggs than men, but they also tend to\u00a0invest more conservatively. Think about ways you may be able to grow cash or assets through options like a\u00a0high-yield savings\u00a0account,\u00a0Roth individual retirement account\u00a0or money market account, O\u2019Brien said, depending on your time frame.",
      "\u201cAs important as it is to invest to grow your money, consider being a little more aggressive with money you don\u2019t need right now and less aggressive with money you might need,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "Be aware of financial scams:\u00a0Financial scams are\u00a0a grave and growing threat\u00a0to consumers\u2019 financial security, and more often older adults and\u00a0women are targeted. For them, the financial blow\u00a0can be especially devastating.",

      "Moore's most recent book, \"The God of the Woods,\" came out last summer. Both made it into Barack Obama's annual round-ups of recommended reading. She also co-wrote the adaptation of \"Long Bright River\" along with showrunner Nikki Toscano.",
      "Moore spoke to TODAY.com ahead of the show's release about what fans of the book can expect.",
      "Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, TODAY's parent company.",
      "There's an element of bringing awareness to what it is to be somebody in active addiction, to be somebody in recovery or to be the family member of somebody who struggles with substance use disorder. What this does is bring a light specifically \u2014 it's a love story between sisters.",
      "I'm very happy it's set in Philadelphia, where I've lived for 16 years, and we were able to do local casting to bring actors from Philly, and non-actors from Philly, on set to play large and small roles.",
      "I think they're fundamentally different shows. I think we offer a look at actual Philadelphia. It's a very urban show. It also examines a pretty marginalized and underserved community. I hope it offers a pretty nuanced vision of the city of Philadelphia and runs counter to the negative media that the city and neighborhood have received in the past.",
      "I've corresponded with a lot of readers since the book was published in 2020, and they\u2019ve shared really, really moving things with me. I\u2019ve heard from people in recovery from addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have lost loved ones to addiction. I\u2019ve heard from family members who have are happily sharing a story of a loved one who who\u2019s in recovery as well. And I think that was really important to us in \"Long Bright River,\" to portray \"Long Bright River\" as something from which it is possible to recover \u2014 and telling a good, propulsive mystery at the same time.",
      "I think it was important to all of us who wrote on the series to tell a really good story and to prioritize good storytelling, rather than writing like to a particular set of themes. Because I think when you're writing to a theme or two themes, sometimes your characters can end up feeling kind of like weighed down by that.",
      "Character first, place first, story first \u2014 everything else is a byproduct of that.",
      "For viewers who have read the book, I think the heart of the book is very much still in the series \u2014 but I think they may possibly also be surprised by certain departures, hopefully in a good way.",
      "We changed one major character (Ed. note: G, Mickey's grandfather in the show) from a woman in the book to a man in the show, partly because we thought it would be fun to incorporate Mummer culture. It\u2019s a very big part of Philly culture. The mummers are groups of musicians and performers and who dress up and form parade units on New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "As far as I know this, it hasn\u2019t really been portrayed much in pop culture.",
      "No, I never do. I never outline. I know a very limited amount of information when I begin a novel, and it's where the novel is set, who the main character characters are and what the initial problem is that they have to solve \u2014 but I don't know the answer to the problem.",
      "So in the case of \"Long Bright River,\" I did not know who was responsible for the deaths of the the victims, I did not know where Mickey's sister had gone and I did not know whether there would be a connection between those two things."

      "In the popular videos, two people re-create the scene from \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\" when Will walks in on Ashley jamming to music on her Walkman.

      "The videos have garnered so much attention that Will Smith shared the original clip from the show on TikTok, but set Doechii\u2019s much newer \u201cAnxiety.\u201d",

      "Reacting to her song and the dance going viral, Doechii also hopped on TikTok to clear up how the song came to be.",
      "Doechii explained that \u201cyears ago,\u201d she recorded a remix of \u201cSomebody That I Used to Know\u201d and titled the track \u201cAnxiety.\u201d Then, in 2023, rapper Sleepy Hallow sampled her song on his track also called \u201cAnxiety.\u201d",
      "Now that the sound has surged in popularity, Doechii said she went back into the studio so she could release her own version. The track dropped on March 5 and has more than 22 million streams on Spotify.",
      "On TikTok, more than 725,000 videos have been posted using the song, with many incorporating the dance from \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\"",

      "\"Felt anxious, might delete later\u2026\" Lovato captioned her TikTok as she danced with a pal.",
      "Influencer Bretman Rock also did a take on the trend involving a slew of chickens instead of a singular dance partner.",
      "\"Me and the girlies,\" Rock wrote in the caption of the post, which garnered more than 4 million likes.",
      "The benefits of 'Anxiety' dance trend",
      "Certain anxiety disorders can cause intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations, and they can also involve panic attacks or repeated, sudden episodes of fear or terror that peak within minutes, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Feliciano explains research shows that creative expression can help overcome anxious thoughts and feelings, so she loves that the dance was paired with \"Anxiety.\"",
      "\"Dancing gives our brain another focus and requires multiple regions of the brain to perform,\" she says. \"It is nearly impossible feel anxiety when we do things like dance, sing or anything creative, which requires many physiological processes.\"",
      "A 2021 study from UCLA Health that found conscious dance produced mental health benefits among the vast majority of participants with depression, anxiety or history of trauma.",
      "\"We also know dancing, like other physical exercise, releases mood elevating hormones, such as serotonin\u00a0and endorphins,\" Feliciano says.",
      "So if you've been wanting to give the \"Anxiety\" TikTok dance a try, it's not just only fun \u2014 you may feel better afterward, too."

    "summary": "\"Temptation Island\" is back on Netflix. Which couples stayed together and which couples split up as of the finale? Find out here.",
    "story": [
      "It has been nearly two years since the last season of \u201cTemptation Island\u201d aired, and the reality television show\u2019s return on Netflix did not underwhelm.",
      "\u201cTemptation Island\u201d originally aired on Fox from 2001 to 2003 before it was revived and relocated to USA Network from 2019 to 2023. Then, the reality show took a hiatus for a few years before returning on a new platform: Netflix.",
      "On March 12, the streamer released all 10 episodes of its first season of \u201cTemptation Island,\u201d featuring some of the same elements from the past and a few new twists, like a secret camera-free tent.",
      "In the premiere, host Mark L. Walberg, who has helmed the series since it debuted more than 20 years ago, introduced viewers to the four couples who signed up for the wild experiment: Shant\u00e9 Glover and Brion Whitley, Ashley Moore and Grant Larsen, Alexa Santamaria and Lino Troisi and Tayler Byrd and Tyler Breshears.",
      "Each couple arrived on the island hoping to find answers to questions that have stalled their relationships. After explaining their problems to Walberg, they were introduced to all the tempters with whom they would live for the next few weeks. The couples then split and moved into separate villas with the tempters and temptresses, where they went on dates and tried to find the clarity they were searching for in their original pairing.",
      "Although the couples did not interact, they saw brief clips every few episodes of what their partners had been up to, which revealed some unfaithful moments and hard truths. Through it all, Walberg encouraged the contestants to tackle their feelings.",
      "During the final bonfire in the finale, all four couples reunited and confronted each other about everything that unfolded, including a threesome and more heartbreaking betrayals. As Walberg explained in the episode, each contestant was then given three options: leave with their original partner, leave with someone new or leave alone.",
      "Read on for a recap of the last episode and find out which couples survived \u201cTemptation Island.\u201d",
      "Brion and Shant\u00e9",
      "The first couple to reunite was Brion and Shant\u00e9. While Shant\u00e9 spent most of the experiment reserved and developing strictly platonic connections with the men at her villa, Brion decided to explore his sexual fantasies. He had a threesome with tempters Courtney Randolph and Alex Zamora. Brion repeatedly expressed that he didn\u2019t have any regrets and that was confident Shant\u00e9 would forgive him. When Shant\u00e9 watched the footage of Brion cheating on her at the bonfire, she remained stoic, though the other women called him out for being disrespectful.",
      "When the two met at the final bonfire, Brion immediately grabbed Shant\u00e9\u2019s hands and pulled her into an embrace. He apologized and sobbed. Walberg explained that they each would be able to speak their minds, uninterrupted, before having a conversation where they could ask all the questions they needed to.",
      "Shant\u00e9 went first, recalling that Brion brought her on the show because he wanted to prove he could have platonic relationships with women. She said his actions made her feel worthless and that their love never mattered to him. She added that he didn\u2019t behave like a man who deserves her and that she also saw clips of him disrespecting the women in his villa.",
      "Brion repeatedly apologized and told Shant\u00e9 he loved her. He said that the man he was before the experiment was \u201cfake\u201d and a \u201csurface-level boyfriend.\u201d He said he wanted to show her he had changed and was ready to be the boyfriend, future husband and father she deserved.",
      "What did they decide? Brion announced his decision first. He said wanted to leave with Shant\u00e9 and build back her trust. After stepping away for a moment and being consoled by a producer, Shant\u00e9 returned to share her decision. She said she wanted to respect herself and potentially see this new version of him, but she had to choose herself for now.",
      "While Brion said he understood, he added that he would\u2019ve never crossed their boundaries in real life. Shant\u00e9 then changed her mind and decided to leave with Brion.",
      "She explained her change of heart, telling the cameras, \u201cI believe in our love. I think that we can make this something special. And I am happy with my decision.\u201d",
      "Tyler and Tayler",
      "Tyler signed up for \u201cTemptation Island\u201d because he wanted to prove to Tayler that she could trust him. But during his time on the show, Tyler quickly developed a connection with cast member Kay Carlson. The two shared kisses and multiple intimate moments.",
      "Tayler arrived at the final bonfire first. When Tyler approached her, he asked for a hug. She shook her head, a glimpse of the icy interaction that followed. She pulled out a letter to share her thoughts on Tyler\u2019s behavior during the experiment. She said she felt \u201cplayed\u201d and that his actions were \u201churtful and extremely disrespectful\u201d to their relationship. Tayler spoke about her growth on the island and said Tyler wouldn\u2019t get to know the new version of her.",
      "Tyler mentioned the bonfire clips he saw that hurt him, particularly a video of Tayler saying he had \u201cb---- tendencies.\u201d He said he felt \u201cclowned\u201d listening to her description and said that she took advantage of his insecurities. He also acknowledged his relationship with Kay, saying that she tempted him and opened his mind to new ideas.",
      "Tayler pointed out it only took 72 hours for him to forget about her. He countered that it was because he realized he could never be the man she hoped he would become.",
      "What did they decide? After tearfully telling Tyler that he was her \u201chome\u201d and \u201csafe place\u201d before they landed on the island, she said it was \u201cgutting\u201d seeing him fall in love with Kay. So, the rest of the experiment she focused on herself and said she realized she wanted to feel chosen. She said that she needed to choose herself and wanted to leave the island alone.",
      "Tyler said he knew their relationship was over and wanted to leave the island with Kay. Tayler wished him the best and walked away. In her final confessional, Tayler said she didn\u2019t feel like she lost anything because of the connections she built.",
      "Kay then joined Tyler, who gushed about her while pointing out their relationship was still in the honeymoon stage. He asked her to leave the island with him and Kay agreed. She told the cameras she was happy to learn that their connection on the island was genuine.",
      "Ashley and Grant",
      "Ashley and Grant, another couple who dealt with infidelity before coming on the show, also struggled during the experiment. Ashley watched clips at the bonfire of multiple sexual encounters between Grant and tempter Natalie Cruz.",
      "At the final bonfire, Ashley put her hand up and said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s OK,\u201d when Grant attempted to greet her with a hug. They glared at each other in silence before Walberg asked Grant to speak first.",
      "Grant said that he had \u201cenjoyed chasing\u201d Ashley for most of their relationship but he couldn\u2019t do it anymore because she was \u201cunobtainable.\u201d He expressed his love for her and lamented hurting her. But he said that he felt disrespected and belittled in their relationship.",
      "Ashley began by saying she didn\u2019t have a lot she wanted to talk about. She said she wished Grant had been honest with her before they came on the show and admitted he didn\u2019t have the ability to stay loyal to her. She mentioned that it only took a few days for Grant to cheat on her. \u201cYou\u2019re a serial cheater,\u201d she told him.",
      "He said he went through an emotional rollercoaster as he tried to figure out why their relationship didn\u2019t work. He revealed he had been \u201cforcing\u201d their connection for a long time and that he should\u2019ve called it quits.",
      "What did they decide? Despite his budding connection with Natalie, Grant announced that he wanted to leave the island alone. Ashley said she wanted to depart with her new connection, tempter Danny Spongberg. As Grant cried, she told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting and I\u2019m sorry that we got to this place. I wanted you to be a good man for me and it just wasn\u2019t working.\u201d",
      "They hugged before Grant left. He told the cameras that he liked Natalie but he needed to take time to figure out how to be alone.",
      "Danny entered and Ashley told him she wanted to pursue their connection. He said he wanted to leave with her, too, and they kissed. She praised him for helping bring out a light within her that she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.",
      "Alexa and Lino",
      "Alexa and Lino were the only couple to remain faithful throughout the experiment despite the trust issues they revealed in Episode 1. When they first started dating, Alexa was seeing other people even though she told Lino they were exclusive. Throughout their relationship, Lino felt like he was a second option, causing tension between them.",
      "As soon as Alexa saw Lino at the final bonfire, she became emotional. They kissed and repeatedly expressed how much they loved and missed each other. Alexa told him that she grew more on the island than she could\u2019ve ever imagined. She said she felt \u201cempty\u201d when they arrived and she thought that was because she was co-dependent in their relationship. But she realized that she is independent and she felt empty because their connection is so special.",
      "She added that she appreciated him, but he could not continue to hold her past decisions over her head.",
      "Lino\u2019s response was concise. He said he thought the show would be a wild and insightful journey but it ended up being \u201carduous.\u201d He learned that he projected his insecurities onto her and apologized. Going forward, he wanted to provide the emotional support she needed and\u00a0said he would leave his trust issues on the island.",
      "What did they decide? Alexa and Lino revealed they wanted to leave together. She told him, \u201cI want to leave with you, the love of my life. There\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather choose.\u201d",
      "He replied, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person on the earth that I would leave this island with. You\u2019re the love of my life and the light of my life.\u201d",
      "Walberg congratulated them and the two left, hand in hand. They rounded the corner and saw a path of flowers and candles. Lino took Alexa\u2019s hands and said, \u201cFrom the first moment I saw you all those years ago, I knew you\u2019d be mine.\u201d He gushed that she was the most beautiful and kind woman he had ever known. He promised to cherish her before kneeling to one knee and proposing.",
      "She covered her face and happily said yes. The two popped champagne and toasted before he thanked \u201cTemptation Island\u201d for helping him gain a fianc\u00e9e."

      "\u201cGrowing up, a lot of people at church would talk about these experiences that they\u2019ve had and these personal revelations and feelings and voices. I never felt it as physically present as they did, and so I was always confused and frustrated,\u201d he told the magazine in a new interview released March 11. \u201cI was always scared to bring that up to people because I just didn\u2019t want to accept that, like, I wasn\u2019t feeling what everyone else was feeling.\u201d",
      "When he shared his thoughts with his friend, they replied, \u201cThank goodness. I feel the same way.\u201d",

      "\u201c\u200aI don\u2019t want to be a part of one religion. I have my own opinions. Some are from this religion, some are from this religion, some are from no religion,\u201d he explained.",
      "He added that his decision to step back from his childhood faith hasn't been an issue with his parents.",
      "\u201c\u200aMy parents definitely have their own views, but when it comes to religion and God, they want me to figure it out on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whatever I come to, and whatever I feel is right, that\u2019s what they want for me.\u201d",
      "And while he doesn\u2019t consider himself Mormon, he told the magazine that he still abstains from alcohol and drugs. He has, however, had coffee, which is forbidden in the religion, but doesn\u2019t enjoy it.",
      "\u201c\u200aThere was a period of time where I really wanted to like coffee and (would) go out to this place in L.A. with (my girlfriend) Maggie (Thurmon),\u201d he shared. \u201cAnd I would try sips of her coffee every day and it literally tastes like burnt wood.\u201d",
      "But part of his own journey is also deciding for himself to stay away from any addictive substance because of his personality and health.",
      "\u201c\u200aI just think for me personally, like, dude, I would die,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Cause I have such an addictive personality. I feel like if I started, I would do it so much that my health would just decline and I wouldn\u2019t enjoy touring as much.\u201d",
      "And when it comes to making decisions outside of his former religion, the Grammy-nominated artist said he considers his biggest weakness to be his biggest strength, which is, \u201cWhen I convince my brain of something, I have to do it. There\u2019s no backing out or stepping down.\u201d",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Boone attended Brigham Young University, a private Mormon university, for a semester before dropping out to pursue a music career.",
      "He would go on to audition for Season 19 of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d making it to the top 24 \u2014 before also exiting the show. At the time, Boone felt that the show would hold him back than help him have a real music career.",
      "The singer appears to have made a great move with the release of \u201cBeautiful Things,\u201d which would go on to become the most-streamed track in the world in 2024, according to Rolling Stone."

      "He was a basketball star at Princeton",
      "Robinson attended Princeton University and made a name for himself on the Princeton Tigers basketball team. In fact, the two-time Ivy League Player of the Year (1981-1982 and 1982-1983), still ranks as the seventh highest scorer in in the team\u2019s history with 1,441 points accrued over the course of his NCAA career.",
      "After graduation, Robinson went pro \u2014 but not in the U.S. Despite being picked by the Philadelphia 76ers in the fourth round of the 1983 NBA draft, he went on to sign with U.K. pros the Manchester Giants.",

      "After his two-season tenure with the Manchester Giants, Robinson returned to the U.S. and briefly gave coaching a go before leaving the court behind and getting his M.B.A. in 1992.",

      "In 2000, he returned to coaching when he took on an assistant\u2019s job at Northwestern, which, according to the New York Times, left him earning just a tenth of his salary from his bond trading days. A swap he considered worth it.",

The other worry was that he might turn out to be one of those jerks who is oblivious to everyone else on the floor but himself. Almost as soon as we started playing, it was clear that I didn\u2019t have to worry about his competence.\u201d",

      "In the film, Clooney played news producer Fred Friendly, but this time, he\u2019s playing the lead.",

      "The \"Ides of March\" actor previously shared his thoughts on embracing age in a 2015 interview with BBC\u2019s Radio 4. Clooney said the best thing that someone can do as they get older is just \u201ccome to terms\u201d with how their appearance changes and not try to fight it.",
      "When asked if he had ever considered dying his hair at that point, he answered, \"No, clearly I haven't. Clearly it's never been an issue or an option, I don't think it would make much sense.\"",

      "A few months later, Silikovitz was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease, a brain disorder that causes unintended and uncontrollable movements, according to the\u00a0National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cBut I refused to let that diagnosis deter me from following my long-held dream,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked hard to manage my Parkinson\u2019s symptoms \u2014 even while relentlessly seeking to improve my knowledge base as well as my proficiency at the skills, such as timing on the buzzer, that are crucial to success on J!\u201d",
      "And in late January 2025, his dream came true when he flew out to Culver City, California, to film the episode that would air on March 10.",

Or did the third player take down both of us? Tune in on Monday to find out!\u201d",
      "And as TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager said, Silikovitz didn\u2019t just compete \u2014 he won \u201cin a big way,\u201d she said on TODAY\u2019s Morning Boost on March 11.",

      "Greer said she spoke by phone with one of the ICE agents during the arrest, who said they were acting on State Department orders to revoke Khalil\u2019s student visa. Informed by the attorney that Khalil was in the United States as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that too, according to the lawyer.",
      "The arrest appears to be among the first known actions under President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to deport international students who joined the protests against the war in Gaza that swept college campuses last spring. His administration has claimed participants forfeited their rights to remain in the country by supporting Hamas, a terror organization.",
      "When ICE agents arrived at the campus building Saturday, they also threatened to arrest Khalil\u2019s wife, an American citizen who is eight months pregnant, Greer said. The authorities declined to say why Khalil was being arrested, according to the attorney.",
      "They were initially told he was transferred to an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. But when Khalil\u2019s wife tried to visit Sunday, she learned he was not there \u2014 and may have been transferred as far away as Louisiana, Greer said.",
      "\u201cWe have not been able to get any more details about why he is being detained,\u201d Greer told the AP. \u201cThis is a clear escalation. The administration is following through on its threats.\u201d",

      "Messages seeking comment were left Sunday with the State Department and ICE.",
      "In a\u00a0message\u00a0shared on X Sunday evening, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration \u201cwill be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d",
      "DHS can initiate deportation proceedings against green card holders for a broad range alleged criminal activity, including supporting a terror group. It would ultimately be up to an immigration judge to revoke someone\u2019s permanent resident status, according to Camille Mackler, founder of Immigrant ARC, a coalition of legal service providers in New York.",
      "\u201cThis has the appearance of a retaliatory action against someone who expressed an opinion the Trump administration didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mackler said.",
      "Khalil served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring, a role that made him one of the most visible activists in support of the movement.",

      "The university\u2019s allegations against Khalil focused on his involvement in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group. He faced sanctions for potentially helping to organize an \u201cunauthorized marching event\u201d in which participants glorified Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and playing a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the circulation of social media posts criticizing Zionism, among other acts of alleged discrimination.",

      "More than 1,300 people have been killed in 72 hours, according to the organization, including security force members and militants.",
      "It is unclear which groups are involved in the killing of civilians, with reports of different militias converging in the area, and much remains unknown about what is unfolding in Syria. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa called for peace Sunday, amid reports of executions, firing squads and bodies piled in the streets.",
      "Clashes between Syrian government forces and fighters loyal to the deposed dictator, Bashar al-Assad, have also led to hundreds more deaths on both sides.",
      "The violence has been concentrated in the coastal areas of Tartus and Latakia, the home of the Alawite community, a small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. According to the SOHR, the vast majority of the civilian dead appear to be Alawites, which NBC News has not independently confirmed.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d for the killings and urged Syria\u2019s leadership to hold them accountable.",

      "What we know",
      "Syria\u2019s rugged Mediterranean shore was a stronghold of the Assad family\u2019s brutal regime, which lasted 53 years before a rebel alliance led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ousted Assad three months ago in a lightning-fast offensive that swept across the nation and led HTS leader Sharaa to become the new government\u2019s interim president.",
      "However, Syria\u2019s northwest coast remains a fractured battleground, with armed Assad loyalists holding on to villages and remote pockets of territory.",
      "Sharaa\u2019s government has deployed armed forces to the region in a bid to assert control, but fierce clashes erupted last week that have left hundreds dead.",
      "Video posted on social media and verified by NBC News showed dozens of bodies piled on a blood-soaked street in Latakia. Women gathered around the bloodied corpses. One can be heard sobbing, \u201cMy dad, my brother, oh, God.\u201d",
      "Other verified videos showed military vehicles moving through the countryside amid explosions and gunfire, while another showed soldiers indiscriminately dropping bombs from a helicopter over Latakia\u2019s rural areas.",
      "The SOHR\u00a0is a prominent information office dedicated to documenting human rights abuses in Syria.",
      "The group said that the vast majority of people killed in the current clashes were from the Alawite sect and that women and children were executed by firing squad in the countryside near Tartus.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the death toll or methods of execution.",
      "The Associated Press reported that Sunni gunmen, perhaps loyal to the government, initiated revenge killings Friday, with residents saying that Alawites were being killed in the streets or at the gates of their homes and that their houses were looted and set on fire.",
      "SOHR also reported that 125 government security forces and 148 militants from Assad-affiliated armed groups were among the dead.",
      "Federico Jachetti,\u00a0Syria country office director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0the escalation is \u201ca grim reminder that the situation in the country remains fragile\u201d and cited reports of \u201csummary killings, widespread displacement and thousands more left trapped in their homes.\u201d",
      "\u201cSyrian families across the country are yearning for a respite after long years of uncertainty and fear,\u201d he said, calling on all parties to protect civilians.",
      "Who are the Alawites?",
      "The once-ruling minority is a tight-knit Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs. Under Assad, Alawites were appointed to key positions in the military and security forces, positioning them as the elite within Syria\u2019s state bureaucracy and security apparatus.",
      "The rise of HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate with an extremist past, raised deep concerns among the Alawite community as it took power.",
      "Sunni dominance has inflicted deep scars on the region, and minorities like the Alawites, as well as Christians, Druze and Yazidis, all have reasons to fear the rise of extremist governance.",
      "Sharaa had tried to quell such fears, telling CNN in December, \u201cNo one has the right to erase another group.\u201d",
      "But the recent surge in violence suggests a different story, challenging Sharaa\u2019s claim that his interim government would protect all groups and foster stability.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, urged\u00a0Syria's leadership to take \u201cswift actions to protect\u00a0Syrians, including by taking all necessary measures to prevent\u00a0any violations and abuses.\u201d",
      "What does this mean for Syria?",
      "Unifying Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups has been one of the major challenges of a post-Assad Syria. A significant escalation of violence could threaten the country\u2019s fragile stability and at worst threaten to tip the country back into civil war should the interim government lose control of some areas.",
      "Sharaa has actively sought to rebrand himself as a unifier willing to put down his previous extremist affiliations. For a time, this strategy appeared successful, generating a surge of goodwill and optimism.",
      "In February, a video surfaced showing Sharaa waving from the sunroof of a black vehicle, surrounded by a jubilant crowd during his first visit to Latakia, where he appeared receive a hero\u2019s welcome.",
      "Internationally, the explosion of violence may derail the progress Sharaa has made in reassuring Western leaders that he can ferry in a Syria free of threats."

      "But in recent elections, Alice Weidel took the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party from the fringes to the heart of power. Championed by Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, Weidel is part of a growing group of powerful women leading Europe\u2019s ascendant far-right parties, alongside Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen.",
      "With party co-chair Tino Chrupalla, Weidel led the AfD to second place in Germany\u2019s election last month, a triumph for a party being monitored by the country\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",
      "\u201cNobody has done this in Europe in such a short time,\u201d a beaming Weidel said at a news conference after her party secured just over 20% of the vote, doubling its share from 2021. Noting that she had missed several calls from Musk that morning, she added that her party \u201cespecially want a very good, a very good relationship with the Trump administration, who are doing an excellent job.\u201d",
      "Weidel, who has previously praised the importance of children being raised in a traditional, nuclear family and has said that legalizing same-sex marriage is unimportant, nonetheless raises her two sons with her Sri Lankan-born female partner of 20 years, Sarah Bossard, in Willerzell, a sleepy village in the heart of Switzerland with around 1,000 residents. (Officially, she is registered as a resident of \u00dcberlingen, in Germany, just over the border from Switzerland.)",
      "The AfD has opposed gay marriage and the expansion of laws allowing same-sex couples to adopt, but Weidel has said her sexuality does not conflict with the AfD\u2019s traditional values, and analysts say the party\u2019s rank and file are prepared to overlook her family life as long as she brings them success.",
      "Before entering politics, Weidel was a consultant for Goldman Sachs and Allianz Global Investors, a slice of her background that appeals to those in the AfD who seek to appear both more moderate than its most anti-immigrant flank and more practical, though she has championed the AfD\u2019s populist economic platform of big tax cuts and steep increases in public spending."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 As President Donald Trump gave a fiery and divisive speech to a joint session of Congress last week, a much more staid political event was underway on the other side of the world.",
      "The annual gathering of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s parliament, is tightly choreographed, with all decisions made in advance by the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Security is even tighter than usual around central Beijing and armies of volunteers wearing red armbands are stationed on street corners and at subway stations.",
      "Though there are few surprises and no debate, the weeklong National People\u2019s Congress does offer clues to China\u2019s priorities at home and how it plans to approach the world.",
      "Even as it faces a slowing economy, China appears to be making a strategic decision to present itself as a global stalwart amid a world in turmoil as Trump upends international trade and long-standing alliances, eroding U.S. prestige and creating an opportunity for China to fill the void.",
      "As if to underscore China\u2019s relative steadfastness,\u00a0Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi rarely gestured or moved his hands at his annual news conference on Friday.\u00a0He used the word \u201cstability\u201d at least 14 times during 90 minutes in front of reporters, according to Chinese transcripts.",
      "Some of his sharpest language was directed at the Trump administration, which last week doubled tariffs on Chinese imports to 20% and said there could be more to come.",
      "\u201cNo country should expect to suppress and contain China on one hand while developing good relations with China on the other,\u201d Wang said, slamming what he called a \u201ctwo-faced approach.\u201d",
      "China has long complained about U.S. tariffs, which in the first Trump administration set off a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. But at least outwardly, China doesn\u2019t appear overly concerned about the impact of the new tariffs or in a rush to placate Trump to stave off more.",
      "\u201cNobody worries about it,\u201d tech executive Yao Lijun told NBC News on Wednesday as he walked out of the Great Hall of the People, an ornate building next to Tiananmen Square in Beijing where some 3,000 Chinese leaders and lawmakers were gathered for the NPC.",
      "\u201cWe only focus on ourselves, how we can do much better,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe don\u2019t worry about others.\u201d",
      "China responded to the new tariff on Tuesday by announcing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some U.S. goods, mostly agricultural products, in a measured move similar to the levies it imposed when the first 10% tariff took effect last month.",
      "\u201cAppearing alarmed or alarmist is not something Beijing wants to communicate, because that\u2019s precisely what Trump is trying to elicit,\u201d said Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University in Shanghai.",
      "Though Wang avoided saying anything too provocative on Friday, earlier in the week Beijing called back to its more aggressive \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy of the past, with the Foreign Ministry saying, \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end.\u201d",
      "It was the harshest rhetoric from Beijing since Trump returned to office in January.",
      "The message from those comments is clear, said Wang Dong, a professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University in Beijing. China will resolutely defend its national interests, and any U.S. attempt to force it into submission \u201cwill backfire and fail,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina will use a \u2018tit for tat\u2019 strategy, meaning if the U.S. shifts to conflict, China will follow suit and retaliate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the U.S. reverts back to cooperation, China will do the same.\u201d",
      "Cooperation did not appear to be on Trump\u2019s mind on Tuesday as he told Congress he would impose reciprocal tariffs on \u201cfriend and foe\u201d starting April 2.",
      "His \u201cAmerica First\u201d speech sent the message that \u201cthe U.S. only cares about its own interests and will pursue them in a relentless and ruthless manner, without caring about international rules or norms,\u201d Wang, the professor, said in written comments.",
      "He noted that Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, both of which he touted in his address to Congress. Such moves signal the U.S. is no longer interested in upholding the liberal values and rules-based international order it has championed since the end of World War II, Prof. Wang said.",
      "\u201cBy contrast, China\u2019s message is it is willing to work with other stakeholders and the international community to tackle common global challenges such as climate change,\u201d he said.",
      "In keeping with the stability theme, Chinese officials announced the same target for economic growth as last year: 5%. Likewise, China\u2019s 2025 increase in defense spending is staying the same as last year at 7.2%.",
      "Delivering a government work report at the opening session on Wednesday, Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, did not mention Trump but noted rising unilateralism and protectionism around the world and indicated China would pursue the opposite.",
      "\u201cChina is ready to work with other members of the international community to promote an equal and orderly multipolar world,\u201d he said.",
      "Li acknowledged China\u2019s significant economic challenges, which include a persistent property crisis, high youth unemployment and sluggish consumer spending. And in a nod to U.S. tariffs and other measures, he said, \u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science and technology.\u201d",
      "\u201cRegardless of changes in the external environment, we should remain steadfast in our commitment to opening up,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe will continue to expand our globally oriented network of high-standard free trade areas.\u201d",
      "China is counting on its trade relationships with other countries to help its export-dependent economy withstand Trump\u2019s tariffs, the cost of which U.S. and other experts say will be almost entirely passed on to American consumers and importers.",
      "\u201cTo be frank, with this kind of tariff war, both countries suffer,\u201d said Zhang Weiwei, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai and the director of its China Institute.",
      "\u201cBut the U.S. will suffer more.\u201d",

      "Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly criticized LGBTQ people and pledged to crack down on foreign funding of independent media and nongovernmental organizations in Hungary in recent weeks, after his ally, U.S. President Donald Trump, paused funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "summary": "Researchers in Spain have discovered pieces of a fossilized face belonging to an ancient human ancestor. The fragments cannot be conclusively identified as any particular species.",
    "story": [
      "In a cave in northern Spain, researchers have discovered pieces of a fossilized face belonging to an ancient human ancestor \u2014\u00a0the oldest human fossil ever found in Western Europe.",
      "The remains, which the team nicknamed \u201cPink,\u201d are between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old. But they\u2019re mysterious: The facial fragments do not seem to come from any species found in the same area in the past, nor can they be conclusively identified as any particular species.",
      "\u201cWe are documenting a previously unknown human population in Europe,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Martin\u00f3n-Torres, a co-author of the study and a paleoanthropologist at the Spanish National Research Center for Human Evolution, said in a call with reporters. \u201cThis fossil represents the earliest human fossil found so far in Western Europe.\u201d",
      "The fragment, discovered in 2022, was first reported in the journal Nature on Wednesday with new details.",
      "The researchers tentatively suggested that Pink is likely related to the human ancestor Homo erectus. (The fossil was named, in part, for the band Pink Floyd, and also after Rosa Huguet, the study\u2019s primary author and the coordinator of the archaeological site where it was found.)",
      "The finding is significant because it gives researchers a better timeline of when Western Europe was first settled by human ancestors. It could also help bridge a gap in evolutionary space between the oldest known human ancestor fossils found in Europe \u2014 which are roughly 1.8 million years old and were discovered at a site in the Republic of Georgia called Dmanisi \u2014 and a species called Homo antecessor, which dates back roughly 900,000 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like the Dmanisi fossils, which are older, and it\u2019s not like the younger Homo sapien-like anatomy of Homo antecessor. It\u2019s something in between,\u201d said Rodrigo Lacruz, a professor of molecular pathobiology at New York University, who was not involved in the new discovery but has studied the evolution of the human face.",
      "The discovery may therefore help researchers better understand the story of early human evolution and migration in Europe.",
      "\u201cWe can start piecing together what that population could have looked like, and that\u2019s a great value, because you start seeing how anatomy changes over time,\u201d Lacruz said.",
      "The team that discovered Pink said the fossil is from an adult, but they are not sure whether male or female. Pink was found about 60 feet below the top layer of sedimentary rock, at a cave within the Sierra de Atapuerca archaeological site, which is known for the rich historical record in its rock layers.",
      "Within the same sedimentary level as Pink, researchers found stone tools and animal bones with marks made by cutting, which suggests that these early ancestors butchered animals for meat.",
      "Evidence suggests that human ancestors settled Europe in multiple waves, but that most of those populations subsequently contracted and died out. The fossil record is discontinuous at the Atapuerca site and in Western Europe as a whole, indicating that there were likely long periods without human presence.",
      "The study posits that the species Pink belonged to could have overlapped briefly with Homo antecessor. It\u2019s also possible the species was wiped out during a climactic shift that started about 1.1 million years ago and has only recently been identified by researchers.",
      "Chris Stringer, a professor and research leader on human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the discovery of Pink, said the climate event \u201cmay have caused a major and perhaps complete human depopulation of western Europe.\u201d",
      "The cave where Pink was discovered, called Sima del Elefante, or elephant chasm, has produced compelling fossils before. In 2007, researchers found a small piece of jawbone that is believed to be about 1.2 million years old, which appears to be closely related to Pink. Pink was found about 6 feet deeper than that fossil, though, which makes scientists believe it\u2019s older.",
      "Martin\u00f3n-Torres said the researchers were shocked to find a new, important fossil even deeper. Her first reaction to the discovery, she said, was: \u201cAm I really dreaming?\u201d",
      "The region\u2019s impressive collection of fossils likely has to do with its geography.",
      "\u201cAtapuerca was a natural corridor between different mountain systems,\u201d Martin\u00f3n-Torres said, adding that there was ample water. \u201cIt was probably a place that was ideal for hominins to settle. They have the resources, they have the animals passing by.\u201d",
      "Scientists are still digging at the archaeological site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep excavating,\u201d Martin\u00f3n-Torres said. \u201cWe may have more surprises.\u201d"

      "Her friends then spent that Thursday, March 6, on an excursion and realized she went missing roughly 12 hours later. They then informed the hotel, Dominican Republic National Police spokesperson Diego Pesqueira said.",
      "Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader said at a news conference Monday that one of the last people who had contact with Konanki reported \"that a wave hit them while they were on the beach and caused some kind of situation,\" citing local reports.",

      "Duterte, 79, could become the first Asian former head of state to go on trial at the ICC in The Hague.",

      "The 59-year-old man, who hasn\u2019t been named by authorities, was arrested by police in northeast England on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence over the collision. He hasn\u2019t been charged.",

      "The Vatican said Wednesday that Francis had a quiet night at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital.",
      "If the last few days are any guide, the 88-year-old Argentine will most likely follow the Vatican\u2019s spiritual retreat remotely while his physical and respiratory therapy continues. The pope\u2019s weekly Wednesday general audience was canceled anyway, since the entire Vatican hierarchy is on retreat this week as part of the Lenten spiritual exercises that have been a mainstay of the Jesuit pope\u2019s pontificate.",
      "Doctors have said Francis is making slow, gradual improvements and this week declared that he\u2019s no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of the complex respiratory infection he had when he was admitted on Feb. 14. But they remain cautious, given the complexity of his condition and overall fragility, and say he needs to remain hospitalized for an unspecified number of days.",
      "Another medical update was expected later Wednesday.",
      "Thursday marks the 12th anniversary of Francis\u2019 election as the 266th pope. The former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave that was called after Pope Benedict XVI resigned. While Francis has praised Benedict\u2019s humility in stepping down and said that he too might follow in his footsteps, more recently he has said that the papacy is a job for life.",
      "The Holy See hasn\u2019t said how the anniversary, which is a public holiday in the Vatican, might be commemorated this year.",
      "Another milestone comes Friday, when Francis marks four weeks or 28 days of hospitalization. St. John Paul II has the record for a hospital stay, at 55 days in 1981 when he underwent a minor surgical operation and was then treated for a cytomegalovirus infection. Francis is on track to equal the second-longest stay, 28 days, which John Paul recorded in 1994 when he had surgery to repair his right hip joint after he fractured his right femur in a fall, according to Gemelli hospital.",
      "The Vatican has released no photos or video of Francis since he was admitted. The pope recorded an audio message last week to thank people for their prayers, though the weakness and breathlessness of his voice made clear just how frail he was."
