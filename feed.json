      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "San Francisco (AP) \u2014 A Northern California aquarium has raised more than $2 million for sea otter conservation in just two days. All it took was Taylor Swift wearing a vintage T-shirt.",
      "Swift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium otter conservation T-shirt in a release party movie for her new \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d album, sending her ardent fans on a quest to buy the shirt last produced in the 1990s. After the aquarium was flooded with calls about buying the T-shirt showing two otters floating on their back, it decided to re-release the garment Thursday as part of a special campaign to raise $1.3 million, a nod to Swift\u2019s favorite number, said Liz MacDonald, the aquarium\u2019s director of content strategy.",
      "The aquarium met and surpassed its goal to raise the funds for its sea otter conservation program in less than eight hours, averaging about $100,000 in sales every 15 minutes, MacDonald said. Donors who give at least $65.13 to its newest fundraising campaign to help injured and orphan otters will be mailed a T-shirt, MacDonald said.",
      "\u201cWe definitely had a little Taylor Swift dance party in the office yesterday afternoon when we hit the goal,\u201d she said.",
      "The aquarium began accepting back-orders and by Friday afternoon it had raised more than $2 million, according to its website.",
      "How Swift acquired the T-Shirt that was last produced more than 32 years ago \u2014 when she was just 3 years old \u2014 remains a mystery.",
      "She and fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce have been documented visiting nearby Carmel, but MacDonald said the aquarium is not aware of the couple having been in their shop.",
      "MacDonald said the staff has had fun speculating about Swift's interest in the T-shirt.",
      "When Taylor announced the release of her new album on Kelce\u2019s podcast \"New Heights\" a couple of weeks ago, the couple had a little banter about how he loves otters and loves sending her videos of the furry sea creatures.",
      "\u201cOne of my favorite theories is that we have a sea otter on our exhibit whose name is Opal and she was named by the fans through an online poll, and I wonder if Taylor Swift may have been one of the people that voted for the name Opal,\u201d MacDonald said, adding that opal is Kelce\u2019s birthstone and that Opalite is the name of one of Swift\u2019s songs.",

I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",

      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement. At the \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.",
      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

      "Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke have collaborated for over 30 years, but their latest film, \"Blue Moon,\" pushed their partnership to new limits",
      "Richard Linklater likes to joke that if he and Ethan Hawke didn\u2019t know each other so well, Hawke probably would have punched him during the making of \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d",
      "The two Texans have been friends and collaborators for over 30 years. They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",
      "The script from author Robert Kaplow takes audiences inside the famed Broadway theater district restaurant Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in 1943. Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",
      "For over 20 years Rodgers and Hart were a prolific and successful songwriting team, behind musical hits and hundreds of classic songs, including \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d \u201cThe Lady is a Tramp\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d It\u2019s one of the great artistic partnerships of all time. This film is about that breakup.",

Hart, meanwhile, would die eight months after the \u201cOklahoma!\u201d opening, at age 48.",
      "\u201cThe country is changing, and the jazz era is ending and a new era is beginning and one of these people is going to continue on to lead and the other is going to be completely left behind,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s so funny in the face of tragedy? That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",
      "Making a life in the arts requires immense sacrifice no matter how you look at it. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the culture will pass you by. Hawke, for one, said he\u2019s had three distinct moments in his career where he was pretty sure he was washed up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",
      "The experience made him think of a lot of the people he came up with, who mentored him when he was starting out in the theater in the 1980s. Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to art careers,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI think we all think we\u2019re just going to run the table and do this until the day we die. But things get in the way.\u201d",
      "One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about (yet) is a creative breakup between Linklater and Hawke. Linklater might have given his friend some tough love, but they never argued, and in the end it was worth it. Hawke lived up to the challenge and no one got punched.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that California will begin selling affordable insulin under its own label on Jan. 1, nearly three years after he first announced a partnership to sell state-branded generic drugs at lower prices.",
      "But California won\u2019t be the only state making lower-cost insulin available. The nonprofit Civica said it will also distribute its economical diabetes medication to pharmacies nationwide.",
      "Starting in the new year, insulin pens will be available in California under the CalRx label for $11 per pen, or a maximum of $55 for a five-pack, Civica said.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need a new prescription You just simply transition to this bio-similar insulin that now is being provided,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference in Los Angeles. \u201cIt's access on the basis of affordability.\u201d",
      "The state entered a 10-year deal with Civica and Biocon Biologics in early 2023. Officials said then that they hoped California\u2019s emergence as an insulin-maker would prompt prices to collapse. Research has shown that costs for the drug have more than tripled in the past couple of decades.",
      "The new pens will be interchangeable with glargine, the generic alternative for more expensive once-a-day injections that regulates blood sugar.

      "The state also is exploring the possibility of bringing other drugs to market. Newsom announced in April that the state will sell the overdose medication Naloxone.

      "The city\u2019s chemical complex processes raw phosphate into fertilizer, an operation that for decades has discharged toxic waste directly into the Gulf of Gabes. Environmental groups say the pollution has wiped out marine life, turned the waters dark and forced generations of fishermen out of work.",

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",
      "Today, 62-year-old Mosoeunyane leads a peer support group in her village, Ha Koloboi. Neighbors ask for advice and trust her with their green medical booklets, where they record medical history, viral load, symptoms and medications.",
      "Lately, the group mostly worries \u2014 about the future, losing medication access, getting sick again.",
      "\u201cThis has been the most difficult time for me,\u201d Mosoeunyane said.",
      "Many in Mosoeunyane\u2019s group wish Trump himself could hear their concerns. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision is already translating into real life,\u201d said Mateboho Talitha Fusi, Mosoeunyane\u2019s friend and neighbor.",
      "The worries span Lesotho society: from rural to urban, low to middle income, patients to officials. Many Basotho \u2013 as people in Lesotho are known \u2013 feel hopeless.",
      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",
      "\u201cStop work immediately,\u201d she was told.",
      "Lechela\u2019s organization, the USAID-funded Phelisanang Bophelong HIV/AIDS network, had drop-in centers at gas stations where sex workers could seek services. Workers set up tents outside bars with condoms and the prevention medication known as PreP. Teams delivered medication directly to patients who wouldn\u2019t step foot in public health clinics, for fear of discrimination.",
      "Lechela\u2019s group earned the trust of the skeptics and the stubborn. All that work is gone, she fears. She still gets calls from people desperate for services and refills. She does what she can, and their stories haunt her.",
      "Among them is a textile factory worker who turned to sex work at night to support her three children. She used to take PrEP and isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll protect herself. Most clients won\u2019t use condoms, she said, some turning violent if sex workers insist.",
      "\u201cI have to put bread on the table,\u201d said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity because her husband, who works in South Africa, wouldn\u2019t approve of her sex work. She can\u2019t miss a day of factory work to wait in line at a clinic.",
      "Visiting the woman at home, all Lechela could do was demonstrate how to use a female condom \u2013 and hope her clients wouldn\u2019t notice or protest.",
      "With nearly all community groups and local organizations like Lechela\u2019s closed and 1,500 health workers fired, some Lesotho officials see overdue signs that their nation and others must stop relying on international aid.",

She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",

The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",

      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily. There had been only verbal promises, nothing in writing, he noted, and hundreds of health workers who had been promised they\u2019d be absorbed by the national health system remain unemployed.",
      "Unlike other PEPFAR-supported countries, Lesotho funded medication for 80% of its HIV patients \u2014 a figure officials tout as they try to move toward a self-sustaining system. Still, the aid cuts sparked panic over supply and distribution.",
      "Lesotho regularly gave patients a six- to 12-month supply to help its mobile population, including many who work in South Africa, stick with treatment. But when the cuts were announced, some nurses gave out even more drugs than usual.",
      "Nurses were told to cut back. Patients grew alarmed.",
      "Miner Monyamane said he got a three-month supply, not his usual 12. So instead of continuing to work in South Africa, he decided to remain in his small village of Thaba-Tsoeu Ha Mafa. Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck.

      "For the first time in more than a decade, the number of states with rates of obesity of 35% or more dropped",
      "For the first time in more than a decade, the number of states with rates of obesity of 35% or more dropped, an encouraging sign that America's epidemic of excess weight might be improving. But cuts to federal staff and programs that address chronic disease could endanger that progress, according to a new report released Thursday.",
      "Nineteen states had obesity rates of 35% or higher in 2024, down from 23 states the year before, according to an analysis of the latest data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC data was analyzed by the nonprofit group Trust for America's Health.",
      "The group\u2019s analysis follows a CDC report last year that found that the overall rate of obesity in the U.S. is high but holding steady, affecting about 40% of the population.",
      "While the decline is positive, \u201cit's too soon to call it a trend,\u201d said Dr. J. Nadine Gracia, president and chief executive for TFAH.",
      "And with recent federal funding cuts, staff layoffs and eliminated programs, \u201cthis potential progress is also at risk,\u201d Gracia said.",
      "A U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman said in an email that the administration is \u201cencouraged by the new data showing progress in the fight against obesity.\"",
      "\u201cWe are restructuring public health programs to eliminate waste, reduce bureaucracy, and redirect resources toward real prevention,\u201d said spokesman Andrew Nixon.",
      "The latest report analyzed data from the CDC's 2024 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which uses annual telephone surveys to collect data on health behaviors and chronic conditions in U.S. states and territories.",
      "It showed that 19 states had obesity rates among adults of 35% or higher, 22 states had rates between 30% and 35% and nine states had obesity rates of below 30%. The rates varied from a low of 25% in Colorado to a high of more than 40% in West Virginia.",
      "Between 2023 and 2024, no state had statistically significant increases or decreases in their obesity rates, after 18 states saw significant increases in the previous five years, the report found.",
      "Before 2013, no state had an adult obesity prevalence at or above 35%, By 2019, a dozen states had rates that high \u2014 and the number continued to climb.",

      "It's not clear exactly what may be driving the apparent improvements in obesity. Wider use of drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound \u2014 which target appetite and slow digestion \u2014 could be starting to show up in reported data, said Aviva Musicus, a science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. Increased support for nutrition assistance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic might also be a factor, she suggested.",
      "The report also details a broad range of federal, state and local efforts that focus on improving nutrition and boosting physical activity, said Solveig Cunningham, an Emory University global health expert who specializes in obesity.",
      "\u201cI think the report would argue that some of these interventions may actually be successful,\u201d said Cunningham, who was not involved with the research. \u201cThat would suggest that there are possibly ways in which we could prevent obesity at the population level, which would be a really, really big deal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "South Africa's health minister has called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab, a \"groundbreaking\" tool against the disease",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",
      "\u201cThis is not the principle of ubuntu,\u201d said Sheila Mbele-Khama, in reference to the South African philosophy that values principles such as human dignity and fairness.",

      "According to Wendy Cupido, country manager for Gilead, the South African manufacturers that were evaluated in 2024 did not satisfy the technical specifications for the production of sterile injectables at that time. She said, though, that Gilead was still willing to look at further voluntary licensing if a South African manufacturer could develop the required capabilities and meet quality standards.",
      "Welcoming the over $34 million in investment into the rollout, UNAIDS South Africa country director Eva Kiwango said at a time when foreign assistance funding cuts could lead to an additional 6 million HIV infections globally by 2029, long-acting injectable medicines were a \u201cfresh option for all people at risk,\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt is not a cure or a vaccine, but it could be a game changer if made accessible to all who could benefit,\u201d said Kiwango. \u201cFor many, lenacapavir expands choice, strengthens agency, and reduces barriers linked to stigma, disclosure, or daily adherence.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 London police are probing whether Prince Andrew asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard to dig up dirt on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre.",
      "The Metropolitan Police said it was \u201cactively looking into\u201d media reports that Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear Giuffre by asking an officer on the force to find out if she had a criminal record.",

      "Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",

Andrew told Epstein in the note that they were \u201cin this together\u201d and would \u201chave to rise above it.\u201d",
      "The Mail reported that in 2011, as the newspaper was about to publish a now-infamous photo of the prince with his arm around the partly bare midriff of Giuffre, Andrew provided his bodyguard with Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and confidential social security number to find out if she had a checkered past.",

      "Thousands of jubilant Venezuelans filled the square and draped Venezuelan flags on its police barricades, adding splashes of red, blue and yellow that perfectly matched the uniforms of the attending Swiss Guards. Thousands more who couldn't travel to Rome marked the occasion in Caracas, where the Vatican service was livestreamed before dawn at a downtown plaza.",

In all, seven people were canonized in a ceremony that Pope Francis put in motion in some of his final acts as pope.",
      "In fact, Francis approved Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s canonization from his hospital room on Feb. 24, agreeing to bypass the Vatican\u2019s typical miracle confirmation process to pronounce him a saint based on the \u201cwidespread veneration of the \u2018doctor-saint\u2019 among the faithful,\u201d the Vatican said.",

      "He became a religious icon after his death, and when Pope John Paul II visited Venezuela in 1996, he received a petition signed by 5 million people \u2014 almost one in four Venezuelans \u2014 asking that he declare Hern\u00e1ndez a saint.",
      "\u201cFor them, this is indeed a national event of the highest order,\" said Silvia Correale, who spearheaded his sainthood case. \u201cCertainly, the canonization of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio is desired by all the Venezuelan people, and has been waited for by all the people.\u201d",
      "Jos\u00e8 Ramon Malavecontreras, a Venezuelan resident in Rome, said his mother named him after Hern\u00e1ndez and attended his canonization Sunday.",
      "\u201cThey believed I\u2019d be stillborn, so she dedicated his name to me for saving my life,\" he said Sunday. \"Therefore, this moment was unmissable for me. I couldn\u2019t fail to be here.\u201d",
      "In Caracas, Arqu\u00edmides Blanco, 60, said he wasn\u2019t a particular fan of Hern\u00e1ndez but recognized the significance of his canonization for Venezuela now. Blanco belongs to a cultural collective commissioned to paint the streets surrounding Caracas' emblematic parish of La Pastora ahead of the canonization.",
      "\u201cI may not be a big fan of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio as such, but I understand that he is Venezuelan and that his canonization in the context of the whole geopolitical situation is important,\u201d he said.",

But the victim reappropriates her body by exploring its physical strength and gains courage from her connections with other women. At the end she returns on even higher stilts.",
      "\u201cAfter we go through all of this, we grow even more. We become stronger. Not that this is a good way of learning how to be a woman, but we end up stepping into it,\u201d said Rosa Caitanya Hamilton Azevedo, a 31-year-old artist who plays the victim\u2019s part and who has also suffered from gender-based violence.",
      "Juliana Berti Abduch, who has also been a victim of this form of violence, created the Suspended Circus Acrobatics project in 2020. The group\u2019s first performance in 2023 focused on domestic violence. She said the new piece isn\u2019t a continuation of that show, but a way to keep addressing and fighting violence in its many forms.",
      "Partaking in the project can be healing for the artists who have been subjected to gender-based violence, who arrive fearful and traumatized, according to Berti Abduch.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment they start the classes, they begin to overcome their limitations. This helps a lot in life in general. I\u2019m certain that the project helped make the women feel much more secure,\u201d Berti Abduch said after her piece\u2019s debut.",
      "Approximately 100 people gathered to watch the performance, some of whom were passing by and stopped, intrigued by the visually striking sight involving aerial hoops, trapezes and silks, on a beach packed with people lifting weights and playing volleyball.",
      "\u201cI found it impactful,\u201d said Fabiane Curione de Medeiros, who was in the audience. \u201cI think the message \u2014 that women need to unite and expose the violence \u2014 needs to become a reality.\u201d",

      "Both right-wing former President Jorge \u201cTuto\u201d Quiroga and centrist senator Rodrigo Paz have billed themselves as candidates of change, vowing to break with the budget-busting populism that dominated Bolivia under the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party founded by Evo Morales, a charismatic coca growers\u2019 union leader who became Bolivia\u2019s first Indigenous president in 2006.",
      "Riven by internal divisions and battered by public anger over fuel lines, MAS suffered a historic defeat in the Aug. 17 election.",
      "Both Quiroga and Paz vow to end Bolivia\u2019s fixed exchange rate, restructure state-owned companies and attract foreign investment. Among the factors that most distinguish them is how far and fast they propose pushing their reforms.",
      "Voting in the runoff is compulsory in the South American nation, and around 7.9 million Bolivians are eligible to vote.",
      "Quiroga wants to get dollars flowing into Bolivia immediately with a big rescue package from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.",
      "That would demand savage cuts in state spending, such as slashing fuel subsidies, shrinking the public payroll and cutting the state out of Bolivia\u2019s gas and mining businesses. His supporters say that\u2019s the change their country needs.",

      "A large mushroom farm near Nairobi is producing mycelium for building materials that end up as fungi-based panels, which are more sustainable and affordable than traditional bricks",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) \u2014 A large mushroom farm near the Kenyan capital of Nairobi is one of a kind: It grows fungi on an industrial scale \u2014 not as food for restaurants but as a building material that some Kenyans say could make more people homeowners.",
      "The farm produces mycelium, the root structure of mushrooms that a local company then uses to make building materials it says are more sustainable than regular brick and mortar.",
      "The company, MycoTile, combines the roots with natural fibers and agents to make panels that can be used for everything from roof and wall insulation to interior decor, at a fraction of the cost of building with standard clay bricks. It currently produces about 3,000 square meters (yards) of such materials every month.",
      "Street vendor Jedidah Murugi, whose house was made with fungi-based construction materials, said she believes \u201cthere is no huge difference in the quality of the houses made from brick and these boards.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only difference,\u201d she said, is in the cost. Her house, she added, \u201cis not cold at night and neither is it hot during the day.\u201d",
      "MycoTile\u2019s work could be a boon for Nairobi, where local leaders cite a housing crisis that has left many homeless or living in informal settlements and dwelling enclaves, prone to fires and sanitary issues. Official figures say there is a housing deficit of at least 2 million units in this metropolis of over 5 million people.",
      "Most Kenyans are renters and those who are homeowners build from the ground up over many years instead of hiring contractors. It is common to find people living in badly finished or incomplete homes to avoid paying rent elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIntroducing affordable materials like ours taps into an existing huge market and contributes to providing affordable housing solutions,\u201d said Mtamu Kililo, MycoTile's founder.",
      "Kililo said his company's insulation products cost roughly two-thirds of the price of standard materials.",
      "Building a one-bedroom unit in Nairobi using materials such as brick, timber and tin sheets typically costs up to 150,000 Kenyan shillings (about $1,000), for a simple structure, and the figure can double depending on the quality of finishes, according to estimates from builders.",
      "Using mushroom-root panels could shave off a third of the cost of building a house with bricks and mortar. Murugi, the street vendor, spent about 26,880 Kenyan shillings ($208) on the panels for her 15 square meter (161 square feet) home.",
      "Kenyan authorities have recently started working on a national plan for decarbonizing construction and building, with local-led innovation at its center.",
      "As part of the plan, the government allows MycoTile to use facilities at the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute in Nairobi, where it has access to machinery.",
      "MycoTile\u2019s fungi-based construction panels are more sustainable than traditional ones because they are biodegradable and harmless to the environment, Kililo told The Associated Press.",
      "His idea was not novel \u2014 others elsewhere have experimented with mycelium. The first mycelium house in the southern African nation of Namibia was built by the nonprofit group MycoHAB in May 2024, using technology developed for NASA.",

On Saturday, they reiterated previous demands and called for the release of demonstrators arrested during earlier Gen Z 212 protests.",

      "The protests, smaller in numbers, came eight days after King Mohammed VI in a speech at Morocco\u2019s parliament did not address the Gen Z 212 protests directly. He neither touched on their demands to dismiss Akhannouch nor the stadiums being built for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. He said that national projects and social programs could advance together.",
      "\u201cThere should be no contradiction or competition between major national projects and social programs, as both share the same goal: developing the country and improving the living conditions of citizens,\u201d Mohammed VI said in his speech, which many interpreted as an indirect response to protesters who criticized Morocco for prioritizing spending on sports infrastructure over social and economic projects.",

      "\u201cIn some ways, Prince Andrew has been the exact opposite of that,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cAnd there is no space for that in the modern monarchy.\u201d",
      "Andrew, 65, is the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth II. He spent more than 20 years as an officer in the Royal Navy before leaving to take up his royal duties in 2001.",
      "Following Friday\u2019s announcement, Andrew will no longer use his remaining royal titles, including the Duke of York, though he technically retains them. Formally stripping him of those titles would be a time-consuming process requiring an act of Parliament.",
      "Andrew\u2019s banishment completes a process that began in November 2019, when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles.",
      "That was triggered by a disastrous interview Andrew gave to the BBC as he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl, Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked by Epstein in 2001. The prince was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",

Authorities were concerned that the man could have misused his influence over Andrew, according to court documents.",
      "While the palace said Andrew had decided to give up his royal titles, royal commentator Jennie Bond said the king and Prince William exerted \u201cenormous pressure\u201d on him.",
      "\u201cWe could say he has fallen on his sword, but I think he\u2019s been pushed onto it,\u201d Bond told the BBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a decision that Andrew, quite an arrogant man \u2014 very, very fond of his status \u2014 would have willingly made without a lot of pressure.\u201d",

      "Protests have erupted in Morocco, driven by young people demanding change",
      "RABAT, Morocco (AP) \u2014 Demonstrations in more than a dozen cities have jolted Morocco for weeks, with the young people behind them showing they can translate digital discontent into a real-world movement that authorities can\u2019t ignore.",
      "The North African nation is the latest to be rocked by \u201cGen Z\u201d protests against corruption, lack of opportunity and business as usual. New protests are expected Saturday.",
      "Similar movements have risen in countries such as Madagascar, Kenya, Peru and Nepal. They differ in origin but share a common refusal to go through institutions like political parties or unions to be heard.",
      "In Morocco, anger has boiled over contrasts between government spending on stadiums in the lead-up to the 2030 FIFA World Cup and a subpar health system that lags behind countries with similarly sized economies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "A leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 is the engine behind the protests. Members debate strategy on Discord, a chat app popular with gamers and teens. The core group has about 180,000 members, but spinoffs have also sprouted, organizing demonstrations in towns independently.",
      "Like other nations swept by Gen Z protests, Morocco is experiencing a youth bulge, with more than half of the population under 35. Yet, as the country pours billions into infrastructure and tourism, unemployment for Moroccans ages 15-24 has climbed to 36%. And with opportunity lacking, more than half of Moroccans under 35 say they have considered emigrating, according to a June survey from non-partisan research network Afrobarometer.",
      "When demonstrations turned violent earlier this month, officials said most participants were minors and rights groups said many detained were under 18.",
      "Morocco is Africa\u2019s most visited country, appealing to tourists from around the world with its medieval palaces, bustling markets and sweeping mountain and desert landscapes. But not far from tourist routes, the daily reality for most of Morocco\u2019s 37 million people includes soaring costs of living and stagnating wages.",
      "The North African Kingdom has made significant strides in lifting standards of living, but development has been uneven and critics say it has exacerbated inequities.",
      "Morocco boasts Africa\u2019s only high-speed rail line and is constructing seven new stadiums and renovating seven others in preparation for the World Cup. It plans to spend more than $5 billion on infrastructure for the event, some from the private sector. Yet with a monthly minimum wage of around $300, many languish in poverty in areas where roads are unpaved, hospitals lack doctors and classrooms are underfunded and overcrowded.",
      "Morocco has only 7.7 medical professionals per 10,000 inhabitants and far fewer in parts of the south and east where protests have become most heated. The public health system provides more than 80% of care, but accounts for only 40% of spending, with the rest coming from private or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "Before Gen Z 212, localized protests against regional inequities and government priorities erupted, including in Al Haouz, where many remain in tents more than two years after a deadly 2023 earthquake. Anger boiled in September after eight women died giving birth in a public hospital in the coastal city of Agadir. Despite its renovated airport and reputation as a destination for tourists, the city is the capital of one of Morocco\u2019s poorest provinces where residents have decried a lack of doctors and quality medical care.",
      "Protesters, angry over corruption, have likened the government to a mafia and targeted Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and Health Minister Amine Tahraoui, his former business associate. Akhannouch, one of Morocco\u2019s richest men, controls most of the country\u2019s gas stations, and one of his companies recently won controversial government contracts for new desalination projects.",
      "Morocco\u2019s business interests, including the royal family\u2019s investment fund Al Mada, have also projected substantial profits from World Cup-related developments, including new stadiums, train lines and hotels, according to the magazine Jeune Afrique.",
      "Protesters have chanted \u201cStadiums are here, but where are the hospitals?\" in a jab at Morocco\u2019s spending on spectacle projects for the World Cup and what many see as the government's blindness to everyday hardship.",

      "Gen Z 212 published a letter addressed to King Mohammed VI asking him to dismiss the government and corrupt political parties, release detainees and convene a government forum to hold officials accountable.",
      "The political demands diverged from earlier nebulous calls for dignity and social justice, and reflected a broad sentiment that Morocco has not made serious strides to overcome problems that the king vowed to address during 2017 mass demonstrations. At the time, he acknowledged development had not adequately trickled down to benefit all.",
      "Though the king is the country\u2019s highest authority, Gen Z protesters directed their ire at government officials and called on him to oversee reforms. Many on the streets shouted: \u201cThe people want the King to intervene.\"",
      "In an address to Parliament this month, the king defended Morocco\u2019s vision for the future, arguing that large-scale projects and social programs can advance together. He mirrored some of the protesters\u2019 grievances but didn\u2019t address the movement directly.",
      "\u201cSocial justice is not a temporary priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be no contradiction or competition between major national projects and social programs, as both share the same goal: developing the country and improving the living conditions of citizens wherever they may be.\"",
      "Security forces have alternated between crackdown and retreat.",
      "Riot police and plainclothes officers arrested demonstrators en masse on the weekend of Sept. 27 and 28. Police in a small town outside of Agadir fired on demonstrators they claimed were storming one of their posts in early October, killing three, and a police van rammed into protesters in the eastern city of Oujda, injuring one.",
      "But elsewhere, security forces eased their presence, standing aside as rioters and looters set cars ablaze and smashed storefronts.",
      "Moroccan courts have handed down a string of convictions tied to the protests, with sentences ranging from four to 20 years for vandalism and incitement, according to Human Rights Watch.",
      "After the initial protests, Akhannouch and several of his Cabinet members said the government was open to dialogue with protesters and suggested fortifying existing hospitals with additional staff and opening new medical facilities.",
      "But as Moroccans watch stadiums being built in a matter of months, promised changes have rung hollow to many demonstrators since no official has yet proposed redirecting stadium funds to social services.",
      "\u201cThe government is taking patchwork measures to ease the pressure,\" Youssef, a 27-year-old demonstrator, said. \"Their reforms will take years.\u201d",

      "In the town of Metepec, southwest of Mexico City, artisans create clay figures that are intertwined with their faith",
      "METEPEC, Mexico (AP) \u2014 The first time he met a pope, Mexican craftsman Hilario Hern\u00e1ndez could not believe his luck. He did not travel to the Vatican as a guest, but as the guardian of the fragile ceramic piece he had created as a gift for Benedict XVI.",
      "\u201cNo one really planned to take me along,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cBut a Tree of Life can easily break, so I got the chance to bring it myself.\u201d",
      "The work he was commissioned to create for the pope in 2008 is a celebrated expression of Mexican craftsmanship.",
      "Known as a Tree of Life, it belongs to a tradition that flourished in the hands of artisans in the mid-20th century and is considered a symbol of identity in Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s hometown.",
      "In Metepec, where he lives and runs a family workshop about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Mexico City, dozens of craftsmen devote themselves to creating Trees of Life. Their designs vary, but most share a common motif: the biblical scene of Genesis, with Adam and Eve at the center, separated by the tree\u2019s trunk and a coiled snake.",
      "\u201cThe tree allows you to express whatever you want,\u201d said Carolina Ram\u00edrez, a guide at Metepec\u2019s Clay Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s a source of pride for us, as it has become part of the town\u2019s identity and charm.\u201d",
      "The museum holds an annual contest that encourages artisans from across Mexico to submit their versions of the tree. It now houses more than 300 pieces and displays a permanent selection of them.",
      "Aside from Adam and Eve, the trees display a variety of figures like Catrinas \u2014 skeletal female figures that have become a symbol of Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead celebrations \u2014 and Xoloitzcuintles, hairless dogs sacred to ancient Nahua people.",
      "\u201cA tree\u2019s theme draws from our culture and traditions,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cAnd for the people who buy them, they\u2019ve become a source of identity.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s ancestors have crafted clay pieces for as long as he can remember. His grandfather, now 103, still creates pots in Metepec.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the fifth generation of potters and artisans,\u201d said Felipe, one of Hilario\u2019s younger brothers. \u201cOur knowledge is passed down by word-of-mouth.\u201d",
      "All five siblings trained for technical careers. None went on to practice them, choosing to become full-time artisans instead.",
      "Hilario \u2014 the eldest \u2014 became his brothers\u2019 mentor. Their tasks now rotate among them. While one shapes leaves for the trees, another attaches them or paints. All take pride in their family\u2019s legacy.",
      "Luis, now 34, said he has crafted Trees of Life since age 12. \u201cThis workshop was my playground,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWhat I initially thought of as a game, later became my job.\u201d",
      "Another local artisan, Cecilio S\u00e1nchez, also inherited his father\u2019s skills and went on to found his own workshop. Now his wife, two children and other relatives work together to create a tradition of their own.",
      "His technique is known as pigmented clay and consists of mixing clay with oxides. \u201cSome fellow artisans add industrial pigments to their pieces, but our work is about preserving what the earth itself gives us,\u201d he said.",

      "Drawing on his father\u2019s ancestral wisdom, he fired the 2-meter-tall (6.6-foot-tall) clay piece at just the right temperature. To transport it, he wrapped it like a giant mummy using 200 rolls of toilet paper to cushion and seal every hollow space.",
      "Then there was the design. For six months, he and his family patiently crafted figures on both sides \u2014 a challenge rarely faced in the business. One face told the story of Mexico\u2019s most revered saints; the other, the origins of Metepec\u2019s Tree of Life.",
      "The details of that history are unclear. Yet experts agree that such trees might have played a role in evangelization after the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century.",
      "According to Ram\u00edrez, the first artisans to reinterpret them in modern times incorporated elements distinctive to Metepec. One of them is known as the Tlanchana, a half-woman, half-serpent figure who, legend has it, once ruled the waters around the town.",
      "\u201cIt was thought that her coming out of the water brought abundance,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cFor our ancestors, deities were bound to fire, water and nature.\u201d",
      "The Tlanchana figures in Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Trees of Life, though, no longer resemble snakes. Given that the reptile is regarded as a representation of evil, temptation and death within the Catholic worldview, its tail was replaced. In her current form as a mermaid, she is perhaps Metepec\u2019s most iconic symbol alongside the Tree of Life.",
      "Hilario keeps a special frame on his worktable: a photograph of the day he met a pope for the second time.",
      "On that occasion he didn\u2019t travel to the Vatican. In 2015, a stranger knocked on his door and asked him to create another Tree of Life \u2014 this time, for another pope. Francis was soon to visit Mexico and the president wanted the artisan to present him with a masterpiece.",
      "Hilario\u2019s new assignment took three months of hard, family work. Francis\u2019 tree would not be as tall as the one made for Benedict. But the design presented challenges of its own, as it was to portray the pope\u2019s life.",
      "The craftsman visited nearby chapels, spoke to priests and read as much as he could. In February 2016, when he met the pope inside Mexico\u2019s Presidential Palace, he realized he still had much to learn.",
      "\u201cHe ended up explaining to me his own tree,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he added: \u2018I know you didn\u2019t do this on your own, so God bless your family and your hands.\u2019\u201d",
      "The meeting had a life-changing effect on him. It made him reflect on his purpose in life and reaffirmed his calling to his craft.",
      "\u201cMaking Trees of Life is a commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how we make a living, but it\u2019s also how we keep our culture alive.\u201d",

      "Trade unions in Nevada want the state to offer tax incentives to major film studios to bring more movie making to the Vegas area",
      "LAS VEGAS -- LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Movies like \u201cThe Hangover\u201d and \u201cOcean's Eleven\u201d piqued interest in the Las Vegas Strip long ago. But now Nevada labor unions hoping to boost jobs and tourism are pushing state officials to offer tax credits aimed at bringing more Hollywood filmmaking to the state.",
      "The effort to offer up to $95 million in tax credits to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery for a new film production facility in the Vegas suburbs didn't win enough legislative support earlier this year. But more than a dozen labor unions are pushing to revive the proposal during an expected special session next month.",
      "\u201cWe believe if we can get the public behind us, we\u2019ll be able to get the legislators to understand what a big change this can bring to Southern Nevada,\u201d said Tommy White, business manager-secretary treasurer of Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, Local 872 in Las Vegas.",
      "Trade unions formed a political action committee called Nevada Jobs Now, which has raised over $1 million to be used for digital advertisements, mailers and some TV commercials, White said. The production companies behind the project say it would create 19,000 construction jobs.",
      "If the unions are successful, Las Vegas would be competing with cities like Atlanta, where the film industry has boomed for more than a decade thanks to a far more generous tax break. California, meanwhile, recently revamped its own tax incentive programs to combat a multiyear downward trend in Hollywood film production.",
      "The production companies would not come to Las Vegas if they don\u2019t receive the tax incentives, according to David O\u2019Reilly, CEO of Howard Hughes Holdings, the developer of the proposal called Summerlin Studios. It would include 10 movie stages, hotels, a medical center and be part of a master-planned neighborhood in West Las Vegas.",
      "\u201cThere would be no reason for Sony and Warner to film in Nevada when they can get tax credits in 20 other states or around the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to bring their productions to where they have the best economic deal, and we\u2019re just trying to make Nevada competitive with everybody else.\u201d",
      "To be eligible for the tax credits, $400 million needs to be spent building a studio and $1.8 billion spent building the mixed-use development of shops and restaurants, O\u2019Reilly said. Sony and Warner Bros. would have to spend $4.5 billion over 15 years. They would be eligible for the tax credits after the studio is built and filming begins, he said.",
      "The proposal comes as Las Vegas continues to see a decline in tourism. Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported an 11.3% decline in visitors.",
      "White and other supporters argue that not only will the film studios bring jobs and revenue, it will also attract tourists.",
      "\u201cWith movie studios, you bring in a whole different type of tourist,\u201d White said, likening it to how major sports teams draw visitors. \u201cYou don\u2019t just bring the person that\u2019s come in to go to a resort to gamble.\u201d",

But it is expensive \u2014 the state in 2024 was projected to give out $1.35 billion in credits that year alone.",
      "The state's return is an average of 17 cents in tax revenue for every state dollar spent, according to Carlianne Patrick, an associate professor at Georgia State University who conducts audits of the state\u2019s tax credit programs.",

      "They argue the project is \u201cfiscally irresponsible and politically indefensible\u201d and would only generate $0.52 in tax revenue for every $1 in credit, citing a May 2025 report commissioned by the state.",

      "One of China\u2019s most important meetings begins Monday, as its top leader Xi Jinping and other ruling Communist Party elites gather in Beijing to map out the country\u2019s goals for the next five years",
      "HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 One of China\u2019s most important meetings begins Monday, as leader Xi Jinping and other ruling Communist Party elites gather in Beijing to map out the goals for the next five years.",
      "The closed-door gathering \u2014 known as the fourth plenum \u2014 is expected to last four days and will discuss and put the final touches on China\u2019s next five-year plan, a blueprint for 2026-2030.",
      "The leaders are meeting at a time of heightened trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and just ahead of a possible meeting between Xi and U.S. President Donald Trump during a regional summit later this month.",
      "Here is what to know about the meeting:",
      "The fourth plenum refers to the fourth plenary session, out of typically a total of seven sessions during the five-year term of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s central committee. Xi and about 370 members of the central committee are expected to attend.",
      "The gathering also may coincide with personnel changes. Since it's held behind closed doors, details may come days or weeks later.",
      "Such gatherings are meant to help unite officials and the public behind the party's agenda.",
      "The full five-year plan for 2026-2030 and specifics will likely not be released until the annual session of the National People's Congress is held in March.",
      "But there is little reason to expect a radical shift away from the format and messaging style of previous five-year plans, Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, said in an interview.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is forecast to expand by 4.8% this year, according to the World Bank, a figure close to China\u2019s official target of about 5% growth. China faces challenges from the trade war that has intensified since Trump took office, but also from chronic domestic problems that are dragging on growth.",
      "Longstanding efforts to boost consumer spending and investment by businesses and to curb excess capacity in many industries top the list of economic priorities. But Xi also will likely highlight China's push to become the global leader in many technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "China\u2019s pursuit of technological \u201cself-sufficiency,\u201d weaning its industries of their reliance on advanced computer chips from the U.S., has sped up as Trump tightens American export control measures and raises tariffs. That could result in more spending on advanced technology, said Ning Zhang, a senior China economist at UBS.",

      "One key question is whether there will be any meaningful shift in the leadership\u2019s approach to boosting consumption, said Leah Fahy, a China economist at Capital Economics. The government has adopted incremental policy moves \u2014 such as increased government subsidies for childcare, consumer loans, and trade-in programs for appliances and electric vehicles.",
      "Boosting consumption, which would drive borrowing and demand, is \u201cmuch more important than before\u201d but consumer confidence has been undermined by the bursting of China's property bubble several years ago, Zhang explained.",
      "Economists say bolder moves are needed to make a significant difference.",
      "Price wars in the auto industry are an example of the risks of the ferocious competition that results from overcapacity that afflicts many Chinese industries. China's exports \u2014 including to Southeast Asia and Africa \u2014 have surged as companies seek markets beyond its borders, adding to friction with the United States and other trading partners.",
      "Since the massive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has struggled to reignite faster economic growth. Its property sector downturn has complicated that effort, causing massive layoffs and leading families to cut back on spending as house prices have fallen.",
      "Wendy Leutert, a professor of economics and trade at Indiana University, noted in a recent report that China is still stinting on spending on areas that might help to balance the economy and encourage more consumer spending, such as health care, education and child and elder care.",
      "\u201cOverall, China\u2019s leaders still appear willing to accept economic costs, including resource misallocation and failures, in order to pursue self-sufficiency and technological leadership in strategically important industries and strengthen overall national power,\u201d she wrote.",
      "While it faces increasing friction with the U.S. and other trading partners, China is also running up against demographic pressures, as its population of 1.4 billion begins to shrink and age more rapidly. The unemployment rate for young workers aged 16-24 is nearly 19%, according to official data, impinging on their potential contributions to the economy.",
      "The Chinese leadership has set a goal of doubling the size of China\u2019s economy in 2020 by 2035, and like any other government, \u201cstill cares (about) growth and is still trying to get richer,\u201d said Zhang of UBS.",
      "He estimates that keeping the economy growing at a robust 4% to 5% pace in the next decade will likely be \u201cchallenging.\u201d But it's imperative to show it is striving for such ambitious goals, to demonstrate the ruling party's capacity to keep delivering a better quality of life \u2014 its chief claim to its legitimacy.",
      "\"For China\u2019s leadership, what do they care about? Stability, legitimacy, and also ongoing support,\" he said.",

      "Advocates for student media, Indiana Daily Student alumni and high-profile supporters including billionaire Mark Cuban have blasted the school for stepping on the outlet\u2019s independence.",
      "The Daily Student is routinely honored among the best collegiate publications in the country. It receives about $250,000 annually in subsidies from the university's Media School to help make up for dwindling ad revenue.",

      "Sounds hard to believe, but a young Victoria Beckham was put in the back row at theater school for being too heavy",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Now here\u2019s something you might not quite believe about Victoria Beckham, glam Spice Girl turned high-profile fashion designer: At theater school, they purposely put her in the back row. Because she was too heavy.",
      "\u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d she says now of the memory from her youth, sipping a sparkling water in a Manhattan hotel in between work engagements. \u201cWe were all judged on how we looked. I was young. I had bad skin, my weight was going up and down, I had really lank hair.\u201d",
      "Beckham was also bullied in school and told she was a bad learner, revelations that come in a new documentary, \u201cVictoria Beckham.\u201d The three-part Netflix series traces her career and especially her ascension in the fashion world \u2014 building up to a grand Paris runway show at a palace in front of 600 people.",
      "That 2024 show \u2014 with a rainstorm threatening to scuttle the whole thing \u2014 is presented as a career pinnacle for a designer who spent years proving herself alongside giants of the field, showing she wasn\u2019t simply a celebrity slapping her name on a label. ( Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour is among the fashion luminaries attesting to Beckham\u2019s hard-won industry acceptance in the documentary).",

      "Some reviews have said Victoria\u2019s documentary feels more guarded and less revelatory. In any case, Victoria Beckham says wanted to tell her own story, her own way. She focuses only briefly on what a certain generation knows her best for \u2014 the four years she spent as Posh Spice \u2014 and mostly on the two decades she\u2019s been building her eponymous fashion and beauty brand.",
      "Other revelations: While she was the richer partner when they married in 1999 and in fact bought their first house, it was David Beckham who later invested in her label and helped get it going.",
      "She also talks about how her company almost fell apart due to bad business decisions \u2014 like spending 70,000 pounds (about $94,000) on office plants and 15,000 (about $20,000) more to water them \u2014 and how she learned, with investors, to right the ship.",
      "Beckham, 51, sat down with The Associated Press this week during a visit to New York. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "BECKHAM: Well, his documentary wasn\u2019t about me, you know. I was in the documentary as David\u2019s wife and I\u2019ve been part of his journey and I was so honored to talk about that. People\u2019s response to me in that really surprised me, and there was something quite liberating about that because when I saw myself ... I didn\u2019t like how I came across. But then I think I\u2019ve always felt that way about myself. I suppose it gave me the confidence to do my own.",

A time that I\u2019m so proud of, but I\u2019ve fighting preconceptions because of that period. I feel that only now is my brand in a place where me talking about my past will not affect the brand that I\u2019ve built.",

And by the way, that started when I was a child, when I was at school. If anybody watches this documentary and I can give them the confidence to follow their dreams, that\u2019s another really good reason to do it.",

It got to a stage where my investors told me that we had to re-strategize not just the business side of things but the creative things as well. And that was difficult. ... We had to change a lot of things to fix the business and I took it on the chin. Of course that meant compromising, but I wanted to save the business.",

I\u2019m an independent brand as well, so I\u2019m incredibly proud to say the fashion is making money. Beauty is also doing incredibly well.

      "AmEx shared data with investors that indicate customers were not turned off by the higher annual fee and increased competition from new products.

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 The factory floor used to roar.",
      "Walking around his textile mill in southern Buenos Aires, Luciano Galfione pointed out the up-to-the-minute machines that once whirred and clattered as 200 employees churned out fabric to be transformed into athleisure and other apparel for Argentina\u2019s vast middle class.",
      "But on Monday afternoon, the factory was so quiet that Galfione's footsteps rang clear through the compound. A handful of workers at the Galfione Group factory in Argentina\u2019s capital spooled yarn and dyed cloth.",
      "Almost two years after libertarian President Javier Milei stormed to power on a promise to rescue Argentina\u2019s crisis-stricken economy through harsh austerity and free-market reforms, falling orders and surging competition have forced Galfione to cut operations by 80%, lay off or suspend half his staff and use his own savings to keep his family's 78-year-old firm afloat.",
      "Other companies have simply closed their doors. Over 17,600 businesses \u2014 among them 1,800 manufacturers and 380 textile companies \u2014 have folded in the last year and a half, according to Fundaci\u00f3n Pro Tejer, a nonprofit representing textile manufacturers.",

      "As Argentina heads to Oct. 26 midterm elections widely seen as a referendum on Milei\u2019s policies, Galfione\u2019s troubles reflect bigger shocks jolting the country. The economy has sputtered. Cheap imports have gutted manufacturing. Spending has stumbled, squeezed by higher unemployment and lower wages.",
      "The turmoil engulfing Argentine financial markets began when voters in the manufacturing belt of suburban Buenos Aires \u2014 a region that for decades represented the dream of national industry nurtured by tariff protection \u2014 punished Milei in a provincial election last month.",
      "The scale of Milei's humiliation triggered a sharp peso sell-off and sent officials scrambling to secure $20 billion in financing from a friendly Trump administration.",
      "President Donald Trump, who sees a kindred spirit and fellow culture warrior in Argentina's chain saw wielding leader, shocked Argentines and Americans alike Tuesday by warning that the $20 billion was contingent on Milei's success in what is shaping up to be a hotly contested legislative election.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went further on Wednesday, saying that the U.S. could tap investment funds to provide Argentina with up to $40 billion.",

      "Over a year ago, markets cheered as Milei fulfilled his flagship promise to reduce the runway inflation that he inherited from his populist predecessors. Many Argentines \u2014 who had grown accustomed to supermarkets revising prices upward everyday \u2014 hailed Milei's program as a miraculous outbreak of normalcy in a notoriously topsy-turvy economy.",
      "But today, price stability is old news as Argentines contend with a lengthening list of worries.",
      "Unemployment in Buenos Aires Province climbed to 9.8% in the second quarter of this year, compared to 7.3% during the same period in 2023, before Milei entered office. Salaries nationwide haven't kept up with inflation. Milei's major subsidy cuts mean that even if prices have stabilized, Argentines are paying more for bus fares, utility bills and healthcare.",

      "The country\u2019s largest teachers unions are teaming up with tech companies like Microsoft and OpenAI to help educators build literacy in artificial intelligence",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

      "Investors looked past a 22% drop in CSX\u2019s third quarter earnings Thursday and focused on the direction the railroad\u2019s new CEO might take it and the possibility of any strategic deals.",
      "CEO Steve Angel promised to focus on making CSX the best-performing railroad. Without promising a merger, Angel said he would consider any strategic opportunities that make sense for shareholders. He also reminded investors that he ran industrial gas supplier Praxair for a decade before the opportunity to merge with rival Linde came up.",
      "\u201cThe way these things work \u2014 these strategic opportunities \u2014 you\u2019ve got to wait for the right timing. You\u2019ve got to wait for when the conditions are right,\u201d Angel said. \u201cSo what you do in the interim, you run the company to the best of your ability every day, and you create value that way. And so if and when that time comes, you\u2019re going into that discussion from a position of strength.\u201d",
      "Thursday\u2019s report was the first since Angel took the job late last month. The railroad is under pressure from investors, such as Ancora Holdings, to find another railroad to merge with, so CSX can better compete with the merged Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern railroad if that $85 billion deal gets approved. But both of CSX\u2019s likely merger partners \u2014 BNSF and CPKC railroads \u2014 have said they aren\u2019t interested in a deal because they believe the industry can better serve customers through cooperative agreements and avoid all the potential headaches that come with a merger.",

That transcontinental railroad will be able to shave more than a day off delivery times because it won\u2019t have to hand off shipments between railroads in the middle of the country. So far, CSX and BNSF say they can achieve most of the benefits of a merger through cooperative agreements instead.",
      "Angel, 70, has not worked at a railroad before although earlier in his career he worked at GE\u2019s locomotive building unit and developed a lifelong appreciation for railroads. He stressed the similarities between industrial gas companies and railroads, saying both focus on safety and invest heavily in the most profitable areas with the highest traffic.",

      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",

      "Mortgage rates started declining in July in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.",

      "France\u2019s latest political crisis has eased, for now",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 France\u2019s latest political crisis eased \u2014 for now \u2014 when Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu survived two consecutive no-confidence votes on Thursday, averting another government collapse and giving President Emmanuel Macron a respite before an even tougher fight over the national budget.",
      "The immediate danger may have receded but the core problem is still very much center stage. The eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy is still run by a minority government in a splintered parliament where no single bloc or party has a majority.",
      "Every major law now turns on last-minute deals, and the next test is a spending plan that must pass before the end of the year.",
      "On Thursday, lawmakers in the 577-seat National Assembly rejected a no-confidence motion filed by the hard-left France Unbowed party. The 271 votes were 18 short of the 289 needed to bring down the government.",
      "A second motion from the far-right National Rally also failed.",
      "Had Lecornu lost, Macron would have faced only unpalatable options: call new legislative elections, try to find yet another prime minister \u2014 France\u2019s fifth in barely a year \u2014 or perhaps even resign himself, which he has ruled out.",
      "Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024 backfired on him, triggering legislative elections that stacked the powerful lower house with opponents of the French leader but producing no outright winner.",
      "Since then, Macron\u2019s minority governments have sought to barter support bill by bill and have fallen in quick succession.",
      "That collides with the architecture of the Fifth Republic, founded in 1958 under Charles de Gaulle.",
      "The system was built for a strong presidency and stable parliamentary majorities, not for coalition horse-trading or a splintered house.",
      "With no single bloc near an absolute majority of 289 seats, the machinery is grinding against its design, turning big votes into cliffhangers and raising existential questions about the governance of France.",
      "For French voters and observers, it\u2019s jarring. France, once a model of eurozone stability, is now stumbling from crisis to crisis, testing the patience of markets and allies.",
      "To peel away opposition votes, Lecornu offered to slow the rollout of Macron\u2019s flagship 2023 pension law, which raises the retirement age from 62 to 64.",
      "The proposed slowdown could push the law back roughly two years, easing near-term pressure on people nearing retirement while leaving the end goal intact.",
      "The government puts the short-term cost of the delay at 400 million euros ($430 million) for next year and 1.8 billion euros ($1.9 billion) for 2027, saying it will find offsets.",

      "Monreal, 47, and her husband, Jorge, 57, rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health coverage. If Congress doesn\u2019t extend certain ACA tax credits set to expire at the end of the year, their fully subsidized plan will increase in cost, putting it out of reach. Without insurance, they won\u2019t be able to afford his expected knee replacement surgeries, much less the treatment they need for other issues, like her chronic high blood pressure and his high cholesterol.",
      "\u201cIt worries me sometimes, because if you\u2019re not healthy, then you\u2019re not here for your kids,\u201d Monreal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult decision, because, OK, do I spend $500 on a doctor\u2019s visit or do I buy groceries?\u201d",
      "Those are the types of choices facing the millions of Americans whose state or federal marketplace health insurance plans will be up for renewal in November. The enhanced premium tax credits that have made coverage more affordable for low- and middle-income enrollees for the last four years will expire this year if Congress doesn't extend them. On average, that will more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "The tax credits are at the heart of the federal government shutdown, in its third week with no end in sight. Democrats have demanded the subsidies be extended as part of any funding deal they sign, while Republicans say they'll only negotiate on the issue once the government is funded.",

      "If the tax credits expire, annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to the KFF analysis.",
      "While some premium tax credits will remain, the level of support will decrease for most enrollees. Anyone earning more than 400% of the poverty level \u2014 or around $63,000 per year for a single person \u2014 won\u2019t be eligible for the remaining tax credits.",
      "As a result, especially hard-hit groups will include a small number of higher earners who'll have to pay a lot more without the extra subsidies and a large number of lower earners who'll have to pay a small amount more, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.",
      "With higher premiums, some people will drop out of health insurance altogether, Cox said. When many younger, healthier people inevitably forgo coverage, insurance companies will increase costs for members of the covered population to account for them being older and sicker.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",
      "Colleges are belatedly realizing how important that kind of data is to students and their families, said Lee Roberts, chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill, in an interview.",
      "\u201cIn uncertain times, students are even more focused \u2014 I would say rightly so \u2014 on what their job prospects are going to be,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think colleges and universities really owe students and their families this data.\u201d",

      "Facing third-and-9 from their 44 with 1:45 left and the Vikings (3-3) still holding two timeouts, Hurts dropped back and dropped a 45-yard rainbow into Brown's arms to seal it after he beat former teammate Isaiah Rodgers with a slick double move up the sideline.

      "Backup center Blake Brandel struggled badly there, too. He had an errant third-down shotgun snap that sailed over Wentz's head and cost the Vikings 22 yards in the first quarter and was run over by Moro Ojomo for a third-down sack in the fourth quarter from the 10.",

      "Xavier Legette had the best game of his career, catching nine passes for 92 yards and a score.",

      "And now they, too, have a major question at quarterback.",
      "With the Jets trailing 13-3 in the third quarter, Fields was benched in favor of Taylor. Fields was 6 of 12 for 46 yards in the first two quarters, unable to do much with the offense with top wide receiver Garrett Wilson out with a knee injury. With the Jets needing a spark in this one, Glenn decided to make the change.",
      "Taylor jogged onto the field with the offense to loud cheers from the fans at MetLife Stadium.",

      "Taylor moved the offense with a little more success than Fields, but his two interceptions short-circuited drives. Taylor was 10 of 22 for 126 yards.",
      "On the Jets' opening drive, Glenn chose to go for it on fourth-and-5 from the Panthers 33 rather than try a 51-yard field goal. But Fields' throw to Josh Reynolds sailed incomplete for a turnover on downs.",

      "\u201cIt comes down to the last play,\u201d interim cosch Frank Reich said. \u201cJust credit to our defense ... just to keep him just short of the goal line. I know it was close, but just that last-ditch effort to get him on the ground. Big play.\u201d",
      "The Seminoles (3-4, 0-4) nearly pulled off an improbable comeback when backup quarterback Kevin Sperry completed a 49-yard desperation heave to Micahi Danzy on third and 22 to get the ball to the 9 with 2 seconds left.",

      "Castellanos was knocked out on the that drive on a targeting foul against Mitch Leigber. Sperry came in and almost led the Seminoles to the their first conference win since beating California on Sept. 21, 2024.",

But they did fight to the end. ... We were there on the last play and had a chance and they said we were short.\u201d",

      "Hospitals and doctors' offices are inviting singers and musicians to help patients manage their pain, as music's ability to reduce pain is gaining attention",
      "Nurse Rod Salaysay works with all kinds of instruments in the hospital: a thermometer, a stethoscope and sometimes his guitar and ukulele.",
      "In the recovery unit of UC San Diego Health, Salaysay helps patients manage pain after surgery. Along with medications, he offers tunes on request and sometimes sings. His repertoire ranges from folk songs in English and Spanish to Minuet in G Major and movie favorites like \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d",
      "Patients often smile or nod along. Salaysay even sees changes in their vital signs like lower heart rate and blood pressure, and some may request fewer painkillers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s often a cycle of worry, pain, anxiety in a hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can help break that cycle with music.\u201d",
      "Salaysay is a one-man band, but he\u2019s not alone. Over the past two decades, live performances and recorded music have flowed into hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices as research grows on how songs can help ease pain.",
      "The healing power of song may sound intuitive given music\u2019s deep roots in human culture. But the science of whether and how music dulls acute and chronic pain \u2014 technically called music-induced analgesia \u2014 is just catching up.",
      "No one suggests that a catchy song can fully eliminate serious pain. But several recent studies, including in the journals Pain and Scientific Reports, have suggested that listening to music can either reduce the perception of pain or enhance a person\u2019s ability to tolerate it.",
      "What seems to matter most is that patients \u2014 or their families \u2014 choose the music selections themselves and listen intently, not just as background noise.",
      "\u201cPain is a really complex experience,\u201d said Adam Hanley, a psychologist at Florida State University. \u201cIt\u2019s created by a physical sensation, and by our thoughts about that sensation and emotional reaction to it.\u201d",
      "Two people with the same condition or injury may feel vastly different levels of acute or chronic pain. Or the same person might experience pain differently from one day to the next.",
      "Acute pain is felt when pain receptors in a specific part of the body \u2014 like a hand touching a hot stove \u2014 send signals to the brain, which processes the short-term pain. Chronic pain usually involves long-term structural or other changes to the brain, which heighten overall sensitivity to pain signals. Researchers are still investigating how this occurs.",
      "\u201cPain is interpreted and translated by the brain,\" which may ratchet the signal up or down, said Dr. Gilbert Chandler, a specialist in chronic spinal pain at the Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic.",
      "Researchers know music can draw attention away from pain, lessening the sensation. But studies also suggest that listening to preferred music helps dull pain more than listening to podcasts.",
      "\u201cMusic is a distractor. It draws your focus away from the pain. But it\u2019s doing more than that,\" said Caroline Palmer, a psychologist at McGill University who studies music and pain.",
      "Scientists are still tracing the various neural pathways at work, said Palmer.",
      "\u201cWe know that almost all of the brain becomes active when we engage in music,\u201d said Kate Richards Geller, a registered music therapist in Los Angeles. \u201cThat changes the perception and experience of pain \u2014 and the isolation and anxiety of pain.\u201d",

But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",

Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",

      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",
      "Days before the deadly protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline. Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.",

      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "The first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.",
      "In granting a license, Hong Kong's transport commissioner can consider the firm\u2019s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region.

      "\"I've never called anybody an enemy,\u201d Johnson said, but claimed that \"there were a lot of hateful messages\" during Saturday's protests.",

So 21 days later, when the House returned to regular legislative session, they were administered the oath. That's what we're doing. We're not in session right now. Rep. Grijalva was elected after the House was out of session. As soon as we returned the legislative session, as soon as the Democrats decide to turn the lights back on so we can all get back here, I will administer the oath --",

      "Two of the thieves arrived at the museum in the mobile freight elevator, one wearing a yellow vest and the other an orange vest, according to police. Two accomplices arrived at the museum at the same time on what police described as \"T-max vehicles\" or sports motorbikes.",
      "\"The staff on site, upon seeing what was happening, took to safety,\" according to the police statement. \"An alarm was triggered at 9:37 a.m. The perpetrators exited through the window by going back down the freight elevator before fleeing on the two motorbikes at 9:38 a.m.\"",

      "Police say they're investigating a video obtained by BFMTV, a French news broadcast television and radio network, which they believe shows one of the suspects appearing to try to access one of the jewelry cases.",
      "Following the heist, police found two angle grinders, a blowtorch, gasoline, gloves, a walkie-talkie, a blanket, and a crown at the scene.

Thousands more who couldn't travel to Rome marked the occasion in Caracas, where the Vatican service was livestreamed before dawn at a downtown plaza.",
      "The Mass, which the Vatican said drew some 70,000 people, also gave Papua New Guinea its first saint: Peter To Rot, a layman killed in prison in 1945 for standing up for monogamous marriage at a time when polygamy was practiced. In all, seven people were canonized in a ceremony that Pope Francis put in motion in some of his final acts as pope.",
      "In fact, Francis approved Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s canonization from his hospital room on Feb. 24, agreeing to bypass the Vatican\u2019s typical miracle confirmation process to pronounce him a saint based on the \u201cwidespread veneration of the \u2018doctor-saint\u2019 among the faithful,\u201d the Vatican said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez is beloved among Venezuelans, with his face plastered on street art around Caracas, in portraits in hospitals and in photos gracing individual home altars.",
      "As a doctor in Caracas during the late 1800s and early 1900s, he refused to take money from poor people for his services and often gave them money for medicine, earning the nickname \u201cdoctor of the poor.\u201d He was killed in 1919 while crossing a street shortly after picking up some medicine at a pharmacy to bring to a poor elderly woman.",
      "He became a religious icon after his death, and when Pope John Paul II visited Venezuela in 1996, he received a petition signed by 5 million people \u2014 almost one in four Venezuelans \u2014 asking that he declare Hern\u00e1ndez a saint.",
      "\u201cFor them, this is indeed a national event of the highest order,\" said Silvia Correale, who spearheaded his sainthood case. \u201cCertainly, the canonization of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio is desired by all the Venezuelan people, and has been waited for by all the people.\u201d",
      "Jos\u00e8 Ramon Malavecontreras, a Venezuelan resident in Rome, said his mother named him after Hern\u00e1ndez and attended his canonization Sunday.",
      "\u201cThey believed I\u2019d be stillborn, so she dedicated his name to me for saving my life,\" he said Sunday. \"Therefore, this moment was unmissable for me. I couldn\u2019t fail to be here.\u201d",
      "In Caracas, Arqu\u00edmides Blanco, 60, said he wasn\u2019t a particular fan of Hern\u00e1ndez but recognized the significance of his canonization for Venezuela now. Blanco belongs to a cultural collective commissioned to paint the streets surrounding Caracas' emblematic parish of La Pastora ahead of the canonization.",
      "\u201cI may not be a big fan of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio as such, but I understand that he is Venezuelan and that his canonization in the context of the whole geopolitical situation is important,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump says he'll slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country\u2019s leader \u201cdoes nothing to stop\u201d drug production",
      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Sunday he would slash U.S. funding to Colombia because the country\u2019s leader \u201cdoes nothing to stop\u201d drug production, in what is the latest sign of friction between Washington and one of its closest allies in Latin America.",
      "In a social media post, Trump referred to Colombian President Gustavo Petro as \u201can illegal drug dealer\u201d who is \u201clow rated and very unpopular.\u201d He warned that Petro \u201cbetter close up\u201d drug operations \u201cor the United States will close them up for him, and it won\u2019t be done nicely.\u201d",
      "Trump, while at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, wrote on his Truth Social platform that Petro is \u201cstrongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields\u201d across Colombia, which the Republican president spelled as Columbia. \u201cPetro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cAS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLUMBIA,\u201d Trump said. He also said Petro had \u201ca fresh mouth toward America.\"",
      "Earlier Sunday, Petro accused the U.S. government of assassination and demanded answers after the latest American strike in Caribbean waters. The U.S. said on Saturday it was repatriating to Colombia and Ecuador two survivors from that attack, the sixth since early September. At least 29 people have been killed in strikes that the U.S. has said are targeting alleged drug traffickers.",
      "In September, the Trump administration accused Colombia of failing to cooperate in the drug war, although at the time Washington issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered aid cuts. Colombia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of cocaine, and the cultivation of the critical ingredient of coca leaves reached an all-time high last year, according to the United Nations.",
      "More recently, the State Department said it would revoke Petro\u2019s visa while he was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly because of his participation in a protest where he called on American soldiers to stop following Trump\u2019s commands. \u201cI ask all the soldiers of the United States\u2019 army, don\u2019t point your rifles against humanity\u201d and \u201cdisobey the orders of Trump,\u201d Petro said.",
      "Petro said a Colombian man was killed in a Sept. 16 strike and identified him as Alejandro Carranza, a fisherman from the coastal town of Santa Marta. He said that Carranza has no ties to drug trafficking and that his boat was malfunctioning when it was hit.",
      "\u201cU.S. government officials have committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters,\u201d Petro wrote on X. \u201cThe Colombian boat was adrift and had a distress signal on, with one engine up. We await explanations from the US government.\u201d",
      "Petro said that he has alerted the attorney general's office and demanded that it act immediately to initiate legal proceedings internationally and in U.S. courts. He continued to post a flurry of messages into early Sunday about the killing.",
      "\u201cThe United States has invaded our national territory, fired a missile to kill a humble fisherman, and destroyed his family, his children. This is Bol\u00edvar\u2019s homeland, and they are murdering his children with bombs,\u201d Petro wrote.",

      "Experts say the developments complicate state-led emergency efforts, undermining the Republican administration\u2019s stated goals of shifting more responsibility to states and local governments for disaster response.",
      "In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the new requirements were necessary because of \u201crecent population shifts\" and that changes to security grants were made \u201cto be responsive to new and urgent threats facing our nation.\u201d",

      "State emergency managers say that money has become increasingly important because the range of threats they must prepare for is expanding, including pandemics and cyberattacks.",
      "FEMA, a part of DHS, divided a $320 million Emergency Management Performance Grant among states on Sept. 29. But the next day, it told states the money was on hold until they submitted new population counts. The directive demanded that they omit people \"removed from the State pursuant to the immigration laws of the United States\u201d and to explain their methodology.",
      "The amount of money distributed to the states is based on U.S. census population data. The new requirement forcing states to submit revised counts \u201cis something we have never seen before,\u201d said Trina Sheets, executive director of the National Emergency Management Association, a group representing emergency managers. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the responsibility of emergency management to certify population.\u201d",
      "With no guidance on how to calculate the numbers, Hawaii\u2019s Amundson said staff scrambled to gather data from the 2020 census and other sources, then subtracted he number of \u201cnoncitizens\u201d based on estimates from an advocacy group.",
      "They are not sure the methodology will be accepted. But with their FEMA contacts furloughed and the grant portal down during the federal shutdown, they cannot find out. Other states said they were assessing the request or awaiting further guidance.",
      "In its statement, DHS said FEMA needs to be certain of its funding levels before awarding grant money, and that includes updates to a state's population due to deportations.",
      "Experts said delays caused by the request could most affect local governments and agencies that receive grant money passed down by states because their budgets and staffs are smaller. At the same time, FEMA also reduced the time frame that recipients have to spend the money, from three years to one. That could prevent agencies from taking on longer-term projects.",
      "Bryan Koon, president and CEO of the consulting firm IEM and a former Florida emergency management chief, said state governments and local agencies need time to adjust their budgets to any kind of changes.",

      "But Patch hopes visitors will learn something deeper from \u201cDivine Egypt,\u201d which explores how the gods were portrayed by Egyptians both royal and common, and not only in temples where only kings or priests could go, but in daily worship by ordinary people.",
      "Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted some 3,000 years; the show, which runs into January, covers all periods and features over 200 objects, from huge limestone statues to tiny golden figurines. It includes 140 works from the Met\u2019s collection, as well as others lent by museums across the globe.",
      "\u201cThe divine landscape of ancient Egypt is full of gods \u2014 actually 1,500 if you count all of them,\u201d said Patch, leading The Associated Press on a tour last week. The show focuses on 25 main deities.",
      "Even pared down to 25, the research was daunting. The material and the textual information in Egyptology is fragmentary. What's more, the Egyptians kept bringing in new gods, or giving established gods new roles. \u201cAnd so that makes it a very complex, but fascinating landscape,\u201d Patch says.",
      "One aim is to show visitors that all of these images concern \u201chow ancient Egyptians related to their world. Those gods were how they solved problems of life, death, and meaning \u2014 problems that we\u2019re still trying to solve today.\u201d",
      "Some highlights:",
      "You\u2019d think that the boy king Tutankhamun, aka King Tut, would be the star of any party, given the astounding riches from his tomb the world has come to know. But in a sculpture that first greets visitors, from the Louvre in Paris, the solar god Amun-Re sits on a throne, presenting the much smaller pharaoh beneath his knees \u2014 or rather, protecting him \u2014 with hands resting on the small shoulders. The god is identified by his feathered crown, curled beard, divine kilt and jewelry \u2014 and is definitely the main attraction. Amun-Re was worshipped at the Karnak temple complex; the presence of Re in his name links him closely to the sun.",
      "The first of five galleries, \u201cExpressing the Divine\u201d focuses on two main deities, the god Horus and goddess Hathor. Horus is always represented as a falcon with a double crown, which signifies he is the king of Egypt and linked to the living king. But Hathor, who represents fertility, music and defense, among other things, takes many forms, including a cow, an emblem, a lion-headed figure or a cobra. In one statue here, she wears cow horns and a sun disc.",
      "\u201cSo these are two main ways gods are represented: sometimes with lots of roles, sometimes with only one,\u201d Patch says.",
      "This gallery looks at the all-important Re, whose domains are the sun, creation, life and rebirth. Re often merges form with other deities. \u201cRe rules the world \u2014 he's the source of light and warmth,\u201d Patch says.",
      "He's presented in this room as a giant scarab beetle. \u201cThat's his morning aspect,\u201d Patch says. \u201cHe's seen as a beetle who takes the sun out from the underworld and pushes it up into the sky.\u201d",
      "Also here is a vivid painted relief of the goddess Maat, from the Valley of the Kings in Thebes (modern Luxor). She embodies truth, justice and social and political order. Patch notes: \u201cThe best way we translate it today is rightness. She stands for the world in rightness, the way it should work.\u201d",

      "She's standing beside a huge statue of the god Min in limestone \u2014 a headless representation of a hard-to-define god associated with vegetation, agricultural fertility and minerals.",
      "Only kings and priests could access state temples to worship their gods. What were regular folks to do?",
      "Patch explains: \u201cAt festivals, the god came out of the temple on a sacred barque (sailing vessel), and people could commune with that image in the streets, and ask him or her questions.\u201d",
      "In this room, curators have arranged a set of objects as if on a barque. At the top and center: a gleaming, solid gold statuette of Amun, which the Met purchased in 1926 from the collection of Lord Carnarvon, who was involved in the 1922 discovery of Tut\u2019s tomb.",
      "Some of the most striking art connected to Egyptian gods is about death and the afterlife. \u201cOvercoming death is something that kings and non-royals alike had to deal with,\u201d says Patch.",
      "The gods in this section include Anubis, who embalms the deceased and leads them to the afterlife; Isis and Nephthys, the sisters of Osiris, who mourn and protect the dead; and Osiris, judge and ruler of the afterlife.",
      "This gallery houses the show\u2019s signature object: a stunning statuette, on loan from the Louvre, depicting the triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. Made of gold inlaid with lapis lazuli, it shows the shrouded Osiris, falcon-headed Horus, and Isis in a sun disc and horns. The gold represents the skin of the gods, the lapis their hair.",
      "Although this last section is about overcoming death, \u201cI think you will have seen that most of the exhibition is about life,\u201d Patch notes. \u201cAnd that is what all of these deities were about. Even in overcoming death, it was about living forever.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is giving domestic automakers additional relief from tariffs on auto parts, extending what was supposed to have been a short-term rebate until 2030.",
      "It's part of a proclamation Trump signed Friday that also made official a 25% import tax on medium and heavy duty trucks, starting Nov. 1.",
      "The action reflected the administration's efforts to use tariffs to promote American manufacturing while also trying to shield the auto sector from the higher costs that Trump's import taxes have created for parts and raw materials.",
      "The special rebate initially announced in April had been set to be lowered and then expire in 2027. At the time, Trump described it as short-term aid \u201cduring this little transition\u201d with the expectation that automakers would move production lines back to the U.S.",
      "The extension and adjustments came after conversations with the auto industry, senior administration officials said. The goal is to both expand domestic production and make it more competitive. The officials insisted on anonymity as a condition for talking to reporters ahead of Trump signing the proclamation.",
      "The amended action provides a rebate of 3.75% relative to the sales price of a domestically assembled vehicle. That figure was reached by putting the 25% import tax on parts that make up 15% of a vehicle\u2019s sales price. Multiplying those two percentages together is equal to 3.75%.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is showing little urgency to broker a compromise that would end the government shutdown, even as Democrats insist no breakthrough is possible without his direct involvement.",
      "Three weeks in, Congress is at a standstill. The House hasn\u2019t been in session for a month, and senators left Washington on Thursday frustrated by the lack of progress. Republican leaders are refusing to negotiate until a short-term funding bill to reopen the government is passed, while Democrats say they won\u2019t agree without guarantees on extending health insurance subsidies.",
      "For now, Trump appears content to stay on the sidelines.",
      "He spent the week celebrating an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal he led, hosted a remembrance event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk and refocused attention on the Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, his administration has been managing the shutdown in unconventional ways, continuing to pay the troops while laying off other federal employees.",
      "Asked Thursday whether he was willing to deploy his dealmaking background on the shutdown, Trump seemed uninterested.",
      "\u201cWell, look, I mean, all we want to do is just extend. We don\u2019t want anything, we just want to extend, live with the deal they had,\u201d he said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. Later Thursday, he criticized Democratic health care demands as \u201ccrazy,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to do it.\u201d",

      "While Congress has been paralyzed by the shutdown, Trump has moved rapidly to enact his vision of the federal government.",
      "He has called budget chief Russ Vought the \u201cgrim reaper,\u201d and Vought has taken the opportunity to withhold billions of dollars for infrastructure projects and lay off thousands of federal workers, signaling that workforce reductions could become even more drastic.",
      "At the same time, the administration has acted unilaterally to fund Trump\u2019s priorities, including paying the military this week, easing pressure on what could have been one of the main deadlines to end the shutdown.",
      "Some of these moves, particularly the layoffs and funding shifts, have been criticized as illegal and are facing court challenges. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, ruling that the cuts appeared politically motivated and were carried out without sufficient justification.",
      "And with Congress focused on the funding fight, lawmakers have had little time to debate other issues.",
      "In the House, Johnson has said the House won\u2019t return until Democrats approve the funding bill and has refused to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Democrats say the move is to prevent her from becoming the 218th signature on a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on releasing documents related to the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "So far, the shutdown has shown little impact on public opinion.",

Four in 10 have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of the Republican Party, largely unchanged from last month.",

      "Legal experts say U.S. strikes against alleged members of Latin American drug cartels are pushing the bounds of international law",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Under President Donald Trump, the drug war is looking a lot like the war on terror.",
      "To support strikes against Latin American gangs and drug cartels, the Trump administration is relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which allowed U.S. authorities to use lethal force against al-Qaida combatants who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.",
      "The criminal groups now being targeted by U.S. strikes are a very different foe, however, spawned in the prisons of Venezuela, and fueled not by anti-Western ideology but by drug trafficking and other illicit enterprises.",
      "Trump\u2019s use of overwhelming military force to combat such groups and authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars say. It comes as Trump expands the military\u2019s domestic role, deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities and saying he's open to invoking the nearly 150-year-old Insurrection Act, which allows for military deployment in only exceptional instances of civil unrest.",
      "So far, the military has killed at least 27 people in five strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes \u2014 the most recent came Tuesday, in which the U.S. killed six people \u2014 have occurred without any legal investigation or a traditional declaration of war from Congress. That raises questions about the justifications for Trump's actions and the impact they could have on diplomatic relations with Latin American nations who recall with deep resentment repeated U.S. military interventions during the Cold War.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community has also disputed Trump's central claim that Maduro\u2019s administration is working with the Tren de Aragua gang and orchestrating drug trafficking and illegal immigration into the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s assertion that the United States is engaged in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels is based on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after the Sept. 11 attacks. That includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.",
      "But the United Nations charter specifically forbids the use of force except in self-defense.",
      "\u201cYou just can\u2019t call something war to give yourself war powers,\u201d said Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cHowever frustrated we may be with the means and results of law enforcement efforts to combat the flow of drugs, it makes a mockery of international law to suggest we are in a noninternational armed conflict with cartels.\u201d",
      "After 9/11, it was clear that al-Qaida was actively plotting additional attacks designed to kill civilians. But the cartels' main ambition is selling dope. And that, while harmful to American security overall, is a dubious justification for invoking war powers, said Geoffrey Corn, a Texas Tech law professor who previously served as the Army\u2019s senior adviser for law-of-war issues.",
      "\u201cThis is the government, in my humble opinion, wanting to invoke war powers for a lot of reasons\" \u2014 including political ones, Corn said.",
      "\u201cEven if we assume there\u2019s an armed conflict with Tren de Aragua, how do we know everyone in that boat was an enemy fighter?\u201d he said. \u201cI think Congress needs to know that.\u201d",
      "Asked at the White House on Wednesday why the U.S. does not use the Coast Guard to stop the Venezuelan vessels and seize any drugs, Trump replied, \u201cWe have been doing that for 30 years and it has been totally ineffective.\u201d",
      "The president also suggested the U.S. may strike targets inside Venezuela, a move that would significantly escalate tensions and the legal stakes. So far, the strikes have occurred in international waters beyond the jurisdiction of any single country.",

      "Numerous U.S. laws and executive orders since the 1970s make it illegal to assassinate foreign officials. But in declaring the Venezuelans unlawful combatants, Trump may be seeking to sidestep those restrictions and return to an earlier era in which the United States \u2014 in places like Guatemala, Chile and Iran \u2014 regularly carried out covert regime change missions.",
      "\u201cIf you pose a threat, and are making war on the U.S., you\u2019re not a protected person,\" Finkelstein said.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being \u201cone of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.\u201d",
      "But Trump's focus on Venezuela overlooks a basic fact of the drug trade: The bulk of American overdose deaths are from fentanyl, which is transported by land from Mexico. And while Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, around 75% of the cocaine produced in Colombia, the world's leader, is smuggled through the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean.",
      "Under the Constitution, it must be Congress that declares war. So far, though, there has been little indication that Trump's allies will push back on the president's expansionist view of his own power to go after cartels the White House blames for tens of thousands of American overdose deaths each year.",
      "The GOP-controlled Senate recently voted down a war powers resolution sponsored by Democrats that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes.",
      "Despite pressure even among some Republicans for a more complete account, the Trump administration has yet to provide underlying evidence to lawmakers proving that the boats targeted by the U.S. military were carrying narcotics, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said he and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in a classified briefing this month were also denied access to the Pentagon\u2019s legal opinion about whether the strikes adhered to U.S. law.",
      "Legal pushback isn't likely to sway the White House either. A Supreme Court decision arising from an attempt in 1973 by a Democratic congresswoman to sue the Pentagon to stop the spread of the Vietnam War to neighboring Laos and Cambodia set a high bar for any legal challenge of military orders, Finkelstein said.",
      "Meanwhile, relatives of the Venezuelans killed in the boat attacks face their own obstacles following several high court rulings narrowing the scope of foreign citizens to sue in the U.S.",
      "The military strikes took place in international waters, opening the door for the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation along the lines of its war crimes probes against Russia and Israel \u2014 which, like the United States, don\u2019t recognize the court\u2019s authority.",

      "Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, is scheduled to die by pentobarbital injection at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence.",
      "He pleaded guilty to murder in the deaths of couple Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who has been in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.",
      "If the execution is carried out, it will be the fourth in the country this week and the 39th of the year.",
      "Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.",
      "Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat and stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them. During Friday's execution, a team of four people including medical doctors and a phlebotomist will prepare syringes of saline and pentobarbital, insert an IV and inject the chemicals into Djerf. Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death.

(AP) \u2014 Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squabbled over a host of lawyerly issues on Thursday in their first and only debate: criminal prosecutions, consumer protection and unlawful discrimination. But one matter overshadowed it all: Jones' leaked text messages endorsing political violence toward a former colleague.",
      "Miyares, the Republican incumbent running for reelection, pushed hard against Jones for suggesting to a Republican delegate in 2022 text messages that former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get \u201ctwo bullets to the head.\u201d",
      "Referencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, Miyares started the debate by saying: \u201cCharacter is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he (Jones) was doing in the dark.\u201d",
      "Jones apologized for his words from the start.",
      "\u201cLet me be very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cI am ashamed, I am embarrassed and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d",
      "Still, the Democrat rebuffed Miyares by noting that violent rhetoric can be heard on both sides of the aisle, and that President Donald Trump has been known to use extreme language at times.",
      "\u201cWhat about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?\u201d Jones said, adding, \u201cYou haven\u2019t said a word. I\u2019ve taken accountability for my mistakes. It\u2019s time you take accountability, too.\u201d",
      "The race for attorney general of Virginia has emerged as one of the most competitive statewide contests in this year's election, with members of both parties taking an interest in the down-ballot race. Straight-ticket voting is not an option in Virginia, which requires voters to choose candidates in each statewide contest.",
      "While Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has faced setbacks in her race for governor, as has John Reid, the GOP lieutenant governor nominee, the attorney general\u2019s race remains fiercely competitive. Last week, it spilled over into the governor's race when former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, refused to say during a debate whether she still supported Jones' candidacy, suggesting it was up to the voters to decide.",
      "Jones and Miyares tangled over the violent text message for much of the debate. The way Miyares told it, Jones' texts about shooting a prominent Republican disqualified him from the race to be Virginia's lead prosecutor.",
      "Jones, in turn, spent much of his time arguing that Miyares lacked the nerve to sue the White House if the Trump administration overreached.",

      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:40:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall at his home, his agent said.",
      "Family members said in a statement\u00a0that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken.\"",
      "\"In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" Frehley's family said. \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\"",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",
      "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager, John Ostrosky, also known as John Ostronomy, said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0last month addressed to fans. Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",
      "In 2024, the band sold its catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be more than $300 million."

    "summary": "Jeremy Allen White says Bruce Springsteen encouraged him to bring his own voice for his role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.\"",
    "story": [
      "Jeremy Allen White becomes \"The Boss\" in a new film, channeling Bruce Springsteen's raw vulnerability during one of the most introspective chapters of his life.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

      "Martin-Green, who previously starred in \"Star Trek: Discovery\" and \"The Walking Dead,\" said she drew on her experience working within major television franchises.",

I didn't think 'Star Trek: Discovery' would come after 'Walking Dead,' and I certainly didn't think another beloved TV franchise would come after 'Star Trek: Discovery.' So, I've learned a lot about doing that, about building new iterations of beloved franchises,\" she said.",

However you want to refer to it. But it is a new world as well. Danny is a fish out of water and he meets someone that really is one of the reasons he stays.

    "summary": "A recent report found high levels of lead in some protein powders and shakes, but demand among U.S. consumers has soared.",
    "story": [
      "The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation Cargill. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.",
      "\"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals \u2013 they're all encouraging more protein after lifting,\" said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.",
      "The protein boom",
      "Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, according to Mintel, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights reported, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.",
      "Chains like Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that \"consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",
      "Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.",
      "\"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly,\" Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition, said.",
      "Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.",
      "But \"today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need,\" Byrne said.",
      "Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.",
      "Consumer Reports recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their investigation, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.",
      "\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"",
      "For some people \u2014 including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes \u2014 protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.",
      "\"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily,\" she said.",
      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",
      "High-protein foods",
      "\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A scientist laid off by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said \"the everyday American should be very concerned\" by reductions in force amid the government shutdown.",
      "The scientist, one of hundreds of CDC employees terminated by the Trump administration last week, asked that her identity be concealed for fear of retribution.",
      "\"It's going to mean more deaths, more preventable deaths,\" she told CBS News on Wednesday of the layoffs. \"People will absolutely die from the impact of this administration.\"",
      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

      "The recall applied to approximately 91,585 pounds of prepackaged breakfast burritos and wraps, manufactured by the California company M.C.I. Foods between Sept. 17 and Oct. 14,\u00a0said the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that focuses on public health regulations.",
      "Its announcement cited seven different types of frozen breakfast products that could be tainted. They are distributed to low-income students around the country as part of the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, which the Department of Agriculture administers. The breakfast program served more than 14 million children in 2016, and close to 30 million children participated in the lunch program in 2019, according to the department.",
      "There are no confirmed reports of illnesses tied to the recalled products, which include burritos and wraps sold by the brands El Mas Fino, Los Cabos and Midamar and contain egg, cheese and various meats like beef, ham, sausage and turkey, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The agency said it recalled those products after the manufacturer discovered listeria while conducting routine testing on egg ingredients from its external suppliers.",
      "\"FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional refrigerators of freezers,\" said the agency. \"Institutions are urged not to serve these products. These products should be thrown away.\"",
      "Listeria is an infection caused by bacteria of the same name that spreads through food. Fever, headache, stiff neck, muscle aches, confusion, loss of balance and a range of gastrointestinal problems are some of the symptoms brought on by the illness,\u00a0according to the Mayo Clinic. The clinic warns that pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of developing a harmful infection.",
      "People can be infected with listeria without becoming seriously ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has estimated that listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., with 1,250 people contracting the infection and 172 dying from the infection each year.",
      "Public health officials note that flu-like symptoms caused by listeria can signal an \"invasive\" infection, meaning one that has spread from the gastrointestinal tract, where symptoms may start, to other parts of the body. These invasive infections typically develop within two months of eating contaminated food, according to the CDC.",
      "Multiple listeria outbreaks have been reported just this month. One impacted meal kits from the food subscription service HelloFresh\u00a0and another forced the recall of nearly 245,000 pounds of precooked pasta, from the California company Nate's Fine Foods, which turned deadly and potentially contaminated dozens of different products sold in grocery stores nationwide"

      "OpenAI, the company behind generative-AI platform ChatGPT, said late Thursday on social media that it made the decision after Bernice A. King, the youngest child of King, contacted the company on behalf of his estate.",
      "At the estate's request, \"OpenAI has paused generations depicting Dr. King as it strengthens guardrails for historical figures,\" OpenAI and King Estate Inc.\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement posted on X.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 15:54:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans have received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls per month from January to September, the highest level in six years, PIRG found.",
    "story": [
      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have fully installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

    "summary": "The rush for gold continues as economic uncertainty deepens and anxious investors seek a safe haven for their money.",
    "story": [
      "As economic uncertainty deepens the rush for gold continues, with the price of the precious metal this week topping $4,300 for the first time.",
      "The going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a \"safe haven\" for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad \u2014 with President Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable.",
      "Still, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.",
      "Gold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 \u2014 trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That's up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.",
      "Silver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of this year's economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market.",
      "As a result, hiring has plunged\u00a0while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.",
      "Separately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point \u2014 and projected it would do so twice more this year.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there's been strong gold demand from central banks around the world \u2014 particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "And on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency \u2014 with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.",
      "Gold jewelry sticker shock",
      "Many jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own \u2014 sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal's rising price.",
      "At the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling \"sticker shock\" if they can't afford certain products anymore \u2014 particularly if it's something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.",
      "Larger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.",
      "Advocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven \u2014 arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic\u00a0growth has accelerated\u00a0in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell recently told CBS News.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment.",
      "Not always a reliable inflation hedge",
      "Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,\" the commission noted.",
      "The frenzy for gold has also resulted in health and environmental consequences \u2014 with officials pointing to rising demand for mercury, a toxic metal that is key in illegal gold mining worldwide.",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during artisanal or small-scale mining. But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people's bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks \u2014 putting in danger workers who rely on the industry, as well as residents in affected areas more broadly.",
      "The Associated Press has reported about the effects of mercury poisoning tied to gold mining in countries like Senegal, Mexico and Peru, among other parts of the world."

      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:35:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A new scam involves fake letters that appear to be from U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts \u2014 but it's a ploy to trick seniors, agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "It looks official \u2014 a letter stamped with the U.S. Supreme Court seal, signed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, warning that you're under investigation. But it's a scam \u2014 one designed to steal money from Social Security recipients, according to the agency's watchdog division.",
      "The fake SCOTUS letter prompted an Oct. 8 warning from the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General, cautioning the program's 75 million beneficiaries to be on alert if they receive a purported letter from the nation's highest court.",
      "While the warning didn't disclose how many Social Security recipients have been targeted by the fraud, the watchdog group said the hoax marks the evolution of government imposter scams, such as the decade-old scheme in which criminals\u00a0pretend to be IRS officials\u00a0informing their target victims that they're under investigation for tax fraud. The threat of an IRS probe has long been used by scammers to scare individuals into providing money or private data such as Social Security numbers.",
      "In this latest version of the same scheme, fraudsters are impersonating Supreme Court justices, rather than IRS officials. The new scam relies on multiple points of contact, with a fake letter followed by a text or call from the fraudsters, making it appear more authentic, said John Haraburda, Transaction Network Services (TNS) robocall data expert and director of product management.",
      "\"The fraudsters get very, very smart,\" Haraburda said. \"They do the mailing, then they'll send you a text from the number they're going to use for the phone call saying, 'This is the Social Security Administration \u2014 we're going to be calling you from this number in a few seconds.'\"",
      "He added, \"Then you've got this text message in a way authenticating the call that's coming in. That lets you break down your hesitation, to basically drop your guard.\"",
      "According to the Social Security Inspector General, the scam letter is personally addressed to the would-be victim, warning that they're a suspect in connection with legal proceedings and criminal charges. It also falsely claims their Social Security number has been compromised.",
      "The fake letter goes on to say that the Supreme Court has requested financial institutions to freeze the recipient's assets, and urges them to cooperate with \"the U.S. Treasury Department,\" the watchdog agency said.",
      "\"The letter ominously closes by stating, should the recipient encounter any difficulties in safeguarding assets, the recipient will bear full liability for any losses incurred following the suspension of their SSN,\" the SSA's inspector general said. \"Scammers most likely will follow up with text messages or telephone calls.\"",
      "Scammers may follow up with a text that includes a link to a fake Social Security site, which will capture the victim's login and password as they attempt to gain access to their accounts, or might ask for credit card info, Haraburda said.",
      "Never click on a link in an email or text that purports to be from an official, he noted. Instead, go directly to the Social Security site \u2014 https://www.ssa.gov \u2014 to log in.",
      "\"On every level, this letter is completely false,\" Michelle L. Anderson, acting inspector general at the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General said in a statement. \"These criminals are falsely accusing an individual of a crime and using federal agencies and federal officials to try to scare and legitimize their scam \u2014 if you get this type of letter, rip it up and report it.\""

      "Other forecasts show broader spending is expected to hold up this holiday season, a critical period for retailers. Consumers plan to spend an average of roughly $890 each on holiday gifts, food, decorations and other seasonal items, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "Although that's a dip from the nearly $902 people spent last year, it still represents the second-highest figure since the trade group started tracking holiday spending more than two decades ago."

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

    "summary": "Despite delays at some airports caused by staff shortages, government officials and aviation experts say flying is safe.",
    "story": [
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports during the U.S. government shutdown may have travelers wondering if they have anything to worry about as they board their flight.",
      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed potential safety concerns during the shutdown on Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure that when you travel you travel safely, and so if we don't have controllers necessary to keep you safe, we slow it down,\" he told the network.",
      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "States are battling for their piece of $50 billion in federal rural health funding, but it's not just hospitals vying for the money. Tech startups and policy demands are raising the stakes as Medicaid cuts loom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.",
      "Rather, states should submit applications that \"rebuild and reshape\" how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at D.C.'s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors' office staffers and state health agency leaders \u2014 some from as far away as Hawaii.",
      "\"This isn't a backfill of operating budgets,\" said Sutton, CMS' innovation director. \"We've been really clear on that.\"",
      "Rural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Trump's massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill's financial fallout for rural hospitals.",
      "Yet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency's leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.",
      "It's \"what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,\" said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.",
      "Applications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.",
      "Half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "The application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as \"symptom checkers and AI chatbots.\"",
      "In September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money \"will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.\"",
      "Smaller hospitals fear they will get \"a tiny little slice\" of each state's share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.",
      "\"There's a lot of frustration,\" Felder said.",
      "But Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet \"is really just throwing good money after bad.\" In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.",
      "One of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.",
      "The company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.",
      "\"They're doing their job, and they're talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,\" Schneider said. \"We're one of many in that position.\"",
      "KFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was \"unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.\"",
      "Instead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program \"will help states and communities reimagine what's possible for rural healthcare.\"",
      "Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn't \"sexy\" or \"revolutionary.\"",
      "\"If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don't think that's transformational,\" Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.",
      "Slabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money \u2014 including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating \"SWAT\" teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.",
      "More than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 \u2014 a statistic cited by CMS' Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.",
      "State applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.",
      "\"We will train them in the scoring criteria,\" Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from \"your state\" and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.",
      "States are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.",
      "In Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.",
      "\"It's one-time money, and it's a little bit of money,\" said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.",
      "\"How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?\" Mark said.",
      "Neither Montana nor Wyoming \u2014 vast, rural states \u2014 sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.",
      "Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were \"stretched with other commitments.\" Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.",
      "During the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.",
      "\"I think Arkansas' application is going to be better than yours,\" seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.",
      "The audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee's Bill Lee.",
      "\"See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,\" Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, \"I look forward to us both winning.\"",
      "KFF Health News Montana correspondent Katheryn Houghton contributed to this report.",

      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",

      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",

      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS.

      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

      "Federal prosecutors claim Chen Zhi, the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, oversaw a vast criminal network in Cambodia built on forced labor that extracted billions from victims in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "The indictment, which was unsealed in a\u00a0federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday, charges the 37-year-old Cambodian national with wire fraud and money laundering.",
      "\"By dismantling a criminal empire built on forced labor and deception, we are sending a clear message that the United States will use every tool at its disposal to defend victims, recover stolen assets and bring to justice those who exploit the vulnerable for profit,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement.",
      "The complaint is the largest forfeiture action in the history of the Department of Justice, according to the agency.",
      "Chen remains at large, according to the Justice Department. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison.",
      "\"Today the FBI and partners executed one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement. \"This is an individual who allegedly operated a vast criminal network across multiple continents involving forced labor, money laundering, investment schemes, and stolen assets \u2014 targeting millions of innocent victims in the process.\"",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control\u00a0announced Tuesday that it has coordinated with U.K. officials to impose sweeping sanctions against 146 entities associated with the Prince Group, which has been formally designated a transnational criminal organization by the department.",
      "Prince Holding Group's website lists it as one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia, with businesses focused on real estate development, banking, finance and consumer services.",

      "The Justice Department alleges the criminal network convinced victims over social media and messaging apps to transfer cryptocurrency based on the false promises that it would be invested. The scammers then stole the funds, laundered them and used the proceeds for luxury travel, entertainment and other extravagant purchases, according to the agency.",
      "Allegations of human trafficking",
      "Federal prosecutors said Prince Group targeted victims around the world with assistance from local networks, including one operated from Brooklyn, New York. To carry out the schemes, the criminal actors allegedly trafficked hundreds of people and forced them to work in a network of compounds across Cambodia. The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",
      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",
      "Mark Taylor, who formerly worked on human trafficking issues in Cambodia for the nonprofit Winrock International, said that Chen was embedded in the Cambodian elite and \"well protected\" by the government, showing \"the larger role that Cambodia has played as a safe center for this online scamming to prosper.\" Chen was formerly a personal adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.",
      "\"Cambodia is the physical location where a lot of it operates, but it's also the money laundering center for the entire region,\" Taylor said",
      "Independent research group Cyber Scam Monitor has documented more than 200 online scamming centers and casinos in Cambodia alone, based on first-hand accounts from former scam workers, field surveys and media reports."

      "\"There was no impact to any movements and no individuals were present or involved at the location,\" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News that the hunting stand was across a highway in a tree line more than 200 yards away and had apparently been there for months, based on its condition. Mr. Trump was not using that part of the airport in the past year due to construction, so it would not have had a direct line of sight to Mr. Trump and was not part of the Secret Service's sweeps of the site",
      "Once construction ended, Air Force One started using that area of the airport again, and the stand was discovered by the Secret Service right away in its initial sweeps, the sources said.",

      "Hegseth said Friday's strike targeted a boat linked to Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group that the U.S. has considered a terrorist organization since the 1990s. He alleged in a post on X that the boat \"was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics.\"",

      "\"The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are\u2014they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" President Trump told reporters last week.",
      "The strikes have drawn some pushback from lawmakers who have pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, and argue the administration hasn't made the case that the attacks are legally permitted.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believed the legal justification offered to members of Congress was \"very convoluted.\"",

      "Israel and Gaza implemented the first phase of President Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0last week, with a ceasefire taking effect in Gaza after Israeli troops pulled back to a predetermined line. Since then, Hamas has released 20 living hostages and the remains of 12 others. Meanwhile, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who have been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",

      "And Putin has a conversation with him and those weapons are now off the table. Hey, I think Ukraine can handle \u2013 if we can give them enough rounds, if we have them in our inventory and enough launchers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Ground launchers are rather new to the system, something we got rid of for a long period of time.",
      "They have demonstrated their ability to operate a sophisticated weapon system like the F-16. They could handle this, and it would help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Zelenskyy says they're going to continue to try to persuade President Trump.",
      "I have to ask you about the shutdown. The Republican leader, John Thune, has offered to sit down with Democrats to discuss Obamacare, but on the condition that Democrats end the shutdown. He posted this on social media.",
      "Can you bank this as a win and agree to start negotiations?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: That's what we want. We want negotiations on how to fix\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this enough?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 how to \u2013 I didn't look at his tweet, but what we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium.",
      "They're going to go up on November 1 for people. They can't afford it. People in my state\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Either way, they're going up .",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I have talked to so many people.",
      "This woman Emily (sp?), whose husband's a pastor, who has three kids, says, without the Affordable Care Act, she cannot have insurance for her children. They don't get it through his work. So what we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you need to do that before November 1, when premiums go up?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to end the shutdown before November 1?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I would like to. I would like to \u2013 we should \u2013 we could \u2013 we should be able to wrap this up this week if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us.",
      "The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress.",

      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: The president has said he wants to fix this premium thing and he wants the government open. That's what we want.",

      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT (R-Alabama): Thank you so much for having me, Margaret. I appreciate it. Look forward to being on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about a lot of things, but let me just pick up where Senator Kelly left off on the shutdown.",
      "He said, hey, you could all hash this out this week. Leader Thune made that offer. I know you have said you also are concerned insurance premiums are going to go up, whether Congress extends the tax credits related to Obamacare that Democrats are campaigning for or not here, basically.",
      "Do you want this extended?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: First off, Margaret, we need to reopen the government. Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing.",
      "Just as I have been traveling the state this weekend, I have heard countless stories of people who are not getting a paycheck, whether it's our men and women in uniform or those who serve alongside them, or whether we're talking to veterans or we're talking to just a number of people, when we're looking what's happening with WIC.",
      "There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people. And so getting the government open is number one. So we need to vote on this C.R. and open the government back up.",
      "We have also given alternatives like end government shutdown. And I think you will see this week, if the Democrats don't come to the table, saying, look, a Shutdown Fairness Act, making sure that the people who are working are actually getting paychecks, because, Margaret, these have real consequences for American people.",
      "And when we're talking about the ACA, look, Leader Thune said it best. We have always said we will have a conversation about this. We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible.",
      "They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do personally think the federal government should be offsetting some of these costs? Because we looked at the numbers, and I think it's like 130,000 Alabamans are at risk of losing insurance if the tax credit goes away.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, let's be honest about this. Let's go back to Obamacare, 2010.",
      "This is the Affordable Air \u2013 Affordable Care Act that even \"The Washington Post\" has said was never really affordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: You go to 2014, and what you see there though was increases made by the Democrats.",
      "And then these increases that we're talking about right now, insurance companies have said only account for about 4 percent of what they're talking about increasing in 2026. The underlying issue is the brokenness of Obamacare. That is the problem.",
      "And so, when you think about this, you have got the 2021 premiums that they have given to everyone. Do you understand Democrats are actually asking for us to continue premiums that are going to millionaires in some cases? We have got to be more \u2013 more responsible with taxpayer dollars.",
      "And if you want these health care systems to even be able to work, then we have to have a larger conversation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: But this is absolutely, totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.",
      "Those two things do not match up. And Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open. And we're happy to have conversations, as we have always said, just as Leader Thune reiterated this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Oval Office discussing another health care matter with President Trump this past week.",
      "He credited you with announcing \u2013 well, basically explaining to him that February 2024 decision by an Alabama court that ruled frozen embryos are children. He called it a bad decision, and we all probably remember what it did for those families trying to go through fertilization treatment at that time.",
      "With the changes that were announced, who's going to be able to afford this now?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, millions more people are going to be able to afford this because of President Trump's leadership.",
      "From the very first time I talked to him about this, Margaret, he has been steadfast and unwavering, understanding that there are people from coast to coast that have been praying to be able to start their family or expand their family.",
      "And because of infertility, here in the United States, we have seen one in eight families that are actually struggling with infertility issues. We have got about 9 percent of men, 11 percent of women who are facing these challenges.",
      "President Trump believes in being obviously the president that is helping hardworking Americans, helping parents, helping families. He's turned the Republican Party into that, which is so exciting. And we want to make sure that they're going to be able to do that at a greater scale.",
      "And so that's exactly what this will do. Millions more will have access. And, additionally, we're going to drive the costs down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so I talked this weekend actually with a friend of mine who came up to me and said, \"I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this,\" because the affordability issue was the impediment.",
      "And she actually had to go off \u2013 off \u2013 off \u2013 over shores\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 overseas to try to be able to bring life into this world. So it's exciting for people like her.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And I have had grandparents and parents and moms and dads tell me what a game changer this is for them as they start and grow their family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one cycle of IVF can cost between $15,000 to $20,000, and lower-income women obviously have a challenge with that.",
      "But, during the campaign, President Trump said he was going to make the government pay for it or make insurance companies pay for it. So do you think that the Affordable Care Act, that Obamacare, for example, should cover it, or is it too controversial for conservatives, who have a moral issue with IVF?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, Margaret, first, I mean, the Affordable Care Act is broken. And that is what we're seeing right now. I mean, you have seen the increases that people will see in 2026, 80 percent of those are just Obamacare, Affordable Care Act-related.",
      "And so we clearly see that the underlying structure of this program is not sustainable and is not working for the American people. No one is paying less now that Obamacare is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: And so we have got to be super honest about that.",
      "We also have to make sure that we're being responsible moving forward. What President Trump has done is made this accessible to millions more people. He's going to continue leading on this issue and so many others\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's still not free. It's still not free, right?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and actually support hardworking families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you want to legislate, though, to force it to be?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Well, and what we're doing too \u2013 what I want to do is, I want as many people as possible to have opportunity to bring life into this world, and that's exactly what this is doing.",
      "We will continue to work on this issue. We also want to support families as they have children and are able to \u2013 in this environment right now, we hear from people all the time, whether it is bringing life into this world, whether it is the childcare cost, just the affordability aspect.",
      "And I am so proud to see President Trump lead on these. Actually, if you look at the Working Families Tax Cut, Margaret, this is the very first time we have actually increased the childcare tax credits\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 and also the DCAP tax credits in 20 years in some instances and 40 in others.",
      "So we're trying to make sure that people can not only bring life into this world, but that it's more affordable when they get here, because we want people to start and grow their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really\u2026",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: That's what this is doing. This is just the start, and look forward to continuing to work for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really quickly, you have been trying to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for stealing Ukrainian children.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the president's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin endanger your efforts to get this bill passed?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, I am grateful for President Trump's efforts on this.",
      "If you look back, we are in this war because of President Biden. If President Biden had sent the weaponry needed to Ukraine on the front end, when we saw Russia building up, we wouldn't be in this war to start with. When you're looking at what President Trump has done, he has met with Zelenskyy more times in his nine months in office\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: \u2026 than President Biden did his entire time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you have support to bring it to the floor?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: So, these conversations help us to have resolution.",
      "The \u2013 the \u2013 well, the first lady obviously has been leading on this. We have built up support. We're having a hearing next week. I think you will see this come to the floor if there is not a resolution in the short order, because we believe in bringing these children home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, it's about 20,000 children that have been stolen from their homes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Transformation, I think caused by a couple of things. One is the tariffs, which have changed the map of trade around the world and reconstituted new alliances and reformed the way in which we trade with each other. I think the second major transformation is the impact of artificial intelligence on everything we do from data management to dating and everything in between.",

      "We return to our conversation with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde.",
      "You said the economy is this transformation. S&P global forecasts, Trump's tariffs are going to cost global businesses upwards of $1.2 trillion this year with a lot of the costs passed along to consumers themselves.",
      "You've said that many economists overestimated the impact of Trump's tariffs. Does that mean you think we've moved past the point of risk, or are we yet to feel the pain?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE (President, European Central Bank): I think we're yet to feel the pain. What we observe \u2013 I'll give you some numbers. From Europe to the United States, our goods to the U.S. consumers had a tariff of 1.5. With the tariff that was decided by the U.S. administration, it's gone up to 13 percent. So, the question is, where does this additional 11-ish percentage point go? At the moment, it's one-third on the exporter, so the European company, one-third of the U.S. importer, and one-third of the consumer.",
      "What will happen, though, is that these two-thirds born by two corporates essentially, the exporter and the importer, is based on the squeeze of the margins. How long are they going to put up with the squeeze of the margin? To be seen. And when they don't, because it's becoming too tight, then it will be on the consumer. So, it's a question of time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much they can stomach the hit to their own profits before passing it along?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are talks happening we understand between the world's two largest economies. The Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on social media he's going to meet with China's vice premiere in the coming days. This was after he called the negotiator unhinged recently, and President Trump said that starting November 1st there will be new tariffs as retaliation for Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. These are the largest economies in the world. Where does this go? How damaging does this get?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I would discount a little bit of the positioning at the moment because this is typical of negotiating tactics on both sides. Typical. You show your muscles and you say that you are ready to kill. I'm exaggerating, of course.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: But people will have to come to the table because it's the interest of both economies, despite the hostility that there is between the two.",
      "But China is using an advantage that it has built over the course of time by accumulating rare earth and the ways to refine rare earth and then to sell it to the rest of the world. They have very, very strong trading position on that front, and they're going to use it, which is why I think that on the other side, the consumers, that is the United States, Europe and a few other countries around the world, we should, you know, join forces and be a purchasing force on the other side of the table of a selling force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly to that point, there has been frustration on the American side of it that Europe hasn't been standing lockstep with the United States when it comes to China. That China has leverage over Europe here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, China currently has leverage against most countries that consume rare earth. And I think on the front of rare earth, the Europeans and the Americans are in the same boat, and they are rowing in the same direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's other items that you see space (ph) on?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, I think, you know, it's not for me to say. I'm just a central banker. But the \u2013 the European authorities and the U.S. administration see it slightly differently. I think it's the \u2013 the U.S. would see a blanket force. I think the Europeans are more interested in targeting specific industries or specific sectors where they think that it will make a difference. So, it's a question of tactics that they will be discussing, I'm sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have also said recently that you think investors have begun to question what the dollar would still warrant its status at the ultimate safe haven currency. I mean the American dollar is one of the strongest weapons, frankly, that \u2013 that the administration has to use.",
      "Do you think that it is the rise of cryptocurrency that is most threatening to that, or why are you worried?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see signs that the \u2013 the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded. And future will tell whether there is more erosion of that. But when you look at the rise of crypto is number one. When you look at the price of gold. Gold is typically in any situation the ultimate destination for safe haven. Price of gold has increased by more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people are worried (ph) \u2013",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: That's a clear sign that the trust in the reserve currency that the dollar has been is and will continue to be is eroding a bit.",
      "Now, in addition to that, we've seen capital flows outside of the U.S. towards other destinations, including Europe. So, you know, for a currency to be really trusted, you need a few things. You need geopolitical credibility. You need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need, I would call it a military force that is strong enough. I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position. But it needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time. We've seen it with the sterling pound, you know, way back after the \u2013 after the war. But it happens gently, gently, you don't notice it, and then it happens suddenly. And we are seeing intriguing signs of it, which is why I think that having a strong institution with the Fed, for instance, is important. Having a credible environment within which to trade is important. So, volatility, uncertainty to the extent it is fueled by the administration is not helpful to the dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, quickly on Ukraine. President Zelenskyy said he spoke to you recently about using frozen Russian assets. What is fair use in your view?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think fair use would consist of an operational loan that would be using cash balances as collaterals. And I think that the strength of the system should be based on everyone holding Russian assets to do the same thing. So, if all those countries holding assets that have cash balances available as collaterals go in the same direction of lending the money to Ukraine, to be repaid by Russian financing of the reconstruction of Ukraine, because Russia is the aggressor, then I think that that would go a long way in convincing Russia that it has to come to the table to negotiate.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to higher education. Universities are resisting the Trump administration's proposal to reward schools that commit to President Trump's priorities. The White House has requested that nine universities sign a nine-page compact or risk forgoing federal benefits. Tomorrow is the deadline for feedback. And so far, not one college has agreed to sign and at least six have rejected it.",
      "The compact, reviewed by CBS News, states that universities pledge not to use race or sex in admissions and hiring, freeze tuition for five years, cap international enrollment at 15 percent and require standardized testing.",
      "There's also a pledge for all employees to abstain from speech related to politics.",
      "On Thursday, we spoke with three professors who represent the views of their respective faculties. Jeri Seidman of the University of Virginia, Leila Hudson of the University of Arizona, the Miki Turner the University of Southern California. We began by asking about the administration's request for schools to create an environment that doesn't, quote, \"punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas.\"",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "JERI SEIDMAN (Professor, University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce): So, belittling speech is obviously not something that any university would want. However, as a state university, we are required to abide by the Constitution. And so, while a private university could decide to limit the free speech of faculty, staff or students if that university decided to, as a state institution, nobody can require the University of Virginia to limit the free speech or any other constitutional right of faculty, staff or students.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Professor Hudson and Professor Turner, how do you all think your university is going to interpret that kind of guidance? Do you think, first of all, that that is happening on your campuses? And then, how is that supposed to be regulated with this federal mandate?",
      "MIKI TURNER (Professor, USC Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism: I am on a task force, a provost (ph) task for academic freedom. Academic freedom and freedom of speech are two different things. But what we're working toward is to, you know, find that common ground between academic freedom, what professors and students can or cannot do in the classroom. And I don't think that this initiative will happen at USC. I can't \u2013 I can't see a situation where we would want to limit what we say, how we say it, and what we do as a university.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, can you go back to this idea that is being introduced here, that in the view of the Trump administration, this is actually a problem that needs to be fixed, that there is belittling or violence against conservative ideas on university campuses.",
      "LEILA HUDSON (Professor, University of Arizona School of Middle Eastern and North Africa Studies): Well, I would push back against that. Again, as a public research university, we are an open marketplace, if you will, of ideas. So, you're going to hear all kinds of speech. We have institutional rules that prevent harassment and certainly violence.",
      "But in terms of trying to regulate the speech, that, indeed, will violate, not only the academic freedom that makes our universities great, but the constitutional rights of the university community.",
      "So, I think that, again, this will require a lot more discussion and, indeed, resistance. And I've been very heartened, both on our campus and across the country, to see people rising up against anything that would silence any voices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the specific accusation that there's a problem of, you know, belittling and sparking violence against conservative ideas, do any of you object to trying to counter that, or is it that none of you believe that that's actually even a real problem?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: The University of Virginia has taken the ability of people to cordially or speak to each other with courtesy but differing opinions very seriously. And we have a number of initiatives on grounds to try to advance that. So, we definitely think it's something important and we want to make sure that those, you know, isn't happening on our campuses. I don't think it's happening to the extent that it gets reported.",
      "But the thing that's really important is that each university should determine how those are implemented on their universities, what their issues are and have the decentralized decision-making ability to decide whether their university has an issue and how to deal with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, you were talking about the open marketplace of ideas here. And that is referring to the language in the compact that talks about the need to foster \"a vibrant brant marketplace of ideas.\" But in these terms, it's suggesting that that doesn't exist. That the overwhelming, you know, persuasion of the professors on campus are liberal. That seems to be the accusation here. Do you deny that that is an issue?",
      "LEILA HUDSON: Well, I don't think it's an issue that the federal government needs to weigh in on or any other level of government. Indeed, we have traditions, we have understandings, we have an ironclad commitment to the principles of free speech that mean that any systematic or chronic silencing of any individual's voice or perspective would immediately be identified and rectified by more speech, not by government intervention. So, I'm very comfortable that we can continue to improve climate on campus. But the act of introducing government regulation into that absolutely undermines and sabotages that project.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, in terms of where the Trump administration's compact came from, there were a lot of influences. But one of them, according to the man himself, is billionaire Mark Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management. And he said he helped write the compact because \"without government involvement, reform at universities will be difficult,\" he argues. He says there have been \"government mandates\" on things like \"diversity, on discrimination and student discipline,\" so why view these at any different?",
      "Why is he wrong?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: We were talking about academic freedom. And I think in our ability to search for the truth in research, we also have responsibilities in the classroom that are different than you would experience in a corporate setting. And so, I read the compact differently than he does. I think the thing that I struggle with the most about the compact is the idea that it rewards loyalty as opposed to focuses on advancement of the truth.",
      "As a cancer survivor, I want federal research funds to go to the universities and the professors who have the best ideas to cure cancer. That's the way to advance knowledge. And academics, that's really \u2013 we are truth seekers. The compact says, you know, truth seeking is a core foundation of institutions of higher education. And I completely agree with that portion of the compact, it's just the implementation of that truth seeking that I think we differ on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the \u2013 the compact says that if this proposal is not signed on to by the university, they may choose to \"forgo federal benefits.\" If you do sign on, there's a chance of increased funding and federal partnerships. So, it's not explicitly threatened, but it's strongly suggested that that would be the consequence. That's how \u2013 how your \u2013 how the university understands it?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: That's how I believe most faculty understand it that I have heard from.",
      "Something interesting is that, even faculty who have grants have reached out to me and said, you know, we \u2013 we want the grants to go to the places that have the best ideas. We don't want to have special treatment. Faculty are truth seekers. And so, we don't \u2013 we don't want special benefits. Even if that means that our university is not favored because others do sign on, we all want the best ideas to be advanced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the state government front, there's also pressure at - - in Virginia and in California. In Virginia, Democrats in the state Senate wrote, \"if UVA signs this thing, there will be significant consequences in future budget cycles. Out in California, Professor Turner, Governor Newsom vowed to cut off billions in state funding if anyone signs this thing. And the White House says that's like California\"endorsing discrimination, tuition hikes and confronting speech with violence.\" If you're between those two pressure points, what do you do?",
      "MIKI TURNER: That's \u2013 that's a great question because I really have complete empathy for our college presidents who have to deal with this situation right now because they are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because of all this political ping-pong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, on the pressure from the Democrats in the state of Virginia, is that helping or is that hurting?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Pressure from both sides definitely feel \u2013 definitely feels it.",
      "I think the difference between the pressure from the state level and the pressure from the federal level is the state funds that come from the university are the university's to determine how they use. The federal funds that we get are either for students for financial aid or are for specific grants. So, the threats to remove funding are a little bit different in that regard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Turner, one of the things that got a lot of attention from both parties during the campaign was also just the high cost of college and university tuition right now.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: USC is the highest tuition of any private university in this country. We were looking at it before. And I was floored. It cost $75,000 a year in tuition. It gets close to $99,000 a year, inclusive of expenses. There are a lot of parents who would hear, oh, a five-year freeze in tuition and be glad that it went into effect.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Exactly. And that's one of the components I'm in agreement with, about the freeze on tuition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it also wants to cap the number of international students that you have, which would impact USC because you're above that 15 percent threshold.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does one premise fight the other? Can \u2013 can you bring the cost down if you cut out the university students who are paying full boat coming from overseas?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Not at all. Not at all. We would not be able to do that because, you know, they \u2013 they essentially come with cash in hand. And not only that, do they add to the financial pot, but they also add to the collective perspective. And so, we want those students there from every country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to bring up one of the things that was raised here, and that is, we know the Supreme Court struck down race-based admissions. One of the first points in this compact addresses the issue of preferential treatment, as they refer to it, based on identity. They list, sex, nationality, gender, religion, race or political views.",
      "Professor Turner, you work on recruitment, I understand. How does this impact recruiting students?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Yes. If that goes into effect, that's going to affect the way I do things. But I don't think that it's going to have a huge impact on the way USC really does things. You know, we actively recruit, you know, students from all walks of life, of all races. And I don't think that, you know, we should stop that because, again, you know, we're thinking about these students. And we're thinking about their growth and how they are going to go out into the world and change this world for the better. And to \u2013 in order to do that, they need to engage with different types of people with different cultures. And so, hopefully, you know, this won't have that impact on our school because, you know, if we can't \u2013 we really can't afford to have that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, the University of Virginia's president was forced to resign because of a Department of Justice investigation related to DEI commitments. Do you get any indication that the federal pressure on UVA is going to go away?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Two of our open investigations with the Department of Justice that related to admissions around DEI have been closed. So, that is good news. And those were closed based on information we provided that apparently satisfied the concerns about race being used in admission.",
      "I think this particular item of the compact would impact UVA. UVA has always had a very holistic approach to admissions. We find talent to be much broader than just test scores and grades.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Since we spoke with the three professors, USC and the University of Virginia have rejected the compact. No word yet from the University of Arizona.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For the first time in decades, CBS News is no longer reporting from inside the Pentagon. Our reporters, alongside those from dozens of networks, newspapers and wire services emptied out their booths and workspaces this past week. The journalists exited rather than agree to a 21-page list of new restrictions which would prevent them from soliciting information that has not been pre-approved by the government.",
      "The Department of War, as the current administration calls it, has a $1 trillion budget and employed 3 million military and civilian employees. CBS will continue to report from outside the building, but journalists will no longer have the day-to-day, face-to-face contact with the military that helps the public understand what U.S. troops are facing.",
      "Secretary Hegseth once promised the most transparent administration ever. But as one former defense official told us, \"The American people are going to know a lot less about what their Department of War is doing.\"",
      "That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week. For \"FACE THE NATION,\" I'm Margaret Brennan.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:52:31 -0400",
    "summary": "Democrats and Republicans remain dug in on their positions on Day 19 of the government shutdown, which has become the third-longest funding lapse in modern history.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said Sunday that lawmakers could resolve the shutdown stalemate and reopen the government as soon as this week, urging Republicans to come to the negotiating table on health care subsidies.",
      "\"We should be able to wrap this up this week, if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us,\" Kelly said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama pressed Democrats to \"do the right thing\" and reopen the government first.",
      "Democrats and Republicans remain dug in on their positions on Day 19 of the government shutdown, which has become the\u00a0third-longest funding lapse\u00a0in modern history. Last week, an effort to advance a House-passed measure to fund the government fell short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate for a tenth time, as Republicans sought to peel off support from Democrats. But they've been unable to win over additional support since the shutdown began, as most Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government.",
      "Republicans in Congress have insisted that there's nothing to negotiate as Democrats have sought to sit down with GOP leaders and the president. Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that he's told Democrats he's willing to guarantee a vote on the tax credits, though he can't guarantee an outcome. And in a post on X Friday, the South Dakota Republican added that he's willing to sit down with Democrats on the health care issue, but only under the condition that the shutdown ends.",
      "Kelly reiterated Democrats' position Sunday, saying, \"we want negotiations.\"",
      "\"What we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium \u2014 they're going to go up on Nov. 1 for people,\" the Arizona Democrat said, referring to an expected jump in health insurance premiums if Congress doesn't extend a set of enhanced tax credits. \"What we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.\"",
      "Though there have been conversations between lawmakers about how to reopen the government, congressional leaders have not met since the shutdown began, last gathering on Sept. 29 for a meeting with President Trump at the White House.",
      "\"The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress. That's it, one hour,\" Kelly said. \"They need to get in the room and stay in a room until we can hash this out. The president has said he wants to fix this premium thing, and he wants the government open. That's what we want.\"",
      "Sen. Britt: Democrats need to \"do the right thing\"",
      "Britt, who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said, \"Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people,\" Britt said. \"And so getting the government open is number one.\"",
      "On extending the health insurance tax credits, Britt reiterated that Republicans are willing to discuss the issue, but only once the government is reopened.",
      "\"We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible,\" Britt said. \"They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.\"",
      "Britt said it's \"absolutely totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.\"",
      "\"Those two things do not match up, and Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open,\" she added."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 19, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde. The ECB sets interest rates for many countries in the European Union, which is America's largest trading partner. Good to have you here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Lovely to be back, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: From where you sit, how would you describe the state of the global economy?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: In transformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transformation.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Transformation, I think caused by a couple of things. One is the tariffs, which have changed the map of trade around the world and reconstituted new alliances and reformed the way in which we trade with each other. I think the second major transformation is the impact of artificial intelligence on everything we do from data management to dating and everything in between.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely, and it's changing how we even receive the data itself --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- Yep. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- to indicate what's happening, but the stock market has been up and down. I want to talk to you on the other side of this commercial break about some of the specifics with these trade wars and what else you're seeing in Europe, but we're going to take a quick break here. And we have more questions, but we have to come back in just one moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We return to our conversation with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. You said the economy is in transformation. S&P Global forecasts Trump's tariffs are going to cost global businesses upwards of $1.2 trillion this year, with a lot of those costs passed along to consumers themselves. You've said that many economists overestimated the impact of Trump's tariffs. Does that mean you think we've moved past the point of risk or are we yet to feel the pain?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think we're yet to feel the pain. What we observe, I'll give you some numbers. From Europe to the United States, our goods to the U.S. consumers had a tariff of 1.5. With the tariff that was decided by the U.S. administration, it's gone up to 13%. So the question is, where does this additional 11-ish percentage point go? At the moment, it's one-third on the exporter, so the European company, one-third of the U.S. importer and one-third of the consumer. What will happen, though, is that these two-thirds borne by two corporates, essentially, the exporter and the importer, is based on a squeeze of their margins. How long are they going to put up with a squeeze of the margin, to be seen. And when they don't, because it's becoming too tight, then it will be on the consumer. So it's a question of time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much they can stomach the hit --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- Yep. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- to their own profits before passing that along. Well, there are talks happening, we understand, between the world's two largest economies. The Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on social media he's going to meet with China's Vice Premier in the coming days. This was after he called the negotiator unhinged recently, and President Trump said that starting November 1st there will be new tariffs as retaliation for Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. These are the largest economies in the world. Where does this go? How damaging does this get?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I would discount a little bit of the positioning at the moment because this is typical of negotiating tactics on both sides. Typical. You show your muscles and you say that you're ready to kill. I'm exaggerating, of course. But people will have to come to the table because it's the interest of both economies, despite the hostility that there is between the two. But China is using an advantage that it has built over the course of time by accumulating rare earth and the ways to refine rare earth and then to sell it to the rest of the world. They have a very, very strong trading position on that front and they're going to use it, which is why I think that on the other side the consumers, that is the United States, Europe and a few other countries around the world, we should, you know, join forces and be a purchasing force on the other side of the table of a selling force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly to that point, there has been frustration on the American side of it that Europe hasn't been standing lock step with the United States when it comes to China. That China has leverage over Europe here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, China currently has leverage against most countries that consume rare earth. And I think on the front of rare earth, the Europeans and the Americans are in the same boat and they are rowing in the same direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's other items that you see --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- Well, I think, you know, it's not for me to say I'm just a central banker, but the European authorities and the U.S. administration see it slightly differently. I think it's the U.S. would see a blanket force. I think the Europeans are more interested in targeting specific industries or specific sectors where they think that it will make a difference. So it's a question of tactics that they will be discussing, I'm sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have also said recently that you think investors have begun to question whether the dollar would still warrant its status as the ultimate safe haven currency. I mean, the American dollar is one of the strongest weapons, frankly, that the administration has to use. Do you think that it is the rise of cryptocurrency that is most threatening to that or why are you worried?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see signs that the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded, and future will tell whether there is more erosion of that. But when you look at the rise of cryptos, number one, when you look at the price of gold. Gold is typically, in any situation, the ultimate destination for safe haven. Price of gold has increased by more than 50% since the beginning of the year. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So people are worried. --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- That's a clear sign that the trust in the reserve currency that the dollar has been, is and will continue to be, is eroding a bit. In addition to that, we've seen capital flows outside of the U.S. towards other destinations, including Europe. So, you know, for a currency to be really trusted you need a few things. You need geopolitical credibility. You need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need, I would call it, a military force that is strong enough. I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position, but it needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time. We've seen it with the Sterling Pound, you know, way back after, after the war. But it happens gently, gently, you don't notice it and then it happens suddenly. And we are seeing intriguing signs of it, which is why I think that having a strong institution with the Fed, for instance, is important. Having a credible environment within which to trade is important. So volatility, uncertainty, to the extent it is fueled by the administration, is not helpful to the dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly on Ukraine, President Zelenskyy said he spoke to you recently about using frozen Russian assets. What is fair use in your view?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think fair use would consist of an operational loan that would be using cash balances as collaterals. And I think that the strength of the system should be based on everyone holding Russian assets to do the same thing. So if all those countries holding assets, that have cash balances available as collaterals, go in the same direction of lending the money to Ukraine to be repaid by Russian financing of the reconstruction of Ukraine because Russia is the aggressor, then I think that that would go a long way in convincing Russia that it has to come to the table to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Christine Lagarde, always great to hear your insights. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about a lot of things. Let me just pick up where Senator Kelly left off on the shutdown. He said, hey, you could all hash this out this week, Leader Thune made that offer. I know you have said you also are concerned insurance premiums are going to go up whether Congress extends the tax credits related to Obamacare that Democrats are campaigning for, or not here, basically. Do you want this extended?",
      "SEN. BRITT: First off, Margaret, we need to reopen the government. Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing. Just as I've been traveling the state this weekend, I have heard countless stories of people who are not getting a paycheck, whether it's our men and women in uniform or those who serve alongside them, or whether we're talking to veterans or we're talking to just a number of people. When we're looking what's happening with WIC, there are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people. And so getting the government open is number one. So we need to vote on the CR and open the government back up. We've also given alternatives, like end government shutdown, and I think you'll see this week if the Democrats don't come to the table, us saying, look, Shutdown Fairness Act making sure that the people who are working are actually getting paychecks, because Margaret, these have real consequences for American people. And when we're talking about the ACA, look, Leader Thune said it best. We have always said we will have a conversation about this. We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible. They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do personally think the federal government should be off offsetting some of these costs? Because we looked at the numbers, I think it's like 130,000 Alabamans are at risk of losing insurance if the tax credit goes away.",
      "SEN. BRITT: Margaret, let's- let's be honest about this. Let's go back to Obamacare, 2010. This is the affordable air- Affordable Care Act that even the Washington Post has says was never really affordable. You go to 2014 and what you see there, though, was increases made by the Democrats, and then these increases that we're talking about right now, insurance companies have said only account for about 4% of what they're talking about increasing in 2026. The underlying issue is the brokenness of Obamacare. That is the problem. And so when you think about this, you've got the 2021 premiums that they've given to everyone. Do you understand Democrats are actually asking for us to continue premiums that are going to millionaires in some cases. We've got to be more and more responsible with taxpayer dollars. And if you want these health care systems to even be able to work, then we have to have a larger conversation. But this is absolutely, totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck. Those two things do not match up, and Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the- get the government back open and we're happy to have conversations as we have always said, just as leader- Leader Thune reiterated this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Oval Office discussing another health care matter with President Trump this past week. He credited you with announcing- well basically explaining to him that February 2024 decision by an Alabama court that ruled frozen embryos are children. He called it a 'bad decision,' and we all probably remember what it did for those families trying to go through fertilization treatment at that time. With the changes that were announced, who's going to be able to afford this now?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Look, millions more people are going to be able to afford this because of President Trump's leadership. From the very first time I talked to him about this, Margaret, he has been steadfast and unwavering, understanding that there are people from coast to coast that have been praying to be able to start their family or expand their family, and because of infertility, here in the United States, we've seen one in eight families that are actually struggling with infertility issues. We've got about 9% of men, 11% of women who are facing these challenges. President Trump believes in being, obviously, the President that is helping hard working Americans, helping parents, helping families. He's turned the Republican Party into that which is so exciting, and we want to make sure that they're going to be able to do that at a greater- at a greater scale. And so that's exactly what this will do. Millions more will have access. And additionally, we're going to drive the cost down. And so I talked this weekend, actually with a friend of mine, who came up to me and said, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this, because the affordability issue was the impediment. And she actually had to go off- over shores- overseas to try to be able to bring life into this world. It's exciting for people like her. And I've had grandparents and parents and moms and dads tell me what a game changer this is for them as they start and grow their family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one cycle of IVF can cost between $15,000 to $20,000 and lower income women obviously have a challenge with that. But during the campaign, President Trump said he was going to make the government pay for it or make insurance companies pay for it. So do you think that the Affordable Care Act, that Obamacare, for example, should cover it? Or is it too controversial for conservatives who have a moral issue with IVF?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Well, Margaret first. I mean, the Affordable Care Act is broken, and that is what we're seeing right now. I mean, you've seen the increases that people will see in 2026. 80% of those are just Obamacare, Affordable Care Act related. And so we clearly see that the underlying structure of this program is not sustainable and is not working for the American people. No one is paying less now that Obamacare is in place. And so we've got to be super honest about that. We also have to make sure that we're being responsible moving forward. What President Trump has done is made this accessible to millions more people. He's going to continue leading on this issue and so many others\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0-- It's still not free. It's still not free, right?",
      "SEN. BRITT: \u2013 that actually support hard-working families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to legislate, though to force it to be?",
      "SEN. BRITT: What we're doing to-- what want to do is I want as many people as possible to have opportunity to bring life into this world. And that's exactly what this is doing. We'll continue to work on this issue. And we also want to support families as they have children and are able to, you know- in this environment right now, we hear from people all the time, whether it is bringing life into this world, whether it is the child care cost, just the affordability aspect. And I am so proud to see President Trump lead on these. Actually, if you look at the Working Families Tax Cut, Margaret, this is the very first time we have actually increased the child care tax credits and also the DCAP tax credits in 20 years in some instances, and 40 in others. So we're trying to make sure that people can not only bring life into this world, but that it's more affordable when they get here. Because we want people to start and grow their families. That's what this is doing. This is just- the just the start. And look forward to continuing to work for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really quickly. You've been trying to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for stealing Ukrainian children. Does the President's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin endanger your efforts to get this bill passed?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Look, I am grateful for President Trump's efforts on this. If you look back, we are in this war because of President Biden. If President Biden had sent the weaponry needed to Ukraine on the front end, when we saw Russia building up. We wouldn't be in this war to start with, when you're looking at what President Trump has done, he has met with Zelensky more times in his nine months in office, then President Biden did his entire time. So, these conversations help us to have resolution--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But do you have support to help bring it to the floor?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Well, the First Lady obviously has been leading on this. We have built up support. We're having a hearing next week. I think you will see this come to the floor if there is not a resolution in the short order, because we believe in bringing these children home, Margaret. It's about 20,000 children that have been stolen from their homes. This is something everyone should be able to get behind. And Vladimir Putin should pay the price for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Katie Britt of the state of Alabama. Thank you for your time this morning, 'Face the Nation' will be back back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we begin with Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who's here in studio with us. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. MARK KELLY: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot to get to. I want to start on what you are seeing as a member of senate armed services and the intelligence committees. There are about 10,000 US forces now that are built up in the Caribbean area, either on ships or in Puerto Rico. Three B2- B-52 bombers flew near Venezuela last week. There have now been six maritime strikes by U.S. Special Operations Forces. What is this adding up to? Is the Trump administration planning regime change in Venezuela?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I hope not. Regime change hasn't ever really worked out well for us as a nation where we've supported that, whether it was in Vietnam, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan. It doesn't go the way we think, and it puts a tremendous number of Americans in harm's way. The U.S. military, the guys flying those missions now in B-52s close to the coast, those folks are at risk, members of the United States Navy now in this operation, which is clearly traditionally a law enforcement operation, now escalating to something maybe, as the president talks about regime change. I think this is the wrong move for this president. The Coast Guard has the resources to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To interdict--",
      "SEN. KELLY:\u00a0 To interject drugs. That's the way this has traditionally been done. And I do worry about the legal authorities or lack thereof that the United States military has to conduct these kind of strikes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you've been briefed on what legal authorities are being invoked. Do you think they are insufficient at this point?",
      "SEN. KELLY: They had a very hard time explaining to us the rationale, the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it. When you consider what the law of warfare, especially at sea, was, a very convoluted argument. It also included, by the way, a secret list of over 20 narco organizations, drug trafficking cartels. They wouldn't share with us the list. So the brief we got had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go round and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this. And what I worry about, Margaret, are all these young military personnel that might find out, you know, months from now, that what they did was illegal.",
      "SEN. KELLY: And then you get to what are we trying to accomplish here? We want to keep fentanyl out of the United States. And I don't know how widely known this is, but those routes through the Caribbean on boats are predominantly used to bring cocaine to Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: to Europe.",
      "SEN. KELLY: To Europe, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not to U.S. shores.",
      "SEN. KELLY: That's right. Fentanyl tends to come from a different way, and we do want to keep fentanyl out of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to this point, you just said the legality of what's being done. CBS reporting indicates that the commander who was running Southern Command, Admiral Alvin Holsey, was pressured to leave his command post early, just a year into a four-year post, and that there were tensions with Secretary Hegseth that were leading up to that departure, which Hegseth characterized as just a retirement. You speak to the top officers, can they, with confidence, refuse unlawful orders without fear of retribution or even losing their pensions?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I don't know about losing their pension, but they should. This is more important than any single person. This is about our democracy at this point, and those admirals and generals, they need to speak truth to power. I've had conversations with the most senior members of our military about this specific thing. They cannot be breaking the law. Doesn't matter if the president or the Secretary of Defense tells them to do something. If it's against the law, they have to say no. They're not required to follow an unlawful order. So we expect that from them. I don't know the exact circumstances why the admiral quit. He hasn't said publicly yet. I expect in time we're going to find out more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think he did quit? It wasn't just a retirement, suddenly?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I don't know. They could have forced him out. He could have quit. He could have said, hey, you're not accepting my advice, you need somebody else in here. I don't know. I hate to speculate about it. He had a long service in the U.S. military--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --37 years.",
      "SEN. KELLY: --highly decorated, and a tremendous leader. I appreciate his service to this country. All of us, all U.S. citizens, would be better served if this administration listened to the advice of those military leaders, especially the Secretary of Defense, who thinks he is really good at this. He should have never had this job. He was unqualified for the job, and in my view, the president should have fired him multiple times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Ukraine, you've been an outspoken supporter of it. Some of the pilots trained in your state. After President Zelenskyy met with President Trump on Friday, he said they sort of agreed to disagree on whether to get these long-range missiles, these Tomahawks that would allow them to fire into Russia. Where does that stand? President Biden wouldn't do this either.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Yeah. So I spoke to Zelenskyy three weeks ago in New York, right after his meeting with Donald Trump, and we talked about Tomahawks in that meeting. Much longer range, over 1,000 miles, 700-pound warhead. Really good--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- game changing.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Game changing. The president said he would consider giving them these- this weapon system. And then he had a conversation with Vladimir Putin. And I think it's important for people to recognize, Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. He is a master manipulator. The president has one view. Then he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he changes his story on this. Of course, Putin does not want Ukraine to get a longer-range missile that could go after targets deep into Russia, beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, by the way. It can range targets much further. It's very accurate, very survivable weapon, and Putin has a conversation with him, and those weapons are now off the table. Hey, I think Ukraine can handle it if we can give them enough rounds, and we have them in our inventory, and enough launchers. Ground launchers are rather new to this system, something we got rid of for a long period of time. They've demonstrated their ability to operate a sophisticated weapon system like the F-16. They could handle this and it would help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Zelenskyy says they're going to continue to try to persuade President Trump. I have to ask you about the shutdown. The Republican Leader John Thune has offered to sit down with Democrats to discuss Obamacare, but on the condition that Democrats end the shutdown. He posted this on social media. Can you bank this as a win and agree to start negotiations?",
      "SEN. KELLY: That's what we want. We want negotiations--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Is it enough?--",
      "SEN. KELLY: --on how to fix. I didn't look at his tweet, but what we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium. They're going to go up on November 1 for people, they can't afford it. People in my state--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --either way they are going up.",
      "SEN. KELLY: I've talked to so many people. This woman, Emily, whose husband is a pastor who has three kids, says without the Affordable Care Act, she cannot have insurance for her children. They don't get it through his work. So what we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you need to do that before November 1, when pr- premiums go up? Are you going to end the shutdown before November 1?",
      "SEN. KELLY: I would like to. I'd like to. We should be able to wrap this up this week if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us. The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress. That's it, one hour. They need to get in a room and stay in a room until we can hash this out. The president has said he wants to fix this premium thing and he wants the government open. That's what we want.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's progress this week. Senator, thank you for your time.",

    "summary": "President Trump called Colombia's president an \"illegal drug leader\" and pledged to end U.S. aid to the country, following the leader's criticism of U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump called Colombia's president an \"illegal drug leader\" on Sunday and pledged to end U.S. aid to the South American country, following the leader's criticism of U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro in a post on Truth Social of \"encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields.\"",
      "\"It has become the biggest business in [Colombia], by far, and Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,\" the president said, continuing in all caps: \"AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA.\"",
      "Hours earlier, Petro accused the U.S. in a series of X posts of hitting a fishing vessel in a strike it carried out last month, not a boat carrying drugs as it had claimed at the time. The Colombian leader said a fisherman had been killed in the attack, saying that in doing so the U.S. had \"invaded national territory.\" He made a similar allegation earlier this month, claiming another boat that was struck by the U.S. military carried Colombian citizens \u2014 which the U.S. denied.",
      "Petro's intervention has added to mounting scrutiny of the administration's strikes, which it has characterized as being part of a broader effort to combat drug smuggling and stem the flow of narcotics into the U.S.",
      "It comes after a U.S. strike Thursday on a vessel in the Caribbean Sea, the sixth known attack in the area since last month, and the first in which survivors were reported. Mr. Trump said Saturday that the two survivors, one from Ecuador and the other from Colombia, would be returned to their countries of origin.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said in his post Sunday that the U.S. will no longer offer payments and subsidies to Colombia, claiming that the country's drug production is intended for \"the sale of massive amounts of product into the United States, causing death, destruction, and havoc.\"",
      "\"Petro, a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely,\" the president said.",
      "Petro pushed back on Mr. Trump's allegations in a post on X, arguing that he has been the primary foe of drug trafficking in his country in recent years. Petro later said Mr. Trump had been \"rude and ignorant\" toward Colombia.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration added Colombia to its list of countries it deems as failing to uphold its responsibilities to control drug trafficking for the first time in almost three decades. The department said that under Petro's leadership, \"coca cultivation and cocaine production have reached record highs while Colombia's government failed to meet even its own vastly reduced coca eradication goals.\"",
      "At the same time, the administration issued a waiver allowing Colombia, a traditional U.S. ally in anti-drug trafficking efforts, to continue to receive aid.",
      "It is not clear what U.S. payments to Colombia will now be cut off.",
      "Petro, the first leftist elected president of Colombia in decades, has repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration in recent weeks. In addition to his criticism on social media, he denounced the strikes on alleged drug boats in a speech before the United Nations last month and later, during a New York protest event, encouraged members of the U.S. military to \"disobey\" Mr. Trump's orders. The move prompted the State Department to announce it would revoke Petro's visa.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats have also drawn backlash from neighboring Venezuela, which has accused the Trump administration of aggression. The administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with drug cartels, which he has denied."

      "\"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the State Department added. It did not disclose what those measures might entail.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas rejected the claims by the U.S. State Department, calling them \"false allegations.\" The group accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "This also comes\u00a0after CBS News obtained a video\u00a0on Wednesday, which shows armed Hamas fighters standing over Palestinians they have accused of being gang members collaborating with Israel. Moments later in the video, they execute them.",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News that the video depicts a long pattern of punishment that Hamas uses against suspected collaborators with Israel.",

      "\"Israel has empowered, with weapons and money, gangs of Palestinians who were involved in mostly illegal activities in the past \u2014 selling drugs, illegal smuggling \u2014 and they've empowered them as an alternative to Hamas,\" Baskin said. \"This is not sustainable.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump acknowledged reports that Hamas was engaged in violence against rival Palestinian groups but appeared to downplay them as a concern.",
      "\"They did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad gangs, very, very bad,\" Mr. Trump said of Hamas while speaking with reporters Tuesday. \"And that didn't bother me much, to be honest with you.\"",
      "Hamas' role in Gaza's future remains murky. Israel has demanded that Hamas disarm. The U.S.-brokered peace plan calls for it to relinquish its governance of the Palestinian territory to a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" But Hamas has been quick to reassert itself, making clear that it has retain some power and organization despite Israel's efforts to destroy it.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump and world leaders signed onto\u00a0the U.S.-brokered agreement\u00a0designed to bring a halt to the two-year Israel-Hamas war.",
      "As part of the deal, Hamas released 20 living hostages, while Israel released about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israel also pulled its troops back to a preapproved line in Gaza.",
      "The deal also calls for Hamas to release the remains of 28 deceased hostages, but so far it has only released the remains of 10 of those.\u00a0Another two bodies\u00a0were released by Hamas Saturday, but they are pending identification.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:24:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Since the Gaza peace plan took effect early this week, Hamas has handed over 20 living hostages and the confirmed remains of 12 hostages.",
    "story": [
      "Israel identified the remains of two hostages on Sunday after Hamas handed over their bodies to the Red Cross the night before.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the bodies belonged to Ronen Engel, a father of three from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai agricultural worker killed at Kibbutz Be'eri. Both were believed to have been killed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack and their bodies were taken to Gaza. Engel's wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in an earlier ceasefire in November 2023.",
      "Since the Gaza peace plan took effect early this week, Hamas has handed over 20 living hostages and the confirmed remains of at least 12 hostages. The remains of at least 16 Hamas-held hostages are still unaccounted for. One of the bodies released to Israel did not belong to a hostage.",
      "The handover of remains, along with aid deliveries into Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory, are among key points in the ceasefire, reached on Oct. 10, meant to end two years of war.",
      "President Trump joined world leaders in Egypt on Monday to sign the U.S.-brokered peace plan\u00a0that saw Hamas agree to release all remaining living and deceased hostages in exchange for Israel releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who had been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Hamas handed over the bodies of four confirmed hostages on Monday, another three on Tuesday, and two on Wednesday. That same day, it said that it had released all the\u00a0Israeli hostage remains\u00a0in Gaza that it had been able to recover. But on Friday, it returned another confirmed hostage.",
      "And according to the Associated Press, as part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has so far returned to Gaza the bodies of at least 135 Palestinians. On Sunday, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza said Israel returned the bodies of another 15 Palestinians.",
      "A senior U.S. adviser told reporters on a call Wednesday that \"nobody is getting left behind,\" noting they believe there are still many bodies buried under the mountains of rubble across Gaza. Senior U.S. advisers said the level of destruction also makes it difficult to move around in the Palestinian territory.",
      "Mr. Trump also said in Egypt on Monday that not all of the bodies of the deceased hostages had been found, adding that unidentified parties were still \"working out\" how to locate an unspecified number of remains.",
      "Mike Waltz, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday that U.S. personnel would take part in the effort to recover the remains of hostages.",
      "Tensions emerged over the implementation of the peace plan this weekend, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violating the ceasefire in recent days.",
      "The Israeli military said on Sunday that militants shot at troops in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in the Israeli-controlled areas, according to the agreed-upon ceasefire lines. No injuries were reported. A senior Hamas official denied to the Associated Press that Hamas was involved.",
      "Netanyahu's office announced Saturday that the critical southern Gaza border crossing of Rafah, which connects with Egypt, \"would not be opened until further notice,\" saying that its opening would be dependent \"on how Hamas fulfills its part in returning the abductees and implementing the agreed-upon outline.\"",
      "Hamas responded by calling the move \"a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department issued a statement late Saturday saying that the U.S. had learned of a plan by Hamas to attack \"Palestinian civilians.\"",
      "The U.S. said it \"had informed the guarantor nations of the Gaza peace agreement of credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.\"",
      "Hamas rejected the U.S. claims on Sunday, calling them \"false allegations\" and accusing Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "This comes after\u00a0CBS News obtained a video on Wednesday that showed armed Hamas fighters standing over Palestinians they accused of being gang members collaborating with Israel. Moments later, they execute them.",
      "The disturbing images are part of a long pattern of punishment meted out to suspected collaborators, Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News."

    "story": [
      "Crowds hit the streets Saturday in cities and towns across the country to vent their anger over President Trump's policies in \"No Kings\" protests, which Republicans have slammed as \"Hate America\" rallies.",
      "People carrying signs with slogans such as \"Nothing is more patriotic than protesting\" or \"Resist Fascism\" packed into New York City's Times Square and rallied by the thousands in parks in Boston, Atlanta and Chicago. Demonstrators marched through Washington and downtown Los Angeles and picketed outside capitols in several Republican-led states, a courthouse in Billings, Montana, and at hundreds of smaller public spaces.",
      "Mr. Trump's Republican Party disparaged the demonstrations as \"Hate America\" rallies, but in many places the events looked more like a street party. There were marching bands, huge banners with the U.S. Constitution's \"We The People\" preamble that people could sign, and demonstrators wearing inflatable costumes, particularly frogs, which have emerged as a sign of resistance in Portland, Oregon.",
      "More than 2,700 demonstrations were planned coast to coast, with at least one in every state and even near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, where he is spending the weekend.",
      "Organizers said the nationwide rally drew more people than similar events on June 14, which was Mr. Trump's birthday and the day of a giant\u00a0military parade in the U.S. capital, the No Kings Coalition said in a news release.",
      "\"The millions of people protesting are centered around a fierce love for our country. A country that we believe is worth fighting for,\" said Katie Bethell, the executive director of MoveOn, an advocacy group that's part of the larger coalition.",
      "Protestors said they were outraged over the Trump administration's crackdown on undocumented migrants and its deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles.",
      "Since then, Mr. Trump \u2014 who returned to the White House in January \u2014 has ordered National Guard troops into Washington, D.C. and Memphis. Planned deployments to Chicago and Portland\u00a0have so far been blocked in the courts.",
      "Demonstrators are also upset over Mr. Trump's attacks on the media, prosecutions of his political opponents and a host of other actions they see as authoritarian.",
      "On its website, \"No Kings\" organizers say, \"The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don't have kings and we won't back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty.\"",
      "\"This president is a disgrace and I hope there will be millions in the street today,\" Stephanie, a 36-year-old hospital worker who did not give her last name, told AFP in the Queens borough of New York, where hundreds had already gathered in the morning.",
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered in Portland for a peaceful demonstration downtown. Later in the day, tensions grew as a few hundred protesters and counterprotesters showed up at a U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement building, with federal agents at times firing tear gas to disperse the crowd and city police threatening to make arrests if demonstrators blocked streets.",
      "The building has been the site of mostly small nightly protests since June \u2014 the reason the Trump administration has cited for trying to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, which a federal judge has at least temporarily blocked.",
      "More than 10,000 people showed up at Lafitte Greenway for the No King New Orleans rally, organizers told CBS News. When asked about how numbers were counted, they said it was based on RSVPs online and other on-the-ground crowd-counting measures.",

      "\"May that powerful voice be heard from here to Washington, D.C., and every corner of this country,\" Ramirez said, CBS Chicago reported. \"I am the proud daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, and I will never be ashamed of my roots.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker joined the demonstration.",
      "In San Francisco hundreds of people spelled out \"No King!\" and other phrases with their bodies on Ocean Beach. Hayley Wingard, who was dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she too had never been to a protest before. Only recently she began to view Trump as a \"dictator.\"",
      "\"I was actually OK with everything until I found that the military invasion in Los Angeles and Chicago and Portland \u2014 Portland bothered me the most, because I'm from Portland, and I don't want the military in my cities. That's scary,\" Wingard said.",
      "In Miami, one demonstrator told CBS Miami\u00a0that she showed up to give voice to those who feel the most marginalized in the country.",
      "\"I'm most worried about people who aren't doing well in this country, people who are being marginalized,\" said Roxanne Featherly. \"The hate [and] I guess you can say the bipolarism that we have.\"",
      "More than 1,500 people gathered in Birmingham, Alabama, evoking and openly citing the city's history of protests and the critical role it played in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement two generations ago, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"It just feels like we're living in an America that I don't recognize,\" Jessica Yother, a mother of four, told the AP. \"It was so encouraging. I walked in and thought, 'Here are my people.'\"",
      "Outside of the U.S., crowds gathered outside U.S. embassies in Berlin, Rome, Paris and Sweden in solidarity with the protesters in the U.S. Photos show them holding signs denouncing fascism and dictatorships.",
      "So far, the president's response to the events has been muted.",
      "\"They're saying they're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,\" he told Fox News show \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" in an interview that will air on Sunday.",
      "But top surrogates, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, dismissed the event. Johnson called it the \"Hate America Rally.\"",
      "\"You're going to bring together the Marxists, the Socialists, the Antifa advocates, the anarchists and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat Party,\" he told reporters.",
      "Republican lawmaker Tom Emmer also used the \"Hate America\" phrase and referred to participants as the \"terrorist wing\" of the Democratic Party. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin activated the National Guard and announced a \"substantially increased police presence\" ahead of the planned events. He said that protestors have the right to free speech but that \"does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic, or violence of any kind\u2014for which there will be zero tolerance.\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also said the National Guard and public safety employees will be surged to Austin to handle expected protests.",
      "Top Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer encouraged demonstrators to let their voices be heard.",
      "\"I say to my fellow Americans this No Kings Day: Do not let Donald Trump and Republicans intimidate you into silence. That's what they want to do. They're afraid of the truth,\" he wrote on X. \"Speak out, use your voice, and exercise your right to free speech.\""

      "Thursday's strike marks the\u00a0sixth known boat attack\u00a0in the area since last month \u2014 and the first known attack with survivors. Mr. Trump said the strike was against a submarine carrying mostly fentanyl and other illegal narcotics.",
      "\"Under my watch, the United States of America will not tolerate narcoterrorists trafficking illegal drugs, by land or by sea,\" he said in the post.",
      "A Navy helicopter transported the survivors from the semi-submersible to a Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News on Friday.",
      "\"It is the custom of the sea to save people who are at risk in international waters. You don't sort of sail on. That's against every principle of naval activity,\" Eugene R. Fidell, a senior research scholar at Yale Law School, told CBS News on Friday. \"You're supposed to save people, even though the people here are people who are only in danger because the U.S. was attempting to kill them.\"",
      "After the president's announcement regarding U.S. plans to repatriate the survivors, the Pentagon posted a short video of the strike on social media. The Department of Defense Rapid Response provided no other details about the attack.",
      "At least 27 people have been killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the administration.",
      "In some cases, Mr. Trump has posted videos of the strikes to Truth Social and alleged the boats were carrying drugs, describing the deceased as \"narcotraffickers.\" The administration has justified the strikes by arguing the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels.",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" the president told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Some lawmakers have pushed back on the strikes, arguing the administration needs to get permission from Congress to attack drug cartels and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats are carrying narcotics.",
      "The attacks are taking place amid a wider military buildup in the Caribbean, as the administration pressures the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of working with drug cartels.",
      "The U.S. has deployed eight warships, fighter jets and 10,000 U.S. forces to the region. And on Wednesday, American B-52 bombers flew about 150 miles north of the coast of Venezuela, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Mr. Trump also confirmed Wednesday that he had authorized covert CIA action in Venezuela, citing drugs and migration.",
      "\"I think Venezuela is feeling heat,\" the president said during an Oval Office event.",
      "And in comments from the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump confirmed a recent New York Times report that Venezuelan officials had offered the U.S. a huge stake in the country's oil, gold and other natural resources to try to end U.S. actions taken against the country. He said Friday of Maduro, \"He has offered everything. He's offered everything,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're right. You know why? Because he doesn't want to f*** around with the United States.\"",
      "Maduro has denied connections to drug trafficking and accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change. Earlier this week, he said he's ready to declare a state of emergency over American \"aggression,\" and granted himself additional powers in case the U.S. \"dares to attack our homeland.\""

      "\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects. The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore,\" Russ Vought, director of the budget office, wrote on X.",
      "He said additional information would come from the Army Corps of Engineers. It's unclear whether the \"lower-priority projects\" being paused include others beyond those in New York, San Francisco, Baltimore and Boston, which are all located in states represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has been targeting federal dollars going to projects in Democratic-led cities and states since the early days of the shutdown, which entered its 17th day on Friday and is set to continue into next week. The Trump administration has so far\u00a0frozen roughly $18 billion for a pair of infrastructure projects in New York City,\u00a0canceled $8 billion for climate-related efforts in 16 states and withheld $2.1 billion for infrastructure projects in Chicago. All of the states that would benefit from the funds are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",

    "story": [
      "Powerful members of the Democratic National Committee will soon decide how states will be chosen to be among the first to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries, moving the party closer to one of the most important decisions it will make in the coming years.",
      "CBS News has learned that at a meeting later this month, the party's influential rules and bylaws panel will focus on the application process to be among the first handful of states to hold a Democratic presidential nominating contest.",
      "Earning one of these prized slots is likely to bring about outsized power in the political process. With that influence comes major attention from candidates, a potential economic boost and the chance to play a role in how Democrats message and campaign on major topics and issues as the party tries to find a path forward after stinging losses in last year's presidential election.",
      "A source familiar with the calendar efforts detailed the materials written by the co-chairs of the party's rules and bylaws panel, including a draft resolution and request for proposal, were shared Friday with members. At the late October meeting, members will have a chance to revise and vote on the work.",
      "The resolution outlines standards, which according to the source, cover the following:",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;\u00a0Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;\u00a0Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;",
      "Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;",
      "Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "The plans call for four or five states to be chosen by DNC members to hold a nominating contest in what's known as the \"early window,\" which comes before states begin voting in large numbers on Super Tuesday and the weeks afterwards. Under the draft, each of the four regions being focused on by the DNC, the East, Midwest, South and West, would need to have at least one state from its respective areas be chosen.",
      "The work comes after Democrats overhauled the early voting calendar during Joe Biden's time as president, jettisoning the Iowa caucuses from being the first state to have its say on a presidential nominee. Party leaders followed Biden's push to instead install South Carolina, whose primary revived his 2020 presidential primary campaign, in the top voting spot instead.",
      "New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden had struggled to a fifthplace primary finish in 2020, was given the chance to remain an early voting state but was moved down to sharing its primary day with Nevada. The general election presidential battleground states of Georgia and Michigan were selected to round out the list.",
      "The perceived pushback against New Hampshire was derided by Democrats from the state, who have a tradition of intensely defending its first-in-the-nation primary status and have a state law to help it try and do so.",
      "In early 2024, the state held a primary outside of the DNC process before South Carolina voted, resulting in Mr. Biden's not filing in New Hampshire's contest. Allies, however, rallied behind a robust write-in campaign for him in New Hampshire. Mr. Biden easily won without his name even being on the ballot, which calmed tensions between first-in-the-nation advocates and Biden supporters.",
      "Any state can apply for the early window slots. While South Carolina was the first DNC approved primary last year, it's not certain it will be picked to start the calendar again. While the southern state is reliably red in general elections, Mr. Biden's view, as shared in a 2022 letter, invoked South Carolina's diversity when he urged DNC members to \"ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window.\"",
      "New Hampshire is expected to try to regain its place as the first 2028 DNC primary state with a pitch that can be made about the state's tradition, small size, voter engagement and ability for unexpected candidates to succeed. Democrats in Nevada however are also already making a case that the presidential battleground state out West should go first instead.",
      "In an August memo, Nevada State Democratic Party Executive Director Hilary Barrett argued that \"elevating a union-strong, diverse, highly competitive battleground state will lay the groundwork to help Democrats win back working-class voters and voters of color. If we fail to rebuild that coalition, we won't win back the White House.\"",
      "There's potential that Michigan, a state crucial to Democrats' chances of winning the presidency, could rise to the top slot, given the party's hope that early primary attention and investments may help a Democratic presidential candidate carry the state's electoral votes in 2028."

      "Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson tackles everything from moon explosions to Superman's time-traveling tricks in his new book, \"Just Visiting This Planet, Revised and Updated for the Twenty-First Century: Further Scientific Adventures of Merlin from Omniscia,\" introducing readers to Merlin, an alien character he created early in his career.",
      "\"Back then, you could have a simple question, but you couldn't get an easy answer,\" Tyson said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday. \"Now, you can type anything into Google, into ChatGPT. If you have ever seen those replies that come in from AI, it's got no soul. It's got no personality.\"",
      "He says the questions he gets today are more playful and imaginative.",
      "\"People are now asking questions that are a little more fun, rather than, 'How hot is the sun?' Stuff you can just look up.\"",
      "One example he highlights: \"If aliens came and exploded the moon, what effect would that have on us?\"",
      "Tyson notes that while the moon might not be crucial now, it may have helped early life by creating isolated tide pools. \"Without the moon, astronomers would be very happy, because the sky would be dark all the time,\" he said.",
      "Likelihood of life elsewhere",
      "On the topic of aliens, Tyson is clear about the science and the skepticism.",

      "\"So someone said, 'How accurate is the leap year correction?' Because one day every four years, you have a leap day. Turns out, that over corrects. So every 100 years, you have to take away a leap day that would otherwise be there. And that under corrects. Now you have to add a leap day back every 400 years to correct for the other two leap days.\"",

    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

The group published a study on the new finding in the October issue of its scientific journal, the\u00a0Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",
      "While ORCs detected in the past looked like one bright circle, this one consisted of two intersecting rings, which is rare. Previously, research into ORCs suggested the rings could be caused by shockwaves that were triggered by the merging of supermassive black holes or galaxies, but the latest findings propose that they actually could be linked to \"superwind\" flowing out of their host galaxies, the Royal Astronomical Society said.",

      "The magnetic field surrounding Earth protects the planet from cosmic radiation and particles charged by the sun. Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.",
      "The weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.",
      "The ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.",
      "The satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",
      "The satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.",
      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",

      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",

    "summary": "The family is among dozens suing Roblox, Discord and other tech platforms, alleging they allowed sexual predators access to their children.",
    "story": [
      "The popular online gaming platform Roblox, which hosts millions of user-created games, is being sued by families and state attorneys general who claim online predators can groom, extort and exploit kids they meet on the platform.",
      "Steven, a father of two, is among those who have filed lawsuits as his family tries to rebuild their life after his son was allegedly targeted.",
      "He said that allowing his teen son to play Roblox seemed like a safe bet \u2014 at first.",
      "\"I set up every parental control I could find and did the best I could,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview, asking that CBS News only use his first name for privacy reasons.",
      "But despite the platform's parental controls, an alleged sex offender posing as a 16-year-old befriended his 13-year-old son in the popular \"Pet Simulator\" game, according to the lawsuit. Steven alleged the predator offered his son Roblox gift cards in exchange for sexually explicit photos, which his son sent via Discord \u2013 a separate gaming and chat platform.",
      "\"At a certain point it was, 'tell me what your address is' and when he said no, he's like, 'Well, I have these photos of you, I'll tell your parents,'\" Steven said of the interaction between the predator and his son back in July 2024. \"He was 30 feet down the hall from us and just\u2014 felt too trapped to \u2026 come and talk to us.\"",
      "It was \"pure luck,\" Steven said, that he found out \u2014 because of a threatening message from the perpetrator that allegedly popped up as he was replacing the screen on his son's phone, which had cracked.",
      "The person has since pleaded guilty to first-degree felony child endangerment.",
      "Lawsuits against Roblox, Discord",
      "Steven's family is among dozens of families, as well as attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, who are suing Roblox and other tech platforms, alleging they allowed sexual predators access to their children.",
      "Kentucky announced a lawsuit against Roblox last month, and Louisiana filed a suit against the platform in August.",
      "\"For years, Roblox has ignored this crisis so it could continue turning a profit,\" Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement. \"Our responsibility is to protect Kentucky children from online exploitation by these predators and the companies like Roblox that knowingly facilitate it.\"",
      "Steven said his family is suing Roblox as well as Discord, an instant messaging and social platform, because \"at the end of the day, the thing they seem to care about the most is the bottom line, their profit.\"",
      "\"It almost feels like they're a haven for \u2026 predators, pedophiles, dangerous individuals and like they should do better,\" he said.",
      "Steven's attorney Alexandra Walsh, with the firm Anapol Weiss, is currently investigating hundreds of cases of child endangerment and grooming that allegedly started on Roblox.",
      "\"Roblox was the gateway. Roblox is the site that ... in this case that gave this predator, this very dangerous man, the ability to find a target and groom this child,\" Walsh said.",
      "Steven has moved his family across the country to have a new start as he supports his son through depression and PTSD, he said.",
      "\"This thing happens so much faster than you can ever imagine,\" Steven said. \"You want to believe that like \u2026 you've done everything you can and that it'll never happen to me and I thought the same thing until it did.\"",
      "Roblox and Discord respond",
      "Matt Kaufman, the chief safety officer at Roblox, said the platform does not allow image sharing in filtered chats and has rolled out over 100 new safety features this year, including age estimation and increased chat monitoring.",
      "\"We have safety systems that are in place by default and a lot of these situations that you're talking about, like extortion, people sharing, graphic images, they simply cannot happen on Roblox,\" Kaufman said.",
      "Until recently, Roblox did not verify players' ages. By the end of the year, all users will have to pass its checks to communicate within the platform. According to Roblox, these checks will include \"a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification and verified parental consent.\"",
      "Currently, any communication between adult users and those between 13 and 17 is prohibited, unless a real life confirmed relationship can be proven.",
      "\"For users 13 to 17 who confirm their age through Facial Age Estimation, adding a Trusted Connection, whether a peer or an 18 or older user, requires an existing real-world relationship, verified by a QR scan or Contact Importer,\" Roblox says on its site.",
      "Roblox's chief safety officer  Kaufman said the company has caught and self-reported 23,000 incidents of\u00a0potentially harmful content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children so far this year.",
      "\"What's really important about these cases that we report is: we report when we see signs of something that doesn't look safe,\" Kaufman said. \"Any platform of our size \u2026 it draws bad actors and our job is to do the best that we possibly can to prevent anything from happening on our platform and to report those situations as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Discord told CBS News it won't comment on pending litigation, but said in a statement that it is \"deeply committed to safety,\" and works to \"prevent the spread of sexual exploitation and grooming.\""

      "Al-Muhtadi was charged with providing, attempting to provide or conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and the fraud and misuse of a visa or other documents. The charges were brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel after hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.",
      "Al-Muhtadi's phone pinged a cell tower near Kibbutz Kfar Aza at about 10:01 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, the documents said, a few hours after the attack began. Kibbutz Kfar Aza is just a few miles from Gaza's border. Sixty people were killed there, and 19 were kidnapped, the court documents said. More than 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage during the attack. The documents do not accuse al-Muhtadi of any killings or specific crimes.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel within hours of hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly submitted a U.S. visa application in June 2024, the court documents said. In the application, he said that he was not a member or representative of a terror organization, that he had no specialized skills or training, including firearm usage, and had never engaged in terrorist activities.",
      "He met with a U.S. Embassy consular official in August and entered the United States through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Sept. 12, 2024, according to the documents. He lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for several months, the documents said. Photos shared by al-Muhtadi on social media show him posing with a gun in his Tulsa apartment.",
      "In early 2025, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents located al-Muhtadi living in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he worked in a local restaurant.",
      "A person with al-Muhtadi's name and birth date was being held at the St. Martin Parish Correctional Center near Lafayette, according to online records. He was booked into the facility on Thursday. He made his initial court appearance on Friday, according to court records. Online records did not make it clear if he had a lawyer.",
      "Federal prosecutors have previously charged six senior Hamas leaders with the deaths of at least 43 American citizens on Oct. 7. Those charged included former Hamas leader\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in October 2024."

      "There are about 10,000 U.S. forces now that are built up in the Caribbean area either on ships or in Puerto Rico. Three B-2 \u2013 B-52 bombers flew near Venezuela last week. There have now been six maritime strikes by U.S. Special Operations forces.",
      "What is this adding up to? Is the Trump administration planning regime change in Venezuela?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I hope not. Regime change hasn't ever really worked out well for us as a nation where we have supported that, whether it was in Vietnam, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan. It doesn't go the way we think, and it puts a tremendous number of Americans in harm's way, the U.S. military, the guys flying those missions now in B-52s close to the coast.",
      "Those folks are at risk, members of the United States Navy now in this operation, which is clearly, traditionally a law enforcement operation, now escalating to something maybe, as the president talks about, regime change. I think this is the wrong move for this president. The Coast Guard has the resources to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To interdict drug traffickers.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: To interdict drugs. That's the way this has traditionally been done, and I do worry about the legal authorities or lack thereof that the United States military has to conduct these kind of strikes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have been briefed on what legal authorities are being invoked. Do you think they are insufficient at this point?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: They \u2013 they had a very hard time explaining to us the rationale, the legal rationale, for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it, when you consider what \u2013 the law of warfare, especially at sea.",
      "It was a very convoluted argument. It also included, by the way, a secret list of over 20 narco organizations, drug trafficking cartels. But they wouldn't share with us the list. So the brief we got was \u2013 had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go around and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.",
      "And what I worry about, Margaret, are all these young military personnel that might find out months from now that what they did was illegal. And then you get to, what are we trying to accomplish here? We want to keep fentanyl out of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I don't know how widely known this is, but those routes through the Caribbean on boats are predominantly used to bring cocaine to Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To Europe, not to U.S. shores.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to this point you just said, the legality of what's being done, CBS reporting indicates that the commander who was running Southern Command, Admiral Alvin Holsey, was pressured to leave his command post early just a year into a four-year post and that there were tensions with Secretary Hegseth that were leading up to that departure, which Hegseth characterized as just a retirement.",

      "This is more important than any single person. This is about our democracy at this point. And those admirals and generals, they need to speak truth to power. I have had conversations with the most senior members of our military about this specific thing. They cannot be breaking the law.",
      "Doesn't matter if the president or the secretary of defense tells them to do something. If it's against the law, they have to say no. They're not required to follow an unlawful order. So we expect that from them. I don't know the exact circumstances, why the admiral quit. He hasn't said publicly yet. I expect, in time, we're going to find out more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think he did quit? It wasn't just a retirement suddenly?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: This weapon system, and then he had a conversation with Vladimir Putin.",
      "And I think it's important for people to recognize Vladimir Putin is a former KGB officer. He is a master manipulator. The president has one view. Then he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he changes his story on this. Of course Putin does not want Ukraine to get\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 a longer-range missile that could go after targets deep into Russia, beyond Moscow and St. Petersburg, by the way. It can range targets much further. It's very accurate. It's a very survivable weapon.",
      "And Putin has a conversation with him and those weapons are now off the table. Hey, I think Ukraine can handle \u2013 if we can give them enough rounds, if we have them in our inventory and enough launchers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Ground launchers are rather new to the system, something we got rid of for a long period of time.",
      "They have demonstrated their ability to operate a sophisticated weapon system like the F-16. They could handle this, and it would help.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Zelenskyy says they're going to continue to try to persuade President Trump.",
      "I have to ask you about the shutdown. The Republican leader, John Thune, has offered to sit down with Democrats to discuss Obamacare, but on the condition that Democrats end the shutdown. He posted this on social media.",
      "Can you bank this as a win and agree to start negotiations?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: That's what we want. We want negotiations on how to fix\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this enough?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: \u2026 how to \u2013 I didn't look at his tweet, but what we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium.",
      "They're going to go up on November 1 for people. They can't afford it. People in my state\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Either way, they're going up .",

      "This woman Emily (sp?), whose husband's a pastor, who has three kids, says, without the Affordable Care Act, she cannot have insurance for her children. They don't get it through his work. So what we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you need to do that before November 1, when premiums go up?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to end the shutdown before November 1?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I would like to. I would like to \u2013 we should \u2013 we could \u2013 we should be able to wrap this up this week if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us.",
      "The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: That's it, one hour. They need to get in the room and stay in the room until we can hash this out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: The president has said he wants to fix this premium thing and he wants the government open. That's what we want.",

      "Welcome to Face the Nation, Senator.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT (R-Alabama): Thank you so much for having me, Margaret. I appreciate it. Look forward to being on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about a lot of things, but let me just pick up where Senator Kelly left off on the shutdown.",
      "He said, hey, you could all hash this out this week. Leader Thune made that offer. I know you have said you also are concerned insurance premiums are going to go up, whether Congress extends the tax credits related to Obamacare that Democrats are campaigning for or not here, basically.",
      "Do you want this extended?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: First off, Margaret, we need to reopen the government. Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing.",
      "Just as I have been traveling the state this weekend, I have heard countless stories of people who are not getting a paycheck, whether it's our men and women in uniform or those who serve alongside them, or whether we're talking to veterans or we're talking to just a number of people, when we're looking what's happening with WIC.",
      "There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people. And so getting the government open is number one. So we need to vote on this C.R. and open the government back up.",
      "We have also given alternatives like end government shutdown. And I think you will see this week, if the Democrats don't come to the table, saying, look, a Shutdown Fairness Act, making sure that the people who are working are actually getting paychecks, because, Margaret, these have real consequences for American people.",
      "And when we're talking about the ACA, look, Leader Thune said it best. We have always said we will have a conversation about this. We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible.",
      "They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do personally think the federal government should be offsetting some of these costs? Because we looked at the numbers, and I think it's like 130,000 Alabamans are at risk of losing insurance if the tax credit goes away.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Margaret, let's be honest about this. Let's go back to Obamacare, 2010.",
      "This is the Affordable Air \u2013 Affordable Care Act that even \"The Washington Post\" has said was never really affordable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: You go to 2014, and what you see there though was increases made by the Democrats.",
      "And then these increases that we're talking about right now, insurance companies have said only account for about 4 percent of what they're talking about increasing in 2026. The underlying issue is the brokenness of Obamacare. That is the problem.",
      "And so, when you think about this, you have got the 2021 premiums that they have given to everyone. Do you understand Democrats are actually asking for us to continue premiums that are going to millionaires in some cases? We have got to be more \u2013 more responsible with taxpayer dollars.",
      "And if you want these health care systems to even be able to work, then we have to have a larger conversation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: But this is absolutely, totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.",
      "Those two things do not match up. And Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the government back open. And we're happy to have conversations, as we have always said, just as Leader Thune reiterated this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Oval Office discussing another health care matter with President Trump this past week.",
      "He credited you with announcing \u2013 well, basically explaining to him that February 2024 decision by an Alabama court that ruled frozen embryos are children. He called it a bad decision, and we all probably remember what it did for those families trying to go through fertilization treatment at that time.",
      "With the changes that were announced, who's going to be able to afford this now?",
      "SENATOR KATIE BRITT: Look, millions more people are going to be able to afford this because of President Trump's leadership.",
      "From the very first time I talked to him about this, Margaret, he has been steadfast and unwavering, understanding that there are people from coast to coast that have been praying to be able to start their family or expand their family.",

      "You've said that many economists overestimated the impact of Trump's tariffs. Does that mean you think we've moved past the point of risk, or are we yet to feel the pain?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE (President, European Central Bank): I think we're yet to feel the pain. What we observe \u2013 I'll give you some numbers. From Europe to the United States, our goods to the U.S. consumers had a tariff of 1.5. With the tariff that was decided by the U.S. administration, it's gone up to 13 percent. So, the question is, where does this additional 11-ish percentage point go? At the moment, it's one-third on the exporter, so the European company, one-third of the U.S. importer, and one-third of the consumer.",
      "What will happen, though, is that these two-thirds born by two corporates essentially, the exporter and the importer, is based on the squeeze of the margins. How long are they going to put up with the squeeze of the margin? To be seen. And when they don't, because it's becoming too tight, then it will be on the consumer. So, it's a question of time.",

      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are talks happening we understand between the world's two largest economies. The Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on social media he's going to meet with China's vice premiere in the coming days. This was after he called the negotiator unhinged recently, and President Trump said that starting November 1st there will be new tariffs as retaliation for Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. These are the largest economies in the world. Where does this go? How damaging does this get?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I would discount a little bit of the positioning at the moment because this is typical of negotiating tactics on both sides. Typical. You show your muscles and you say that you are ready to kill. I'm exaggerating, of course.",

      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: But people will have to come to the table because it's the interest of both economies, despite the hostility that there is between the two.",
      "But China is using an advantage that it has built over the course of time by accumulating rare earth and the ways to refine rare earth and then to sell it to the rest of the world. They have very, very strong trading position on that front, and they're going to use it, which is why I think that on the other side, the consumers, that is the United States, Europe and a few other countries around the world, we should, you know, join forces and be a purchasing force on the other side of the table of a selling force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly to that point, there has been frustration on the American side of it that Europe hasn't been standing lockstep with the United States when it comes to China. That China has leverage over Europe here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, China currently has leverage against most countries that consume rare earth. And I think on the front of rare earth, the Europeans and the Americans are in the same boat, and they are rowing in the same direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's other items that you see space (ph) on?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, I think, you know, it's not for me to say. I'm just a central banker. But the \u2013 the European authorities and the U.S. administration see it slightly differently. I think it's the \u2013 the U.S. would see a blanket force. I think the Europeans are more interested in targeting specific industries or specific sectors where they think that it will make a difference. So, it's a question of tactics that they will be discussing, I'm sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you have also said recently that you think investors have begun to question what the dollar would still warrant its status at the ultimate safe haven currency. I mean the American dollar is one of the strongest weapons, frankly, that \u2013 that the administration has to use.",
      "Do you think that it is the rise of cryptocurrency that is most threatening to that, or why are you worried?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see signs that the \u2013 the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded. And future will tell whether there is more erosion of that. But when you look at the rise of crypto is number one. When you look at the price of gold. Gold is typically in any situation the ultimate destination for safe haven. Price of gold has increased by more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people are worried (ph) \u2013",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: That's a clear sign that the trust in the reserve currency that the dollar has been is and will continue to be is eroding a bit.",
      "Now, in addition to that, we've seen capital flows outside of the U.S. towards other destinations, including Europe. So, you know, for a currency to be really trusted, you need a few things. You need geopolitical credibility. You need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need, I would call it a military force that is strong enough. I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position. But it needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time. We've seen it with the sterling pound, you know, way back after the \u2013 after the war. But it happens gently, gently, you don't notice it, and then it happens suddenly. And we are seeing intriguing signs of it, which is why I think that having a strong institution with the Fed, for instance, is important. Having a credible environment within which to trade is important. So, volatility, uncertainty to the extent it is fueled by the administration is not helpful to the dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, quickly on Ukraine. President Zelenskyy said he spoke to you recently about using frozen Russian assets. What is fair use in your view?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think fair use would consist of an operational loan that would be using cash balances as collaterals. And I think that the strength of the system should be based on everyone holding Russian assets to do the same thing. So, if all those countries holding assets that have cash balances available as collaterals go in the same direction of lending the money to Ukraine, to be repaid by Russian financing of the reconstruction of Ukraine, because Russia is the aggressor, then I think that that would go a long way in convincing Russia that it has to come to the table to negotiate.",

And so far, not one college has agreed to sign and at least six have rejected it.",
      "The compact, reviewed by CBS News, states that universities pledge not to use race or sex in admissions and hiring, freeze tuition for five years, cap international enrollment at 15 percent and require standardized testing.",

      "On Thursday, we spoke with three professors who represent the views of their respective faculties. Jeri Seidman of the University of Virginia, Leila Hudson of the University of Arizona, the Miki Turner the University of Southern California. We began by asking about the administration's request for schools to create an environment that doesn't, quote, \"punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas.\"",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "JERI SEIDMAN (Professor, University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce): So, belittling speech is obviously not something that any university would want. However, as a state university, we are required to abide by the Constitution. And so, while a private university could decide to limit the free speech of faculty, staff or students if that university decided to, as a state institution, nobody can require the University of Virginia to limit the free speech or any other constitutional right of faculty, staff or students.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Professor Hudson and Professor Turner, how do you all think your university is going to interpret that kind of guidance? Do you think, first of all, that that is happening on your campuses? And then, how is that supposed to be regulated with this federal mandate?",
      "MIKI TURNER (Professor, USC Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism: I am on a task force, a provost (ph) task for academic freedom. Academic freedom and freedom of speech are two different things. But what we're working toward is to, you know, find that common ground between academic freedom, what professors and students can or cannot do in the classroom. And I don't think that this initiative will happen at USC. I can't \u2013 I can't see a situation where we would want to limit what we say, how we say it, and what we do as a university.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, can you go back to this idea that is being introduced here, that in the view of the Trump administration, this is actually a problem that needs to be fixed, that there is belittling or violence against conservative ideas on university campuses.",
      "LEILA HUDSON (Professor, University of Arizona School of Middle Eastern and North Africa Studies): Well, I would push back against that. Again, as a public research university, we are an open marketplace, if you will, of ideas. So, you're going to hear all kinds of speech. We have institutional rules that prevent harassment and certainly violence.",
      "But in terms of trying to regulate the speech, that, indeed, will violate, not only the academic freedom that makes our universities great, but the constitutional rights of the university community.",
      "So, I think that, again, this will require a lot more discussion and, indeed, resistance. And I've been very heartened, both on our campus and across the country, to see people rising up against anything that would silence any voices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the specific accusation that there's a problem of, you know, belittling and sparking violence against conservative ideas, do any of you object to trying to counter that, or is it that none of you believe that that's actually even a real problem?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: The University of Virginia has taken the ability of people to cordially or speak to each other with courtesy but differing opinions very seriously. And we have a number of initiatives on grounds to try to advance that. So, we definitely think it's something important and we want to make sure that those, you know, isn't happening on our campuses. I don't think it's happening to the extent that it gets reported.",
      "But the thing that's really important is that each university should determine how those are implemented on their universities, what their issues are and have the decentralized decision-making ability to decide whether their university has an issue and how to deal with that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Hudson, you were talking about the open marketplace of ideas here. And that is referring to the language in the compact that talks about the need to foster \"a vibrant brant marketplace of ideas.\" But in these terms, it's suggesting that that doesn't exist. That the overwhelming, you know, persuasion of the professors on campus are liberal. That seems to be the accusation here. Do you deny that that is an issue?",
      "LEILA HUDSON: Well, I don't think it's an issue that the federal government needs to weigh in on or any other level of government. Indeed, we have traditions, we have understandings, we have an ironclad commitment to the principles of free speech that mean that any systematic or chronic silencing of any individual's voice or perspective would immediately be identified and rectified by more speech, not by government intervention. So, I'm very comfortable that we can continue to improve climate on campus. But the act of introducing government regulation into that absolutely undermines and sabotages that project.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, in terms of where the Trump administration's compact came from, there were a lot of influences. But one of them, according to the man himself, is billionaire Mark Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management. And he said he helped write the compact because \"without government involvement, reform at universities will be difficult,\" he argues. He says there have been \"government mandates\" on things like \"diversity, on discrimination and student discipline,\" so why view these at any different?",
      "Why is he wrong?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: We were talking about academic freedom. And I think in our ability to search for the truth in research, we also have responsibilities in the classroom that are different than you would experience in a corporate setting. And so, I read the compact differently than he does. I think the thing that I struggle with the most about the compact is the idea that it rewards loyalty as opposed to focuses on advancement of the truth.",
      "As a cancer survivor, I want federal research funds to go to the universities and the professors who have the best ideas to cure cancer. That's the way to advance knowledge. And academics, that's really \u2013 we are truth seekers. The compact says, you know, truth seeking is a core foundation of institutions of higher education. And I completely agree with that portion of the compact, it's just the implementation of that truth seeking that I think we differ on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the \u2013 the compact says that if this proposal is not signed on to by the university, they may choose to \"forgo federal benefits.\" If you do sign on, there's a chance of increased funding and federal partnerships. So, it's not explicitly threatened, but it's strongly suggested that that would be the consequence. That's how \u2013 how your \u2013 how the university understands it?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: That's how I believe most faculty understand it that I have heard from.",
      "Something interesting is that, even faculty who have grants have reached out to me and said, you know, we \u2013 we want the grants to go to the places that have the best ideas. We don't want to have special treatment. Faculty are truth seekers. And so, we don't \u2013 we don't want special benefits. Even if that means that our university is not favored because others do sign on, we all want the best ideas to be advanced.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the state government front, there's also pressure at - - in Virginia and in California. In Virginia, Democrats in the state Senate wrote, \"if UVA signs this thing, there will be significant consequences in future budget cycles. Out in California, Professor Turner, Governor Newsom vowed to cut off billions in state funding if anyone signs this thing. And the White House says that's like California\"endorsing discrimination, tuition hikes and confronting speech with violence.\" If you're between those two pressure points, what do you do?",
      "MIKI TURNER: That's \u2013 that's a great question because I really have complete empathy for our college presidents who have to deal with this situation right now because they are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place because of all this political ping-pong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Seidman, on the pressure from the Democrats in the state of Virginia, is that helping or is that hurting?",
      "JERI SEIDMAN: Pressure from both sides definitely feel \u2013 definitely feels it.",
      "I think the difference between the pressure from the state level and the pressure from the federal level is the state funds that come from the university are the university's to determine how they use. The federal funds that we get are either for students for financial aid or are for specific grants. So, the threats to remove funding are a little bit different in that regard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor Turner, one of the things that got a lot of attention from both parties during the campaign was also just the high cost of college and university tuition right now.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: USC is the highest tuition of any private university in this country. We were looking at it before. And I was floored. It cost $75,000 a year in tuition. It gets close to $99,000 a year, inclusive of expenses. There are a lot of parents who would hear, oh, a five-year freeze in tuition and be glad that it went into effect.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Exactly. And that's one of the components I'm in agreement with, about the freeze on tuition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it also wants to cap the number of international students that you have, which would impact USC because you're above that 15 percent threshold.",
      "MIKI TURNER: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does one premise fight the other? Can \u2013 can you bring the cost down if you cut out the university students who are paying full boat coming from overseas?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Not at all. Not at all. We would not be able to do that because, you know, they \u2013 they essentially come with cash in hand. And not only that, do they add to the financial pot, but they also add to the collective perspective. And so, we want those students there from every country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to bring up one of the things that was raised here, and that is, we know the Supreme Court struck down race-based admissions. One of the first points in this compact addresses the issue of preferential treatment, as they refer to it, based on identity. They list, sex, nationality, gender, religion, race or political views.",
      "Professor Turner, you work on recruitment, I understand. How does this impact recruiting students?",
      "MIKI TURNER: Yes. If that goes into effect, that's going to affect the way I do things. But I don't think that it's going to have a huge impact on the way USC really does things. You know, we actively recruit, you know, students from all walks of life, of all races. And I don't think that, you know, we should stop that because, again, you know, we're thinking about these students. And we're thinking about their growth and how they are going to go out into the world and change this world for the better. And to \u2013 in order to do that, they need to engage with different types of people with different cultures.

      "\"We should be able to wrap this up this week, if they will sit down and have a negotiation with us,\" Kelly said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "Democrats and Republicans remain dug in on their positions on Day 19 of the government shutdown, which has become the\u00a0third-longest funding lapse\u00a0in modern history. Last week, an effort to advance a House-passed measure to fund the government fell short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate for a tenth time, as Republicans sought to peel off support from Democrats. But they've been unable to win over additional support since the shutdown began, as most Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for reopening the government.",
      "Republicans in Congress have insisted that there's nothing to negotiate as Democrats have sought to sit down with GOP leaders and the president. Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that he's told Democrats he's willing to guarantee a vote on the tax credits, though he can't guarantee an outcome. And in a post on X Friday, the South Dakota Republican added that he's willing to sit down with Democrats on the health care issue, but only under the condition that the shutdown ends.",

      "\"What we need is to fix this skyrocketing premium \u2014 they're going to go up on Nov. 1 for people,\" the Arizona Democrat said, referring to an expected jump in health insurance premiums if Congress doesn't extend a set of enhanced tax credits. \"What we need to do is fix this health care premium issue and open the government.\"",
      "Though there have been conversations between lawmakers about how to reopen the government, congressional leaders have not met since the shutdown began, last gathering on Sept. 29 for a meeting with President Trump at the White House.",
      "\"The president has spent one hour negotiating this issue with leadership in Congress. That's it, one hour,\" Kelly said. \"They need to get in the room and stay in a room until we can hash this out.

      "\"There are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people,\" Britt said. \"And so getting the government open is number one.\"",
      "On extending the health insurance tax credits, Britt reiterated that Republicans are willing to discuss the issue, but only once the government is reopened.",
      "\"We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible,\" Britt said. \"They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.\"",
      "Britt said it's \"absolutely totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump called Colombia's president an \"illegal drug leader\" on Sunday and pledged to end U.S. aid to the South American country, following the leader's criticism of U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.",
      "Mr. Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro in a post on Truth Social of \"encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields.\"",
      "\"It has become the biggest business in [Colombia], by far, and Petro does nothing to stop it, despite large scale payments and subsidies from the USA that are nothing more than a long term rip off of America,\" the president said, continuing in all caps: \"AS OF TODAY, THESE PAYMENTS, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF PAYMENT, OR SUBSIDIES, WILL NO LONGER BE MADE TO COLOMBIA.\"",
      "Hours earlier, Petro accused the U.S. in a series of X posts of hitting a fishing vessel in a strike it carried out last month, not a boat carrying drugs as it had claimed at the time. The Colombian leader said a fisherman had been killed in the attack, saying that in doing so the U.S. had \"invaded national territory.\" He made a similar allegation earlier this month, claiming another boat that was struck by the U.S. military carried Colombian citizens \u2014 which the U.S. denied.",
      "Petro's intervention has added to mounting scrutiny of the administration's strikes, which it has characterized as being part of a broader effort to combat drug smuggling and stem the flow of narcotics into the U.S.",
      "It comes after a U.S. strike Thursday on a vessel in the Caribbean Sea, the sixth known attack in the area since last month, and the first in which survivors were reported. Mr. Trump said Saturday that the two survivors, one from Ecuador and the other from Colombia, would be returned to their countries of origin.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said in his post Sunday that the U.S. will no longer offer payments and subsidies to Colombia, claiming that the country's drug production is intended for \"the sale of massive amounts of product into the United States, causing death, destruction, and havoc.\"",
      "\"Petro, a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won't be done nicely,\" the president said.",
      "Petro pushed back on Mr. Trump's allegations in a post on X, arguing that he has been the primary foe of drug trafficking in his country in recent years. Petro later said Mr. Trump had been \"rude and ignorant\" toward Colombia.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration added Colombia to its list of countries it deems as failing to uphold its responsibilities to control drug trafficking for the first time in almost three decades. The department said that under Petro's leadership, \"coca cultivation and cocaine production have reached record highs while Colombia's government failed to meet even its own vastly reduced coca eradication goals.\"",
      "At the same time, the administration issued a waiver allowing Colombia, a traditional U.S. ally in anti-drug trafficking efforts, to continue to receive aid.",
      "It is not clear what U.S. payments to Colombia will now be cut off.",
      "Petro, the first leftist elected president of Colombia in decades, has repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration in recent weeks. In addition to his criticism on social media, he denounced the strikes on alleged drug boats in a speech before the United Nations last month and later, during a New York protest event, encouraged members of the U.S. military to \"disobey\" Mr. Trump's orders. The move prompted the State Department to announce it would revoke Petro's visa.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats have also drawn backlash from neighboring Venezuela, which has accused the Trump administration of aggression. The administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with drug cartels, which he has denied."

    "story": [
      "Frozen meals served to students across the United States as part of federally-funded school breakfast and lunch programs may be contaminated with listeria and have been recalled, officials announced on Saturday.",
      "The recall applied to approximately 91,585 pounds of prepackaged breakfast burritos and wraps, manufactured by the California company M.C.I. Foods between Sept. 17 and Oct. 14,\u00a0said the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture that focuses on public health regulations.",
      "Its announcement cited seven different types of frozen breakfast products that could be tainted. They are distributed to low-income students around the country as part of the National School Breakfast and Lunch Programs, which the Department of Agriculture administers. The breakfast program served more than 14 million children in 2016, and close to 30 million children participated in the lunch program in 2019, according to the department.",
      "There are no confirmed reports of illnesses tied to the recalled products, which include burritos and wraps sold by the brands El Mas Fino, Los Cabos and Midamar and contain egg, cheese and various meats like beef, ham, sausage and turkey, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The agency said it recalled those products after the manufacturer discovered listeria while conducting routine testing on egg ingredients from its external suppliers.",
      "\"FSIS is concerned that some product may be in institutional refrigerators of freezers,\" said the agency. \"Institutions are urged not to serve these products. These products should be thrown away.\"",
      "Listeria is an infection caused by bacteria of the same name that spreads through food. Fever, headache, stiff neck, muscle aches, confusion, loss of balance and a range of gastrointestinal problems are some of the symptoms brought on by the illness,\u00a0according to the Mayo Clinic. The clinic warns that pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are at the highest risk of developing a harmful infection.",
      "People can be infected with listeria without becoming seriously ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has estimated that listeria is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., with 1,250 people contracting the infection and 172 dying from the infection each year.",
      "Public health officials note that flu-like symptoms caused by listeria can signal an \"invasive\" infection, meaning one that has spread from the gastrointestinal tract, where symptoms may start, to other parts of the body. These invasive infections typically develop within two months of eating contaminated food, according to the CDC.",
      "Multiple listeria outbreaks have been reported just this month. One impacted meal kits from the food subscription service HelloFresh\u00a0and another forced the recall of nearly 245,000 pounds of precooked pasta, from the California company Nate's Fine Foods, which turned deadly and potentially contaminated dozens of different products sold in grocery stores nationwide"

      "Our commentary is from former New York Times columnist Charles Blow, on a disappearing staple of communities everywhere:",
      "Local news is in crisis. By some estimates, more than 3,200 print newspapers have vanished since 2005.",
      "According to the nonprofit Rebuild Local News, the number of newsroom employees has declined 60 percent since 2000 \u2013 a collapse comparable in scale to the coal industry. And on average, two newspapers close each week.",
      "Public radio and public television are also part of the ecosystem of local news, and they, too, are now under threat after the government clawed back $1.1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "To better understand this problem, I partnered with the MacArthur Foundation and Press Forward, a national coalition investing hundreds of millions of dollars to strengthen local newsrooms. For nearly two years, I traveled the country, speaking with policymakers, news entrepreneurs, reporters and residents, both to write about the crisis and to work on a documentary about it.",
      "What surprised me most was the broad recognition, on the ground, of how central these outlets are to community life, and the tremendous sense of loss when they disappear.",
      "The focus of these outlets was not only on \"big J\" journalism \u2013 accountability reporting that fulfills the Fourth Estate's mission to hold power to account. It is also on \"small j\" journalism \u2013 wedding announcements and obituaries, profiles of valedictorians and roundups of high school games. This connective tissue of local news strengthens communities and makes them whole.",
      "This also explains why people, even as they distrust or dislike national media, often embrace their local outlets.",
      "The perception of local news is shifting from a struggling industry to an essential public good. These newspapers are neighbors. They strengthen neighborhoods. Without them, division grows.",
      "A 2019 study by Harvard University's Nieman Lab found that \"[t]he decline of local newspapers and the 'nationalization' of political news are polarizing vote choice.\"",
      "Local news reminds us how much we have in common \u2013 that we are communities first, not partisan enemy combatants.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:24:57 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has instituted new rules governing a library that straddles the border between Quebec and Vermont, restricting access to visitors from Canada.",
    "story": [
      "There is still a place where you can walk freely across an international border, no questions asked. The only protest is the squeaking floorboards near the well-worn boundary line painted on the floor. This is the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, a Victorian palace to art, culture and education that actually has dual citizenship, because part of it sits in Stanstead, Quebec, while the other half stretches into Derby Line, Vermont.",
      "It was the vision of Martha Stewart Haskell, a wealthy Canadian who married a wealthy American. She had it built in 1901 as a gift, and it was built straddling the border specifically so it could welcome both communities. \"At that time, this was family, both sides,\" said American Kathy Converse, who has been volunteering here for 20 years.",
      "She's seen kids and parents, tourists and residents, French speakers and English speakers all coming and going freely.",
      "But this month, it changed.",
      "Converse said, \"And it's just sort of \u2013 I'm gonna stick with my one word that I use for the situation: Sad.\"",
      "In January, the same day President Donald Trump was sworn into office, U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland was shot and killed during a traffic stop about 15 miles from the library. A Seattle woman has been indicted for his murder. Hundreds turned out on the streets of Burlington, Vt., in January to say goodbye.",
      "A week later, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem flew to Vermont to pay her respects. She also made a surprise visit to the library.",
      "Asked how that visit went, Sylvie Boudreau, president of the library's board of trustees, replied, \"I have to say she was very polite with me.\"",
      "But a few weeks after Noem's visit, Boudreau was notified the building's literary loophole was closing, ending Martha Stewart Haskell's century-old vision of cooperation. \"I'm getting emotional,\" Boudreau said, \"because [Haskell's] first mission was really to reunite people, not to divide.\"",
      "Starting this month, Canadians are no longer allowed to use the U.S. sidewalk that leads to the library's grand front entrance. Instead, they have to report to a legal U.S. port of entry first. In the back of the library, on the Canadian side, was a rarely-used emergency exit. They turned that exit into an entrance, not as welcoming to Canadians as the front perhaps, but for now, it'll have to do.",
      "\"It's like when you're losing a friend, a dear friend,\" Boudreau said. \"You know, like, you backstab me and it's gonna take a while before I forgive you.\"",
      "Canadian Susan Rothwell wasn't about to take a chance: \"We didn't DARE cross that border,\" she said.",
      "A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the changes were necessary because of incidents of \"smuggling and illicit cross-border activity around the library.\"",
      "\"Around the library? Outside? Yes,\" said Boudreau. \"We have people crossing, often. But it's not because of the library, you know?\"",
      "She should know \u2014 Boudreau worked for the Canadian Border Services Agency for 20 years.",
      "\"To think that the library, because of one little sidewalk, would have that big of an impact on border security, for me, it doesn't make a lot of sense,\" said Jody Stone, the mayor of Stanstead, Quebec, who is just as well known in Derby Line, Vermont. \"If you look at the community, if it wasn't for the borders, you wouldn't know that it was two separate countries. We share water and sewer. Our fire departments come to each's other's aid when needed. We've tried to keep it as open as possible.\"",
      "Take a drive down Canusa Street (as in Canada/USA Street), so named \u00a0because the border is essentially the yellow line down the middle of the road. On the American side one sees signs of support and solidarity. On the Canadian side, a morphing of our two flags into one. Stone said, \"I'm proud to be in a community where our neighbors appreciate us as much as we appreciate them.\"",
      "That back entrance will eventually be getting a make-over. A donation box shows that the dollars don't discriminate; American and Canadian currency proves that both sides want to make it right.",
      "Despite all the noise outside, in here, under the mournful eyes of a massive moose, the Haskell Free Library and Opera House remains a place where no sides are taken, where differences are celebrated, and where the promises of the past are kept.",
      "Boudreau said, \"It's like all that politics and all these rulings don't exist. We are here for all the same thing. It is literacy, culture, and friendship.\"",

      "\"Life is not a private affair. A story and its lessons are only made useful if shared.\" Dan Millman, Way of the Peaceful Warrior",
      "Just a few hours ago, a visit to the Louvre seemed like a brilliant way to cheer myself up. But now the sadness overtakes me. I am so far from home.",
      "It is June 2021, and I am on the second floor of the world's largest art museum, surrounded by strangers and yet very much alone. It is a weird time to be in Paris, which has just reopened after the COVID\u201119 pandemic swept the globe, and the streets are largely empty of tour\u00adists, who have only now been allowed to fly into France. I look like a tourist \u2014 another blond American mom in blue jeans and ballet flats. But I did not come to Paris to sightsee. I am here to do a job that never gets any easier. I'm here to stand up to those who have hurt me. I am here to reclaim my life.",
      "Leaving my hotel this morning, I felt strong. The sun sparkled and the air was warm, as if to make fun of all the sweaters I'd packed. I thought of my husband, Robbie, back in Australia, where we live. I knew he was hosting a sleepover for our three kids and three of their friends, and I could imagine him, frazzled as he telephoned our favor\u00adite pizza place and ordered way too many pies. \"You are my little war\u00adrior,\" my husband likes to tell me, and he said it again before I boarded the plane from Perth to Paris. I can't always see myself as Robbie does, but today as I set off on foot and headed toward the Seine, I felt connected to his fierce ideal of me.",
      "From my hotel on Rue Scribe, I easily found my way to the Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra and headed south toward the Louvre. It had been twenty years since I'd walked these streets, but it seemed as if I knew the route. Visiting the museum was a gift I'd decided to give myself: a few hours away from my lawyers and their questions. For days they had been grilling me, and I understood why. In order to maximize the im\u00adpact of the testimony I was here to give, I had to be focused \u2014 ready for anything. But I badly needed a break. When a morning off pre\u00adsented itself, I knew exactly where I wanted to go. Now I made a beeline for the Louvre's iconic metal and glass pyramid, scanned my ticket, and rode the escalator down. My plan was to relax and wander the galler\u00adies, escaping my ugliest memories by immersing myself in pure beauty.",
      "For a while, everything went as I'd imagined. I lost myself in the larger-than-life bronze and marble sculptures, texting my husband photos of The Four Captives, a quartet of soldiers in shackles, and of Hercules fighting an oversized snake. I was in no rush. I figured I'd get to the Mona Lisa eventually. But then, unsure exactly where I was going, I climbed a flight of stairs, turned a corner, and froze. I know this room, screamed a voice inside my head. I'd been in this precise spot before \u2014 two decades ago, when I was just seventeen.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:21:01 -0400",
    "summary": "She was a 16-year-old employee at Mar-a-Lago in 2000 when she says she was recruited into Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. Before her death by suicide earlier this year, Giuffre wrote a memoir, \"Nobody's Girl,\" and sought the release of the Epstein Files.",
    "story": [
      "If the tragedy of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring had a face, it might've been Virginia Roberts Giuffre. At a 2019 press conference she said, \"I was recruited at a very young age from Mar-a-Lago, and entrapped in a world that I didn't understand, and I've been fighting that very world to this day.\"",
      "Before she died from suicide last April at the age of 41, she wrote an unflinching memoir, \"Nobody's Girl,\" with the hope it would be published in case of her death.",
      "Co-author and journalist Amy Wallace spent more than four years writing with Giuffre, who was celebrated for her honesty \u2013 and questioned, by some, about the accuracy of her memories.",
      "Wallace said, \"What she always said to me was, 'I may not remember days, times, dates. But when you have a man raping you, his face six inches from your own, you remember that face.'\"",
      "Giuffre said Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her to the sex ring in 2000 when she was a 16-year-old working at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, and she was quickly immersed in Epstein's world of money and depravity.",
      "Maxwell is now serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking, and has reportedly sought a presidential pardon (something President Trump has not publicly decided for or against).",
      "Wallace believes Maxwell should not be pardoned: \"She did not just procure. She did not just keep the date book of what girls came when,\" she said. \"No, this woman participated in the sexual abuse, and she should absolutely not be pardoned.",
      "\"Only one of us is telling the truth\"",
      "In 2021, Giuffre famously sued Britain's Prince Andrew, to whom she said she was trafficked for sex three times, starting when she was 16. \"He knows what happened; I know what happened,\" she told the BBC in 2019. \"And only one of us is telling the truth.\"",
      "The prince repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but settled with Giuffre the following year, and issued a statement saying he regretted his association with Epstein.",
      "But the rumors kept flying, and Andrew became a distraction for the crown. So, just this past Friday, he announced he was giving up all his royal titles, including Duke of York.",
      "And he, Giuffre wrote, was only one of many.",
      "Asked whether Giuffre believed that the Epstein Files which have not yet been released contain the names of other men who abused her and maybe others, Wallace replied, \"She didn't just believe it; she knew it. She knew what she'd told them. And some of those names are not public.\"",
      "\"So, authorities have those names in the Epstein Files?\" I asked.",
      "\"Presumably, if somebody kept them in a file cabinet in an efficient way,\" Wallace replied.",
      "Giuffre also believed there might be a trove of videotapes from cameras in Epstein's homes. And in recent months, there's been mounting pressure from people who want the president to authorize the release of all of the Epstein Files. Virginia Giuffre was one of them.",
      "Asked whether Giuffre had mentioned Donald Trump in their discussions, Wallace replied, \"Oh, she absolutely did. She was a huge Trump fan because he campaigned on releasing the Epstein Files.\"",
      "\"But she never talked about him in any sense that he was involved in any of this?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" said Wallace. \"He was not, as far as she knew. And again, she was there for two-plus years, but as far as she knew, he was not involved in the ring of trafficking that Epstein was working.\"",
      "Giuffre also writes that her sexual abuse ordeal started at home. She says her father, Sky Roberts Sr, started abusing her when she was seven years ago. He didn't respond to our requests for comments, but he told Amy Wallace he never abused his daughter.",
      "Virginia's brother, Sky Roberts, and his wife Amanda, say they believe her. \"He knows what he did,\" said Roberts.",
      "\"He denied it in the book,\" I said. \"You know, Amy reached out to him, and he said, 'Absolutely not. I would never touch my daughter.' You don't believe that?\"",
      "\"I believe my sister,\" Roberts replied.",
      "\"It's like a modern 'Handmaid's Tale'\"",
      "And as for Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, Giuffre said his abuse went beyond sexual assault \u2013 like ordering her to tuck him in at night.",
      "Wallace said, \"She would go in, she would pull the covers up. He didn't want sex. And she was instructed to stay with him until he fell asleep.\"",
      "I said, \"It just struck me because this is a young woman who wasn't nurtured all that much as she grew up, and here she's turning around and having to perform this nurturing act to her abuser?\"",
      "\"It's one of the reasons that Epstein and Maxwell said to her repeatedly, 'You would make a great mother,'\" said Wallace.",
      "Giuffre went on to say that they asked her to carry a child for them, and sign away her parental rights.",
      "\"It's like a modern 'Handmaid's Tale,'\" Wallace said. \"And interestingly, that was the straw that broke the camel's back for her.\"",
      "Years after Giuffre left Epstein, she was tormented by what she said she suffered at his hands. She married, moved to her husband's native Australia, and became a mom \u2013 and a voice for abuse survivors. But there was turmoil at home.",
      "Shortly before she died, she told People magazine that her husband, Robert Giuffre, physically abused her. But the courts granted him a restraining order \u2013 and custody of their three children.",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" Robert Giuffre's attorney said that since the case is still pending, Robert and the children were \"very limited in their ability to respond to the various unfounded allegations.\"",
      "Virginia's brother Sky and sister-in-law Amanda say the loss of her children might've helped push Virginia over the edge.",
      "Sky also disputed conspiracy theories suggesting Virginia had not taken her own life: \"I was with her in her final days. I mean, I was the one that found my sister when she had passed.\"",
      "In \"Nobody's Girl,\" Giuffre wrote: \"My goal now is to prevent the emotional time bomb that lives inside me from ever detonating again.\" Asked what she believes happened, Amanda said, \"The worst thing that could happen to a mother: Her children, she was separated from her children. And that is something that she couldn't bear. That was something she couldn't \u2013 I don't think any mother could handle.\"",
      "Virginia Giuffre left behind an account of her life that is both illuminating and heartbreaking \u2013 a window into the mind of a young girl preyed upon by demons \u2013 and a woman who fought them to the end.",
      "Asked who Virginia was to him, Sky Roberts replied, \"To me, she was always my protector. You know, I was her little brother. But she just had this strength inside of her that I think if you had the opportunity to meet her, was just courageous. \u2026 She was unlike anybody that you'd ever met.\"",
      "Amanda Roberts said, \"I think it's always important to remember that she was also human, and vulnerable, and beautiful, and funny, and beautifully flawed, and strong. She was just amazing. I think like he said, there was nobody like her.\"",

      "According to the recall notice, dated Oct. 10, the 360-degree camera system in affected Ford vehicles may not display rearview images properly in certain lighting conditions, hampering the driver's ability to see behind them, thereby increasing the risk of a crash.",
      "The recall includes certain 2020-2022 F-250 SD, F-350 SD and F-450 SD models.",

Nearly 1.1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles were recalled in May because of a software problem that could cause the rearview camera image to malfunction when the car is in reverse, the NHTSA\u00a0said.\u00a0 An additional recall in July due to a similar issue involved more than 200,000 vehicles.",
      "Steering issues",
      "Ford Motor also recalled 115,539 vehicles from its Super Duty truck lineup because of a potential loss of steering issue involving the steering column upper shaft detaching from the steering column.

    "summary": "Russell Vought said the Army Corps of Engineers is pausing more than $11 billion in \"lower-priority projects,\" including in New York, San Francisco, Boston and Baltimore.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The head of the White House Office of Management and Budget said Friday that the Trump administration will be pausing more than $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects, including in four Democratic-led cities, continuing its efforts to increase pressure on Democrats as the government shutdown is poised to extend into another week.",
      "\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects. The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore,\" Russ Vought, director of the budget office, wrote on X.",
      "He said additional information would come from the Army Corps of Engineers. It's unclear whether the \"lower-priority projects\" being paused include others beyond those in New York, San Francisco, Baltimore and Boston, which are all located in states represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has been targeting federal dollars going to projects in Democratic-led cities and states since the early days of the shutdown, which entered its 17th day on Friday and is set to continue into next week. The Trump administration has so far\u00a0frozen roughly $18 billion for a pair of infrastructure projects in New York City,\u00a0canceled $8 billion for climate-related efforts in 16 states and withheld $2.1 billion for infrastructure projects in Chicago. All of the states that would benefit from the funds are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has also overseen a plan to lay off thousands of federal workers amid the ongoing shutdown. Federal agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices last week, and Vought estimated that the number of government employees impacted could exceed 10,000.",
      "A federal judge, however, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with the job cuts, saying during a hearing in San Francisco that they appeared to be politically motivated.",
      "The Trump administration's moves appear aimed at ramping up the pressure on Democratic lawmakers to support a GOP-backed stopgap funding measure. Democrats have resisted backing the plan, which passed the House last month, and are instead pushing for an extension of enhanced health care tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. They also want to undo cuts to Medicaid that were part of Mr. Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" passed earlier this year.",
      "Democrats have so far been unmoved by the pressure by the Trump administration, with a 10th vote in the Senate to resolve the logjam failing on Thursday."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 12:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Democratic National Committee panel has drafted proposed standards to help the party decide which states will be the earliest to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries.",
    "story": [
      "Powerful members of the Democratic National Committee will soon decide how states will be chosen to be among the first to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries, moving the party closer to one of the most important decisions it will make in the coming years.",
      "CBS News has learned that at a meeting later this month, the party's influential rules and bylaws panel will focus on the application process to be among the first handful of states to hold a Democratic presidential nominating contest.",
      "Earning one of these prized slots is likely to bring about outsized power in the political process. With that influence comes major attention from candidates, a potential economic boost and the chance to play a role in how Democrats message and campaign on major topics and issues as the party tries to find a path forward after stinging losses in last year's presidential election.",
      "A source familiar with the calendar efforts detailed the materials written by the co-chairs of the party's rules and bylaws panel, including a draft resolution and request for proposal, were shared Friday with members. At the late October meeting, members will have a chance to revise and vote on the work.",
      "The resolution outlines standards, which according to the source, cover the following:",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;\u00a0Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;\u00a0Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;",
      "Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;",
      "Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "The plans call for four or five states to be chosen by DNC members to hold a nominating contest in what's known as the \"early window,\" which comes before states begin voting in large numbers on Super Tuesday and the weeks afterwards. Under the draft, each of the four regions being focused on by the DNC, the East, Midwest, South and West, would need to have at least one state from its respective areas be chosen.",
      "The work comes after Democrats overhauled the early voting calendar during Joe Biden's time as president, jettisoning the Iowa caucuses from being the first state to have its say on a presidential nominee. Party leaders followed Biden's push to instead install South Carolina, whose primary revived his 2020 presidential primary campaign, in the top voting spot instead.",
      "New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden had struggled to a fifthplace primary finish in 2020, was given the chance to remain an early voting state but was moved down to sharing its primary day with Nevada. The general election presidential battleground states of Georgia and Michigan were selected to round out the list.",
      "The perceived pushback against New Hampshire was derided by Democrats from the state, who have a tradition of intensely defending its first-in-the-nation primary status and have a state law to help it try and do so.",
      "In early 2024, the state held a primary outside of the DNC process before South Carolina voted, resulting in Mr. Biden's not filing in New Hampshire's contest. Allies, however, rallied behind a robust write-in campaign for him in New Hampshire. Mr. Biden easily won without his name even being on the ballot, which calmed tensions between first-in-the-nation advocates and Biden supporters.",
      "Any state can apply for the early window slots. While South Carolina was the first DNC approved primary last year, it's not certain it will be picked to start the calendar again. While the southern state is reliably red in general elections, Mr. Biden's view, as shared in a 2022 letter, invoked South Carolina's diversity when he urged DNC members to \"ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window.\"",
      "New Hampshire is expected to try to regain its place as the first 2028 DNC primary state with a pitch that can be made about the state's tradition, small size, voter engagement and ability for unexpected candidates to succeed. Democrats in Nevada however are also already making a case that the presidential battleground state out West should go first instead.",
      "In an August memo, Nevada State Democratic Party Executive Director Hilary Barrett argued that \"elevating a union-strong, diverse, highly competitive battleground state will lay the groundwork to help Democrats win back working-class voters and voters of color. If we fail to rebuild that coalition, we won't win back the White House.\"",
      "There's potential that Michigan, a state crucial to Democrats' chances of winning the presidency, could rise to the top slot, given the party's hope that early primary attention and investments may help a Democratic presidential candidate carry the state's electoral votes in 2028."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military struck another alleged drug-carrying vessel on Friday, killing three people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Sunday. It is the seventh known attack since last month.",
      "Hegseth said Friday's strike targeted a boat linked to Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, a Colombian guerrilla group that the U.S. has considered a terrorist organization since the 1990s. He alleged in a post on X that the boat \"was traveling along a known narco-trafficking route, and was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics.\"",
      "The defense secretary said the strike took place in international waters and within the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean Sea.",
      "\"The United States military will treat these organizations like the terrorists they are\u2014they will be hunted, and killed, just like Al Qaeda,\" Hegseth wrote.",
      "At least 32 people have been killed in U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats. The Trump administration has said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" President Trump told reporters last week.",
      "The strikes have drawn some pushback from lawmakers who have pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, and argue the administration hasn't made the case that the attacks are legally permitted.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that he believed the legal justification offered to members of Congress was \"very convoluted.\"",
      "\"They had a very hard time explaining to us ... the legal rationale for doing this and the constitutionality of doing it,\" Kelly said. \"The brief we got had a tremendous number of holes in it, and they had to go round and around to give us the legal rationale for doing this.\"",
      "The Venezuelan and Colombian governments have also criticized the strikes. This weekend, Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of hitting a fishing vessel in one of its strikes. Mr. Trump later called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and threatened to cut off U.S. aid to the South American country."

      "The break-in happened in broad daylight while tourists were already inside the Louvre, the world's most visited museum. It was forced to close in the aftermath of the incident as authorities began to investigate. Police sealed the museum gates and visitors were ushered out. No injuries were reported, according to spokespeople for the Louvre.",
      "\"A robbery took place this morning at the opening of the Louvre Museum,\" French Culture Minister Rachida Dati wrote on X, while the museum cited \"exceptional reasons\" for the closure.",
      "Dati called the strike the work of \"professionals,\" describing it on TF1 TV network as \"a four-minute operation carried out without violence.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez previously told France Inter radio that the heist took seven minutes and the thieves used a disc cutter to slice through the panes. He said it was \"manifestly a team that had done scouting.\"",
      "The heist occurred at around 9:30 a.m., when several people broke into the Louvre through the Galerie d'Apollon and stole jewelry before fleeing the scene on motorcycles, a museum spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"An investigation has begun, and a detailed list of the stolen items is being compiled,\" the statement said. \"Beyond their market value, these items have inestimable heritage and historical value.\"",
      "France's ministers of culture and interior were at the Louvre and working with the museum's management as well as law enforcement, the statement continued, adding that \"all possible measures are being taken to recover the stolen items.\"",
      "The interior ministry similarly said that forensic work was underway Sunday morning and a precise inventory of the stolen items was being compiled.",
      "Video from the scene showed confused tourists being ushered out of the glass pyramid and surrounding courtyards as officers shut the iron gates and closed nearby streets along the Seine.",
      "The Galerie d'Apollon is a vaulted hall in the Denon wing that displays part of the French Crown Jewels beneath a ceiling painted by King Louis XIV's court artist, according to the ministry.",
      "French daily Le Parisien reported the thieves entered via the Seine-facing facade, where construction is underway, and used a freight elevator to reach the gallery. After breaking windows, they reportedly took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon and the Empress. One stolen jewel was later found outside the museum, the paper reported, adding that the item was believed to be Empress Eug\u00e9nie's crown and that it had been broken.",
      "Security around the marquee works remains tight. The Mona Lisa is protected by bulletproof glass and a custom high-tech display system as part of broader anti-theft measures across the museum.",
      "Staffing and protection have been flashpoints at the Louvre. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions have warned that mass tourism strains security and visitor management.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday's theft.",
      "In January, President Emmanuel Macron announced a decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan \u2014 roughly \u20ac700 million to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece its own dedicated gallery by 2031 \u2014 but workers say relief has been slow to reach the floor.",
      "The theft, less than half an hour after doors opened, echoes other recent European museum raids.",
      "In 2019, thieves smashed vitrines in Dresden's Green Vault and carried off diamond-studded royal jewels worth hundreds of millions of euros. In 2017, burglars at Berlin's Bode Museum stole a 100-kilogram (220-pound) solid-gold coin. In 2010, a lone intruder slipped into Paris's Museum of Modern Art and escaped with five paintings, including a Picasso.",
      "The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia, a former worker who hid inside the museum and walked out with the painting under his coat. It was recovered two years later in Florence \u2014 an episode that helped make Leonardo da Vinci's portrait the world's best-known artwork.",
      "Home to more than 33,000 works spanning antiquities, sculpture and painting \u2014 from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to European masters \u2014 the Louvre's star attractions include the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.

      "Israel and Gaza implemented the first phase of President Trump's 20-point peace plan\u00a0last week, with a ceasefire taking effect in Gaza after Israeli troops pulled back to a predetermined line. Since then, Hamas has released 20 living hostages and the remains of 12 others. Meanwhile, Israel has released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who have been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",

      "Unlike its official name, the Demilitarized Zone, the 248-kilometer (155-mile) -long, 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) -wide border is guarded by land mines, tank traps, barbed wire fences and combat troops. Satellite imagery from last year shows North Korea had started construction on what appears to be tranches of wall near its border with South Korea.",

    "story": [
      "The Metropolitan Police in London said it is \"actively looking into\" a newspaper report that Prince Andrew asked an officer assigned to him as a bodyguard \"to dig up dirt\" on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre in 2011.",
      "The report, in the Mail on Sunday, said that Andrew provided the bodyguard with Giuffre's date of birth and confidential social security number to try to find out if she had a criminal record or any potentially damaging information about her just before the U.K.-based newspaper was due to publish a photo of Giuffre's first meeting with the prince.",
      "It's not clear if the officer complied with the request. Giuffre's family said she didn't have a criminal record.",
      "The report follows Buckingham Palace's announcement on Friday that Andrew had agreed to relinquish his royal title Duke of York and other British honors after emails emerged showing he had remained in contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein longer than he had previously admitted.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "Giuffre, who\u00a0died by suicide\u00a0in April,\u00a0sued Andrew\u00a0in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. She has accused Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, of trafficking her to Andrew. The two\u00a0reached an out-of-court settlement\u00a0in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "The emergence of the emails was another blow for the House of Windsor after years of tawdry headlines about Andrew's dodgy friends and suspicious business deals.",
      "The move to insulate the monarchy from Andrew's scandals has been ongoing since November 2019, when he gave up all of his public duties and charity roles after a disastrous interview when he sought to counter media reports about his friendship with Epstein and deny allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old Giuffre.",
      "Andrew was widely criticized for failing to show empathy for Epstein's victims and for offering unbelievable explanations for his friendship with the disgraced financier.",
      "The BBC interview, in which he said he cut off contact with Epstein in 2010, came back to haunt him and sowed the seeds for his demotion when it emerged that he had emailed Epstein 12 weeks later. Prince Andrew told Epstein in the note that they were \"in this together\" and would \"have to rise above it.\"",
      "British Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, who was serving as the government's representative on the Sunday morning news programs, said a police officer should not be enlisted in a smear campaign.",
      "\"These are deeply concerning allegations,\" Miliband told the BBC. \"I think people want to look at those allegations and what the substance is behind them. But if that is correct, that is absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used.\"",
      "In his statement on Friday, Andrew said he continues to \"vigorously deny\" the accusations.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, a title he was given at\u00a0birth."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 19, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde. The ECB sets interest rates for many countries in the European Union, which is America's largest trading partner. Good to have you here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Lovely to be back, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: From where you sit, how would you describe the state of the global economy?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: In transformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Transformation.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Transformation, I think caused by a couple of things. One is the tariffs, which have changed the map of trade around the world and reconstituted new alliances and reformed the way in which we trade with each other. I think the second major transformation is the impact of artificial intelligence on everything we do from data management to dating and everything in between.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely, and it's changing how we even receive the data itself --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- Yep. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- to indicate what's happening, but the stock market has been up and down. I want to talk to you on the other side of this commercial break about some of the specifics with these trade wars and what else you're seeing in Europe, but we're going to take a quick break here. And we have more questions, but we have to come back in just one moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We return to our conversation with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. You said the economy is in transformation. S&P Global forecasts Trump's tariffs are going to cost global businesses upwards of $1.2 trillion this year, with a lot of those costs passed along to consumers themselves. You've said that many economists overestimated the impact of Trump's tariffs. Does that mean you think we've moved past the point of risk or are we yet to feel the pain?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think we're yet to feel the pain. What we observe, I'll give you some numbers. From Europe to the United States, our goods to the U.S. consumers had a tariff of 1.5. With the tariff that was decided by the U.S. administration, it's gone up to 13%. So the question is, where does this additional 11-ish percentage point go? At the moment, it's one-third on the exporter, so the European company, one-third of the U.S. importer and one-third of the consumer. What will happen, though, is that these two-thirds borne by two corporates, essentially, the exporter and the importer, is based on a squeeze of their margins. How long are they going to put up with a squeeze of the margin, to be seen. And when they don't, because it's becoming too tight, then it will be on the consumer. So it's a question of time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much they can stomach the hit --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- Yep. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- to their own profits before passing that along. Well, there are talks happening, we understand, between the world's two largest economies. The Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on social media he's going to meet with China's Vice Premier in the coming days. This was after he called the negotiator unhinged recently, and President Trump said that starting November 1st there will be new tariffs as retaliation for Chinese restrictions on rare earth exports. These are the largest economies in the world. Where does this go? How damaging does this get?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: First of all, I would discount a little bit of the positioning at the moment because this is typical of negotiating tactics on both sides. Typical. You show your muscles and you say that you're ready to kill. I'm exaggerating, of course. But people will have to come to the table because it's the interest of both economies, despite the hostility that there is between the two. But China is using an advantage that it has built over the course of time by accumulating rare earth and the ways to refine rare earth and then to sell it to the rest of the world. They have a very, very strong trading position on that front and they're going to use it, which is why I think that on the other side the consumers, that is the United States, Europe and a few other countries around the world, we should, you know, join forces and be a purchasing force on the other side of the table of a selling force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly to that point, there has been frustration on the American side of it that Europe hasn't been standing lock step with the United States when it comes to China. That China has leverage over Europe here.",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: Well, China currently has leverage against most countries that consume rare earth. And I think on the front of rare earth, the Europeans and the Americans are in the same boat and they are rowing in the same direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's other items that you see --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- Well, I think, you know, it's not for me to say I'm just a central banker, but the European authorities and the U.S. administration see it slightly differently. I think it's the U.S. would see a blanket force. I think the Europeans are more interested in targeting specific industries or specific sectors where they think that it will make a difference. So it's a question of tactics that they will be discussing, I'm sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have also said recently that you think investors have begun to question whether the dollar would still warrant its status as the ultimate safe haven currency. I mean, the American dollar is one of the strongest weapons, frankly, that the administration has to use. Do you think that it is the rise of cryptocurrency that is most threatening to that or why are you worried?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I see signs that the attraction of the dollar is slightly eroded, and future will tell whether there is more erosion of that. But when you look at the rise of cryptos, number one, when you look at the price of gold. Gold is typically, in any situation, the ultimate destination for safe haven. Price of gold has increased by more than 50% since the beginning of the year. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So people are worried. --",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: -- That's a clear sign that the trust in the reserve currency that the dollar has been, is and will continue to be, is eroding a bit. In addition to that, we've seen capital flows outside of the U.S. towards other destinations, including Europe. So, you know, for a currency to be really trusted you need a few things. You need geopolitical credibility. You need the rule of law and strong institutions. And you need, I would call it, a military force that is strong enough. I think on at least one and possibly two accounts, the U.S. is still in a very dominant position, but it needs to be very careful because those positions erode over the course of time. We've seen it with the Sterling Pound, you know, way back after, after the war. But it happens gently, gently, you don't notice it and then it happens suddenly. And we are seeing intriguing signs of it, which is why I think that having a strong institution with the Fed, for instance, is important. Having a credible environment within which to trade is important. So volatility, uncertainty, to the extent it is fueled by the administration, is not helpful to the dollar.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly on Ukraine, President Zelenskyy said he spoke to you recently about using frozen Russian assets. What is fair use in your view?",
      "CHRISTINE LAGARDE: I think fair use would consist of an operational loan that would be using cash balances as collaterals. And I think that the strength of the system should be based on everyone holding Russian assets to do the same thing. So if all those countries holding assets, that have cash balances available as collaterals, go in the same direction of lending the money to Ukraine to be repaid by Russian financing of the reconstruction of Ukraine because Russia is the aggressor, then I think that that would go a long way in convincing Russia that it has to come to the table to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Christine Lagarde, always great to hear your insights. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Katie Britt, Republican of Alabama, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 19, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Republican Senator Katie Britt, who joins us from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Welcome to 'Face the Nation', Senator.",
      "SEN. KATIE BRITT: Thank you so much for having me, Margaret, I appreciate it. Look forward to being on here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about a lot of things. Let me just pick up where Senator Kelly left off on the shutdown. He said, hey, you could all hash this out this week, Leader Thune made that offer. I know you have said you also are concerned insurance premiums are going to go up whether Congress extends the tax credits related to Obamacare that Democrats are campaigning for, or not here, basically. Do you want this extended?",
      "SEN. BRITT: First off, Margaret, we need to reopen the government. Democrats need to come to the table and do the right thing. Just as I've been traveling the state this weekend, I have heard countless stories of people who are not getting a paycheck, whether it's our men and women in uniform or those who serve alongside them, or whether we're talking to veterans or we're talking to just a number of people. When we're looking what's happening with WIC, there are a lot of people that are being affected by the Democrats playing politics, and they need to actually do what's right, and that is work for the American people. And so getting the government open is number one. So we need to vote on the CR and open the government back up. We've also given alternatives, like end government shutdown, and I think you'll see this week if the Democrats don't come to the table, us saying, look, Shutdown Fairness Act making sure that the people who are working are actually getting paychecks, because Margaret, these have real consequences for American people. And when we're talking about the ACA, look, Leader Thune said it best. We have always said we will have a conversation about this. We believe that you can walk and chew gum at the same time. Democrats, for some reason, don't think that that's possible. They need to come to the table, open the government back up, and then we're happy to have a conversation about the broken system that they created and help them get out of their own mess.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do personally think the federal government should be off offsetting some of these costs? Because we looked at the numbers, I think it's like 130,000 Alabamans are at risk of losing insurance if the tax credit goes away.",
      "SEN. BRITT: Margaret, let's- let's be honest about this. Let's go back to Obamacare, 2010. This is the affordable air- Affordable Care Act that even the Washington Post has says was never really affordable. You go to 2014 and what you see there, though, was increases made by the Democrats, and then these increases that we're talking about right now, insurance companies have said only account for about 4% of what they're talking about increasing in 2026. The underlying issue is the brokenness of Obamacare. That is the problem. And so when you think about this, you've got the 2021 premiums that they've given to everyone. Do you understand Democrats are actually asking for us to continue premiums that are going to millionaires in some cases. We've got to be more and more responsible with taxpayer dollars. And if you want these health care systems to even be able to work, then we have to have a larger conversation. But this is absolutely, totally ridiculous to sit here and say we're afraid people cannot afford their health care, but at the same time we're going to deny them their paycheck. Those two things do not match up, and Democrats need to actually be honest about it and get the- get the government back open and we're happy to have conversations as we have always said, just as leader- Leader Thune reiterated this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were in the Oval Office discussing another health care matter with President Trump this past week. He credited you with announcing- well basically explaining to him that February 2024 decision by an Alabama court that ruled frozen embryos are children. He called it a 'bad decision,' and we all probably remember what it did for those families trying to go through fertilization treatment at that time. With the changes that were announced, who's going to be able to afford this now?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Look, millions more people are going to be able to afford this because of President Trump's leadership. From the very first time I talked to him about this, Margaret, he has been steadfast and unwavering, understanding that there are people from coast to coast that have been praying to be able to start their family or expand their family, and because of infertility, here in the United States, we've seen one in eight families that are actually struggling with infertility issues. We've got about 9% of men, 11% of women who are facing these challenges. President Trump believes in being, obviously, the President that is helping hard working Americans, helping parents, helping families. He's turned the Republican Party into that which is so exciting, and we want to make sure that they're going to be able to do that at a greater- at a greater scale. And so that's exactly what this will do. Millions more will have access. And additionally, we're going to drive the cost down. And so I talked this weekend, actually with a friend of mine, who came up to me and said, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this, because the affordability issue was the impediment. And she actually had to go off- over shores- overseas to try to be able to bring life into this world. It's exciting for people like her. And I've had grandparents and parents and moms and dads tell me what a game changer this is for them as they start and grow their family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one cycle of IVF can cost between $15,000 to $20,000 and lower income women obviously have a challenge with that. But during the campaign, President Trump said he was going to make the government pay for it or make insurance companies pay for it. So do you think that the Affordable Care Act, that Obamacare, for example, should cover it? Or is it too controversial for conservatives who have a moral issue with IVF?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Well, Margaret first. I mean, the Affordable Care Act is broken, and that is what we're seeing right now. I mean, you've seen the increases that people will see in 2026. 80% of those are just Obamacare, Affordable Care Act related. And so we clearly see that the underlying structure of this program is not sustainable and is not working for the American people. No one is paying less now that Obamacare is in place. And so we've got to be super honest about that. We also have to make sure that we're being responsible moving forward. What President Trump has done is made this accessible to millions more people. He's going to continue leading on this issue and so many others\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0-- It's still not free. It's still not free, right?",
      "SEN. BRITT: \u2013 that actually support hard-working families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to legislate, though to force it to be?",
      "SEN. BRITT: What we're doing to-- what want to do is I want as many people as possible to have opportunity to bring life into this world. And that's exactly what this is doing. We'll continue to work on this issue. And we also want to support families as they have children and are able to, you know- in this environment right now, we hear from people all the time, whether it is bringing life into this world, whether it is the child care cost, just the affordability aspect. And I am so proud to see President Trump lead on these. Actually, if you look at the Working Families Tax Cut, Margaret, this is the very first time we have actually increased the child care tax credits and also the DCAP tax credits in 20 years in some instances, and 40 in others. So we're trying to make sure that people can not only bring life into this world, but that it's more affordable when they get here. Because we want people to start and grow their families. That's what this is doing. This is just- the just the start. And look forward to continuing to work for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Really quickly. You've been trying to label Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for stealing Ukrainian children. Does the President's decision to meet with Vladimir Putin endanger your efforts to get this bill passed?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Look, I am grateful for President Trump's efforts on this. If you look back, we are in this war because of President Biden. If President Biden had sent the weaponry needed to Ukraine on the front end, when we saw Russia building up. We wouldn't be in this war to start with, when you're looking at what President Trump has done, he has met with Zelensky more times in his nine months in office, then President Biden did his entire time. So, these conversations help us to have resolution--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But do you have support to help bring it to the floor?",
      "SEN. BRITT: Well, the First Lady obviously has been leading on this. We have built up support. We're having a hearing next week. I think you will see this come to the floor if there is not a resolution in the short order, because we believe in bringing these children home, Margaret. It's about 20,000 children that have been stolen from their homes. This is something everyone should be able to get behind. And Vladimir Putin should pay the price for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Katie Britt of the state of Alabama. Thank you for your time this morning, 'Face the Nation' will be back back in a minute. Stay with us."

    "story": [
      "Hamas may be planning an attack on \"Palestinian civilians\" in the Gaza Strip, the U.S. State Department announced Saturday.",
      "In a statement, it said the U.S. had informed nations that signed on to the Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump \"of credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.\"",
      "The State Department did not provide any details on the timing or location of the possible attack, saying only that it \"would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts.\" Mr. Trump's envoys met Hamas representatives to finalize the peace plan, though the U.S. continues to designate it as a terrorist group.",
      "\"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the State Department added. It did not disclose what those measures might entail.",
      "On Sunday, Hamas rejected the claims by the U.S. State Department, calling them \"false allegations.\" The group accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "This also comes\u00a0after CBS News obtained a video\u00a0on Wednesday, which shows armed Hamas fighters standing over Palestinians they have accused of being gang members collaborating with Israel. Moments later in the video, they execute them.",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News that the video depicts a long pattern of punishment that Hamas uses against suspected collaborators with Israel.",
      "\"Hamas is killing them because they can,\" Baskin told CBS News this week. \"Hamas is a criminal organization that has ruled the Palestinian people in Gaza for almost 20 years. This is not a democratic, liberal regime.\"",
      "Baskin also explained that Palestinian militia groups that are opposed to Hamas had been armed by Israel\u00a0during the war\u00a0in an effort to weaken Hamas' power.",
      "\"Israel has empowered, with weapons and money, gangs of Palestinians who were involved in mostly illegal activities in the past \u2014 selling drugs, illegal smuggling \u2014 and they've empowered them as an alternative to Hamas,\" Baskin said. \"This is not sustainable.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump acknowledged reports that Hamas was engaged in violence against rival Palestinian groups but appeared to downplay them as a concern.",
      "\"They did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad gangs, very, very bad,\" Mr. Trump said of Hamas while speaking with reporters Tuesday. \"And that didn't bother me much, to be honest with you.\"",
      "Hamas' role in Gaza's future remains murky. Israel has demanded that Hamas disarm. The U.S.-brokered peace plan calls for it to relinquish its governance of the Palestinian territory to a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" But Hamas has been quick to reassert itself, making clear that it has retain some power and organization despite Israel's efforts to destroy it.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump and world leaders signed onto\u00a0the U.S.-brokered agreement\u00a0designed to bring a halt to the two-year Israel-Hamas war.",
      "As part of the deal, Hamas released 20 living hostages, while Israel released about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israel also pulled its troops back to a preapproved line in Gaza.",
      "The deal also calls for Hamas to release the remains of 28 deceased hostages, but so far it has only released the remains of 10 of those.\u00a0Another two bodies\u00a0were released by Hamas Saturday, but they are pending identification.",
      "According to the Associated Press, Israel has so far returned to Gaza the bodies of 135 Palestinians as part of the agreement."

    "story": [
      "Jared Kushner, a key negotiator in the\u00a0Israel-Hamas peace deal, said in an exclusive \"60 Minutes\" interview that he expects the terrorist organization to employ violent tactics in an effort to reassert its power in Gaza.",
      "\"Hamas right now is doing exactly what you would expect a terrorist organization to do, which is to try to reconstitute and take back their positions,\" Kushner told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl.",
      "The interview took place just days before the U.S. warned that Hamas may be planning an attack on Palestinian civilians. Israeli forces and Hamas also clashed over the weekend, with an Israeli military official saying the country\u00a0struck targets in southern Gaza after Hamas shot at Israeli soldiers \u2014 marking a test of the ceasefire.",
      "Kushner, who is President Trump's son-in-law and helped secure the president's peace deal, said the success or failure of the 20-point peace plan will depend on whether Israel and the international partners involved can create \"a viable alternative.\"",
      "\"If they are successful, Hamas will fail, and Gaza will not be a threat to Israel in the future,\" Kushner said.",
      "The U.S. peace deal, still in its first phase, saw Hamas release\u00a020 living hostages, and so far return the\u00a0bodies of at least 10 confirmed deceased hostages.",
      "It eventually\u00a0calls for an interim governing body to run Gaza made up of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts,\" and overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump, but that has yet to be established.",
      "The expected rebuilding and post-war governance in Gaza could be derailed by violence in the decimated strip. Video obtained by CBS News\u00a0this week showed Hamas fighters executing Palestinians they accused of being gang members collaborating with Israel.",
      "Hamas has been working to use its weapons to reestablish itself as the entity that is governing Gaza. The U.S. said in a statement Saturday that attacks against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "An extended version of Stahl's interview with Kushner and Steve Witkoff will be available Sunday night on\u00a060 Minutes Overtime and the\u00a060 Minutes YouTube channel."

    "story": [
      "Israel identified the remains of two hostages on Sunday after Hamas handed over their bodies to the Red Cross the night before.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the bodies belonged to Ronen Engel, a father of three from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai agricultural worker killed at Kibbutz Be'eri. Both were believed to have been killed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack and their bodies were taken to Gaza. Engel's wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in an earlier ceasefire in November 2023.",
      "Since the Gaza peace plan took effect early this week, Hamas has handed over 20 living hostages and the confirmed remains of at least 12 hostages. The remains of at least 16 Hamas-held hostages are still unaccounted for. One of the bodies released to Israel did not belong to a hostage.",
      "The handover of remains, along with aid deliveries into Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory, are among key points in the ceasefire, reached on Oct. 10, meant to end two years of war.",
      "President Trump joined world leaders in Egypt on Monday to sign the U.S.-brokered peace plan\u00a0that saw Hamas agree to release all remaining living and deceased hostages in exchange for Israel releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "The released Palestinians include 250 people who are serving life sentences, and about 1,700 others who had been detained and held without charges since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Hamas handed over the bodies of four confirmed hostages on Monday, another three on Tuesday, and two on Wednesday. That same day, it said that it had released all the\u00a0Israeli hostage remains\u00a0in Gaza that it had been able to recover. But on Friday, it returned another confirmed hostage.",
      "And according to the Associated Press, as part of the ceasefire deal, Israel has so far returned to Gaza the bodies of at least 135 Palestinians. On Sunday, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza said Israel returned the bodies of another 15 Palestinians.",
      "A senior U.S. adviser told reporters on a call Wednesday that \"nobody is getting left behind,\" noting they believe there are still many bodies buried under the mountains of rubble across Gaza. Senior U.S. advisers said the level of destruction also makes it difficult to move around in the Palestinian territory.",
      "Mr. Trump also said in Egypt on Monday that not all of the bodies of the deceased hostages had been found, adding that unidentified parties were still \"working out\" how to locate an unspecified number of remains.",
      "Mike Waltz, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday that U.S. personnel would take part in the effort to recover the remains of hostages.",
      "Tensions emerged over the implementation of the peace plan this weekend, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violating the ceasefire in recent days.",
      "The Israeli military said on Sunday that militants shot at troops in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in the Israeli-controlled areas, according to the agreed-upon ceasefire lines. No injuries were reported. A senior Hamas official denied to the Associated Press that Hamas was involved.",
      "Netanyahu's office announced Saturday that the critical southern Gaza border crossing of Rafah, which connects with Egypt, \"would not be opened until further notice,\" saying that its opening would be dependent \"on how Hamas fulfills its part in returning the abductees and implementing the agreed-upon outline.\"",
      "Hamas responded by calling the move \"a blatant violation of the terms of the ceasefire agreement.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department issued a statement late Saturday saying that the U.S. had learned of a plan by Hamas to attack \"Palestinian civilians.\"",
      "The U.S. said it \"had informed the guarantor nations of the Gaza peace agreement of credible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.\"",
      "Hamas rejected the U.S. claims on Sunday, calling them \"false allegations\" and accusing Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the U.S. administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven.\"",
      "This comes after\u00a0CBS News obtained a video on Wednesday that showed armed Hamas fighters standing over Palestinians they accused of being gang members collaborating with Israel. Moments later, they execute them.",
      "The disturbing images are part of a long pattern of punishment meted out to suspected collaborators, Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News."

      "Hamas said Wednesday it has handed over all the Israeli hostage remains in Gaza that it has been able to recover, and that extensive efforts and special equipment are required to find the remaining bodies.",
      "The Red Cross said it received two more coffins containing the remains of deceased hostages, which were being transferred to Israeli authorities, the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli Security Agency said in a joint statement. The IDF said late Wednesday night local time that the coffins had entered Israel and were being taken to the National Centre for Forensic Medicine for identification.",
      "\"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages,\" the IDF said in a statement.",

      "Since the plan took effect last week, Hamas has been accused of delaying handing over the remains of Israeli hostages still believed to be in the Palestinian territory.",
      "While Hamas returned the 20 living hostages by the Monday deadline, the remains of only four deceased Israeli captives were handed over. Hamas transferred an additional four bodies on Tuesday, but the IDF said one of them was not a hostage. That means the remains of at least 19 hostages are still unaccounted for.",

The adviser also said Turkey has offered to help search for and retrieve remains by sending in expert teams with experience rescuing people from the frequent earthquakes in the country.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a social media post on Monday that Hamas' initial return of only four bodies constituted \"a violation of the agreement\" and added that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",

      "Senior U.S. advisers who spoke to reporters on Wednesday, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains still in Gaza, urged patience and said they are not at a point where they feel that the agreement has been violated.",
      "Even if these issues are resolved, the 20-point peace plan still faces other considerable hurdles. Hamas wants the Israeli military \u2014 which still occupies more than half of Gaza \u2014 to withdraw entirely. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that the conditions of the plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First, Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.\"",
      "But Hamas has rejected calls to disarm, and, since the start of the ceasefire, CBS News' team in Gaza has seen Hamas back on the streets, still armed, and reportedly confronting rival groups. Mr. Trump on Tuesday warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"we will disarm them,\" adding: \"It'll happen quickly and perhaps violently. But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he heard Mr. Trump's remarks, paraphrasing them as \"all hell breaks loose.\"",

The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",

      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",

      "Rubin was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s colitis as a teenager, and later with severe cancer.",
      "After visiting dozens of doctors with no success, he met a man who told him that if he were to follow a diet based on the Bible \u2014 proven through history and confirmed by science \u2014 he could be well.",
      "\"After another 40-day period of an upgraded diet \u2014 plus detoxification, and emotional and spiritual therapy \u2014 I overcame cancer that was referred to as terminal and did not undergo chemotherapy, radiation or additional surgeries,\" Rubin told Fox News Digital.",

      "Dr. Axe\u2019s own journey began while he was helping his mother overcome breast cancer.",
      "\"I put together a program for my mom that included certain foods in the Bible, like pomegranate and olive oil \u2014 and also prayer, faith, praise and worship,\" he said.",
      "\"I think the Bible is the greatest health book ever written.\"",
      "Later, when a medical procedure left Axe with a spinal infection, he again turned to a Bible-based diet and prayer, combining them with regenerative treatments to heal.",
      "\"I listened to the diagnosis of my great physician, not my ordinary physician,\" the doctor said. \"The great physician tells you to live with hope in all things and believe in the miraculous \u2014 and I did. Now I\u2019m 100% healed.\"",
      "What a Bible-based diet looks like",
      "Food is mentioned repeatedly in the Bible, and both authors believe the core foods discussed can form the foundation of a healthy modern diet.",
      "Key examples include red meat, whole-grain sourdough bread, olive oil, dairy, fruits like pomegranates and figs, and natural sweeteners, such as raw local honey.",
      "A Bible-based diet includes foods like red meat and dairy, which some have argued should be foods to avoid. (iStock)",

      "VIRAL MORNING WELLNESS ROUTINE PROMISES MORE ENERGY AND FOCUS BY NOON",
      "Olive oil, frequently referenced in scripture, supports skin, metabolism and cardiovascular health. Dairy \u2014 particularly from sheep, goats or certain dairy cows \u2014 can also be beneficial.",
      "\"The land of milk and honey was not just a euphemism,\" Rubin noted. \"Dairy can be very healthy if it\u2019s whole, raw and grass-fed.\"",
      "Raw, local honey serves as a natural sweetener and immune system booster, while unprocessed whole salt provides essential minerals. Avocados, figs and fresh fruits are other staples.",

      "\"Pigs, shrimp and other scavengers don\u2019t have the system to properly process toxins,\" Rubin said.",
      "Axe believes that living a healthy life is one important factor to living faithfully. (Courtesy of Dr. Josh Axe.)",

      "\"Fasting is one of the greatest healing breakthroughs someone can experience.\"",

      "Rubin agreed, emphasizing the importance of emotional healing as well.",
      "\"During my successful battle with cancer, I made spiritual health a priority,\" he said. \"I wrote out a prayer from the Bible and quoted it out loud three times a day \u2014 it was medicine to me.\"",
      "He also focused on forgiveness, calling it \"essential\" to his recovery.",
      "Best to consult multiple sources",
      "The authors stressed that \"The Biblio Diet\" isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution.",

      "Wahhaj, born Jeffrey Kearse, founded the Brooklyn mosque in 1981 and has a long history of controversy. Following the World Trade Center attack, prosecutors noted he sponsored appearances by Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called \"Blind Sheikh\" who was later convicted of masterminding the plot. Wahhaj wasn\u2019t charged with any crimes and has denied involvement in the attack. Wahhaj also raised legal-defense funds for El Sayyid Nosair, who assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990 and was also convicted of seditious conspiracy in connection with the 1993 bombing.",
      "Wahhaj didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",

      "For Muslims who oppose Wahhaj\u2019s ideological interpretation of political Islam, called Islamism, Mamdani\u2019s alliance with Wahhaj is a disturbing window into what his mayoral term could bring, with his allegiances to groups and leaders with Islamist sympathies and anti-American and anti-semitic views.",
      "Muslim scholar Dalia Ziada, Washington, D.C., coordinator and research fellow at the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy, said Wahhaj represents the same Islamist ideology that fueled decades of extremism in the Middle East.",
      "\"I am particularly concerned to see mosques used as political rallying platforms in the free and democratic United States,\" she said. \"By embracing Wahhaj, Zohran Mamdani is sidelining moderate Muslims and normalizing an extremist ideology that once inspired terror on American soil and still fuels radicalization within segments of the Muslim community today.\"",
      "Soraya Deen, founder of the Muslim Women Speakers Movement and a co-founder of the Clarity Coalition, a network of Muslims, ex-Muslims and allies challenging Islamist extremism, heard Wahhaj for the first time 20 years ago in a talk to Muslim youth in Los Angeles.",

      "MAMDANI SPARKS ONLINE FRENZY OVER RESPONSE TO WHETHER HE ENDORSES NY GOV HOCHUL: 'HUMILIATING'",

      "In the photo, there isn\u2019t a woman to be seen, because Wahhaj also practices the interpretation of Islam that denies women access to the main hall of mosques, believing they would sexually tempt the men praying inside. Deen said, \"Despite the gender jihad women are facing in the Muslim world, Mamdani poses for a photo op that emboldens the men suppressing women\u2019s rights.\"",
      "In June, a political action committee supporting Mamdani, \"New Yorkers for Lower Costs,\"\u00a0accepted $100,000 donations from the\u00a0\"Unity and Justice Fund,\" a political action committee tied to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a group designated an unindicted coconspirator in the trial of five Holy Land Foundation leaders. The five leaders were convicted of funneling about $12.4 million to Hamas and sentenced to decades in prison. Mamdani has included sympathetic lyrics about the \"Holyland Five\" in a rap. Earlier this year, Nihad Awad, a co-founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and a close ally of Wahhaj,\u00a0said he was \"happy\" about the Oct. 7, 2023, rampage by Hamas terrorists into Israel.",
      "Similarly, Wahhaj has preached a philosophy of exploiting America\u2019s democracy to further a conquest for Islam. In 1991, according to a\u00a0videotape of the event, Wahhaj told a gathering of Muslims:\u00a0\"I just want to say this. Brothers and sisters, in my opinion what the Muslims do in America will have a profound effect on Muslims everywhere on this earth. As long as you remember that if you get involved with politics, you have to be very careful that your leader is for Allah. You don't get in politics because it's the American thing to do.

      "Three years later, he shared his views on the U.S.,\u00a0saying, \"You know what this country is? It\u2019s a garbage can. Filthy. Filthy and sick.\"",

He has headlined fundraisers for groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, including the alphabet soup of organizations that experts consider legacy groups for the Muslim Brotherhood: the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA), and the Muslim American Society (MAS).",
      "In 2003, he\u00a0told the Wall Street Journal that a society ruled by strict Islamic law, where adulterers are stoned and thieves\u2019 hands are cut off, \"would be superior to American democracy.\"",
      "In talks, Wahhaj\u00a0denounced the U.S. government as \"controlled by Shaitan,\" the Arabic word for the devil, urged Muslims not to befriend \"non-believers,\" condemned homosexuality as \"a disease of this society,\" and supported Islamic laws that punish sex outside of marriage with 100 lashes and stoning. He denounced Muslims befriending non-Muslims, saying, \"Woe to the Muslims who pick kafirs,\" or non-Muslims, \"for friends.\"",

      "Wahhaj even instructed Muslims to bar their children from making friends outside the faith.",
      "\"Don\u2019t you know our children are surrounded by kafirs?\" he said. \"I\u2019m telling you, making the hearts of our children corrupt, dirty, foul. It\u2019s clear, the principles are clear. Birds of a feather, they say, flock together. And so, when our Muslims hang out with the non-Muslim, you become just like them. You talk just like them. You do what they do, you dress the way they dress, you act the way they act, you want to be just like them, because their hearts are corrupt, and now they\u2019re corrupting your heart.\"",
      "His personal life has also been shadowed by scandal. In 2018, three of Wahhaj\u2019s children were\u00a0arrested after authorities discovered 11 malnourished children living in a New Mexico compound where one of his grandchildren had died during an attempted exorcism.",
      "The embrace of such a figure has ignited debate over Mamdani\u2019s judgment and the Democratic Party\u2019s tolerance for radical associations. Wahhaj remains a revered figure among some Islamist activists, including Linda Sarsour, who in 2017 called him \"a mentor\" and \"my favorite person in the room.\" Sarsour left the Women\u2019s March, which she co-founded, amid accusations of antisemitism. She has led many of the anti-Israel marches since the Oct. 7 attack, leading chants of claiming Israel \"from the river to the sea.\"",

      "Here\u2019s the backstory on the Tomahawks and why Trump is keeping them on the table to pressure Putin.",
      "First tested in 1972, the Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missile, or TLAM, was actually developed by the U.S. Navy during the Cold War to attack targets on land in the Soviet Union.\u00a0In case you haven\u2019t seen one up close, the Tomahawk is 20 feet long but just 21 inches wide.\u00a0 It looks like a white pole with winglets, but inside is a powerful turbo-fan engine and sophisticated guidance.\u00a0Today\u2019s Block IV Tomahawks can be retargeted in flight, and loiter over a target for hours, taking electro-optical scans and waiting for other missiles to arrive before detonating.\u00a0They carry a unitary warhead for harder targets, or dispense cluster munitions over a wide pattern to hit airfields, for example.\u00a0(Yes, there was once a nuclear TLAM variant with a 200 Kiloton warhead, but they were placed in storage in 1991 and eliminated in 2010.)",
      "The presence of Tomahawks in Ukraine will set up an almost insoluble air defense problem for Putin.\u00a0No way can Russia place air defenses at every remote gas pipeline point or cover all the airbases where planes park out in the open.",
      "TLAMs could be in Ukraine in 24 hours.\u00a0The Army Mid-Range Capability missile system is a tractor-trailer missile launcher that can be driven onto a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane.\u00a0The Army deployed TLAM launcher 8,000 miles away to North Luzon in the Philippines in under 15 hours last year for a wargame.\u00a0Trump has plenty of time.",
      "Deterring Putin.\u00a0The brutal escalation of mass attacks by Russia led Ukraine to ramp up its drone strikes on Russian energy starting in August. According to a Reuters study, Ukraine\u2019s drones have hit 18 pumping stations, plus 32 strikes on refineries. Ukraine\u2019s Liutyi drones have a range of about 600 miles and carry warheads of about 50 pounds.\u00a0Mixing in TLAMs would intensify pressure on Russian energy, Putin\u2019s single biggest source of government revenue.\u00a0Zelenskyy has called Ukraine\u2019s drone attacks on Russian energy \"the sanctions that work the fastest.\"",
      "In this handout released by the U.S. Navy, the guided-missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG 52) launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn. (U.S. Navy via Getty Images)",
      "The U.S. still has about 4,000 Tomahawks in its inventory, and new missiles like the U.S. Navy\u2019s SM-6 are already in action.\u00a0The U.S. Army deployed its new Dark Eagle long-range hypersonic weapons to Australia in August and will have its first full battery by December.\u00a0By the way, last year Japan bought 400 Tomahawks for targeting China and North Korea.",
      "Tomahawks have piled up an incredible combat record since Jan. 17, 1991, when 122 TLAMs hit Iraqi oil and command and control targets at the start of Operation Desert Storm.\u00a0Eight-hundred TLAMs were fired in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.\u00a0Over the years, Tomahawks have hit targets in Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and, of course, Iran.\u00a0On June 22, TLAMs hit above-ground \"key surface infrastructure targets\" in the nuclear complex at Isfhahan, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.\u00a0The TLAM strikes left the sprawling site visibly damaged and blackened.\u00a0\"We gave it a capper with 30 TLAMS,\" as Trump said Friday.",
      "Putin may yell and scream about Tomahawks for Ukraine.\u00a0Pay no attention.\u00a0He\u2019s grumbled about each weapon system, from F-16s to Patriots. And no, Putin does not dare escalate with nuclear weapons in Ukraine, because the wind patterns blow radiation clouds back into Russia.",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord.

      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month. This is the same group that claims to have access to over a billion Salesforce records and is demanding ransom for those as well.",

      "What Discord is doing now and what users should do next",
      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",
      "Discord also stated that it has notified relevant data-protection authorities about the breach, is working closely with law enforcement and is auditing its third-party vendors to ensure they meet its enhanced security and privacy standards going forward.",
      "A representative at Discord issued a statement, saying in part, \"We want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online. First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.\u00a0All affected users globally have been contacted, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities and external security experts.

      "Discord cuts ties with vendor 5CA and tightens its security investigations. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "If the recent breaches are any indication, third-party services that companies rely on are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Discord's steps to contain the situation are necessary, but they highlight a bigger problem. Many companies do not implement sufficient safeguards to protect sensitive user data. Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

A new survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that nearly one in five high school students in the United States say they or someone they know has used AI to have a romantic relationship.

      "Nearly half of the students said they use AI to talk about emotions, friendships or mental health. Many admit they feel more comfortable opening up to a chatbot than to a parent or friend. Even more alarming, two-thirds of parents said they have no idea how their kids are using AI. Experts warn that while AI can simulate empathy, it has no real understanding or care. According to researchers, students need to remember that they are not actually talking to a person. They are interacting with a programmed tool that has clear limitations and cannot truly understand human emotions.",
      "AI in schools: Help or harm?",
      "AI tools are everywhere in schools. About 85% of teachers and students said they used AI during the last school year. While schools introduce AI to boost learning, this exposure may have a downside. Students who use AI more often in class are also more likely to turn to it for emotional or personal reasons.

      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",

      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",

      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history.

Officials say the system may be breaking traffic laws, and worse, causing accidents. According to Reuters, 58 reports describe Teslas blowing through red lights, drifting into the wrong lanes and even crashing at intersections. Fourteen of those cases involved actual crashes, and 23 caused injuries.",

One driver in Houston complained that FSD \"is not recognizing traffic signals,\" saying the car stopped at green lights but ran through reds.

Another investigation is looking into Tesla's limited Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, where passengers reported erratic driving and speeding \u2014 even with human safety drivers onboard. Meanwhile, Tesla is still fighting a false advertising lawsuit from California's DMV. Regulators say calling the software \"Full Self-Driving\" is misleading, since it requires constant driver supervision.

Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",

      "JEEP AND CHRYSLER PARENT STELLANTIS CONFIRMS DATA BREACH",
      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",
      "For drivers, it means less time sitting in construction zones. For local governments, it means better roads built on data, not guesswork.",

The most prominent sign of AI-generated email copy is that it looks highly formal with a dash of failed attempts to be personal. You might not notice it at first, but looking at it closely is likely to give a red flag. The language of such emails is often robotic.",

Recently, a\u00a0father lost $4 million in Bitcoin to vishing. Though\u00a0AI voice cloning has improved, it\u2019s still flawed. You can spot inconsistencies by verifying the speaker's identity. Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person. You may also consider verifying the claims through the second channel. If the person on the other side of the phone says something, you can get it confirmed by the official email to be on the safer side.",

      "A Los Angeles-based aerospace startup called Inversion Space has unveiled Arc, its first flagship spacecraft designed to deliver supplies from orbit back to Earth in record time. The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network. During an event at the company's factory, they described Arc as the next evolution of global delivery, one that starts in orbit, not on the ground.",

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

      "Why Arc's hypersonic speed could change aerospace testing",
      "Beyond rapid delivery, Arc doubles as a hypersonic testing platform. It can reach speeds over Mach 20, endure extreme heat and survive massive g-forces. Those capabilities have caught the attention of U.S. defense agencies, which are eager to improve hypersonic flight testing. Inversion's participation in the Kratos-led MACH-TB 2.0 program highlights the growing military interest in Arc's reusable design. \"Fully reusable and capable of precise landings for rapid recovery, Arc makes hypersonic testing faster, repeatable, and more affordable,\" the company said.",
      "Arc could deliver mission-critical cargo anywhere on Earth in under an hour. (Inversion Space)",
      "What Inversion learned from its first spacecraft, Ray",
      "Before Arc, Inversion launched a smaller demo craft called Ray on SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission. Ray weighed about 200 pounds and successfully tested propulsion, avionics and solar power systems in orbit. Though a short circuit prevented reentry, it provided valuable data that led to Arc's development. Ray's success convinced the company to push forward with full-scale testing. Inversion has already completed dozens of drop tests and built a full-scale Arc prototype. The startup also partnered with NASA to refine the vehicle's thermal protection system for reentry.",

      "How Arc strengthens defense and emergency logistics",
      "Inversion sees Arc as a bridge between space logistics and national defense. The spacecraft could deliver mission-critical cargo to remote, damaged or denied environments where traditional transport would take days. As Fiaschetti put it, the goal is simple: make a difference the moment it lands. By combining maneuverability, reusability and speed, Arc could reshape both emergency response and battlefield supply chains. It's not just about moving packages, it's about delivering readiness.",
      "Engineers at Inversion Space test Arc\u2019s reentry systems as the spacecraft moves closer to flight readiness. (Inversion Space)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If Arc succeeds, it could redefine emergency logistics on Earth. Imagine doctors receiving vital medical kits from orbit after a natural disaster, or soldiers getting urgent supplies in minutes instead of hours. Arc could also accelerate scientific research, enabling faster delivery of experimental payloads or orbital materials. For everyday people, this technology represents the next step toward on-demand space infrastructure, where the line between space and Earth logistics begins to blur.",

      "On page 87, Bray quoted a Danish Antifa interviewee named Rasmus Preston, who said doxxing is \"'a very important tool to create conflict within far-right movements' by causing a \u2018constant mental burden.\u2019\"",
      "In another instance, Bray relayed the story of Antifa Nebraska scoring a \"major victory\" by doxxing a political opponent, noting that the far-left group \"printed thousands of flyers with his name, photo, and information on his Nazism and plastered them around town, forcing him to drop out of college, take down his social media, and go into hiding.\"",
      "The book offers an appendix where Bray invited his interview subjects to provide advice to fellow or prospective Antifa members. A source named Brett A advocated in favor of doxxing as one of many tools in Antifa's political war.",
      "\"Ideally, you want a diverse squad with members who have different talents,\" Brett said. \"Some folks will be best used on the front lines in confrontations (usually strong, fit people who can fight if need be), some folks need to be really good with intel gathering (monitoring right-wing pages, doxxing, etc.), some folks need to be good at graphic design for flyer campaigns, some folks need to be well-versed in security culture, etc. The more diverse your organization is, the better equipped it will be at effectively organizing and staying safe.\"",
      "Brett alluded to another tactic supported in Bray's book: violence.",
      "Antifascism is not just one tactic, but many, and those include \"combinations of physical confrontations, doxxing, infiltration.\"",

      "Bray openly praised the violent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown's death involving police.",
      "\"Moreover, these riots pushed police brutality and black oppression to the forefront of the national consciousness in a way that \u2018nonviolent\u2019 tactics could not have achieved on their own,\" he wrote. \"Yes, most Americans were repulsed by the sight of looting and burning, but for once they were forced to take note of the scale of injustice. Subsequently, Black Lives Matter cultivated a very significant base of popular support despite having a \u2018violent flank.\u2019\"",
      "On page 64 of the book, Bray relayed the story of Italian Antifa groups Autonomia Operaia and Lotta Continua from the 1970s. He described those groups as \"militants wearing ski masks and bandannas, armed with clubs, iron bars, Molotov cocktails, and sometimes handguns.\"",

      "\"While the expressed purpose of such marches may have been opposition to fascism, the state and the entire capitalist system were implicated in fascist violence, and therefore legitimate targets for widespread looting and property destruction,\" Bray wrote.",
      "The book later claims that \"anti-fascism must necessarily be anticapitalist.\"",
      "Later, he described the Autonomen in Germany, a group descended from Autonomia Operaia. He fawned over the group for inventing black bloc, the now-ubiquitous black head-to-toe uniform Antifa groups wear worldwide.",
      "He described a \"direct action\" where the group \"dressed in black with their faces covered by motorcycle helmets, balaclavas, or other masks to create a uniform, anonymous mass of revolutionaries prepared to carry out militant actions, sometimes involving weapons such as flagpoles, clubs, projectiles, and Molotov cocktails.\"",
      "Censorship is viewed as a powerful tool in fighting the people Bray calls fascists, too.",

      "\"The thing about memorializing Kirk as the Socrates of our era, willing to debate me bro anywhere anytime, is how he was also a know-nothing,\" said Reznicek.",
      "Chris Lamb, a journalism professor emeritus of Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Indianapolis, who brags about being on Turning Point's \"Professor Watchlist,\" also made claims that Kirk and Turning Point caused violence.",
      "\"I'm on Charlie Kirk's Professor Watchlist. I know professors who were harassed and threatened after appearing on the list. Others were physically assaulted. Kirk's murder is a tragedy \u2013 as is any murder. But let us not praise Charlie Kirk. He was a SOB,\" he said on Bluesky.",

      "\"But there was more to him than other provocateurs. He was married with two small children. Maybe that would have motivated him to become a better version of himself if he had lived,\" Lamb said. \"It\u2019s happened before. He was not afraid to engage with people who disagreed with him. This set him apart. America really needs someone who can engage us \u2014 rather than further divide us. Maybe he could have become one of those people. We\u2019ll never know.\"",
      "Jeremy Littau, who teaches journalism at Lehigh University, also shared the sentiment of his colleagues in response to Klein's think piece.",
      "\"I have two professor colleagues who have faced threats and harassment due to the organization Charlie Kirk built, and they were not alone,\" he said on social media the day after Kirk's murder. \"We can denounce and loathe political violence without hagiography for its victims.

      "The term \"special relationship\" has been used to describe the U.S.-U.K. partnership since WWII in the face of Nazi, Germany, but many have argued it was solidified during the Cold War under the close alliance of President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margret Thatcher.",
      "This week former and current diplomats, government officials and foreign policy advisers convened in London to celebrate what would have been Thatcher\u2019s centennial birthday, and to reflect on her partnership and friendship with the late U.S. president.",

      "\"They were political soul mates, in a sense. This wasn't a forced marriage,\" Fred Ryan, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the\u00a0Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ryan explained that their relationship was so successful, in part, because they had formed a relationship prior to either of them becoming heads of state, and they shared a mutual dedication to revitalizing their economies and countering communism.",
      "\"I think the personal relationship made it more than just transactional \u2013 it made it something that was a kind of a relationship of exceptional trust in terms of what it's done today,\" Ryan, who also served as Chief of Staff to\u00a0Reagan starting in the late 1980s, said. \"Going forward, I think it's set a great example.\"",
      "Though the Reagan-Thatcher alliance is most known for pressing the Soviet Union, ardent anti-communist principles and ultimately ending the Cold War, experts this week in London argued that, perhaps more significantly, their partnership created a lasting obligation that future leaders would adhere to ensure the U.S.-U.K. partnership continued.",

      "\"[Both have] given extra weight to the special relationship, and it does appear to be something that they're both working at,\" Ryan said. \"People have seen that Keir Starmer [and] Donald Trump have been able to build a good relationship. It's an example for others to try to emulate.\"",
      "COULD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH PUTIN BE THE NEXT REAGAN-GORBACHEV MOMENT?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. relationship is once again under the microscope, not only because of how different Trump and Starmer are politically, but because both nations face the greatest threat to the West since the Cold War, once again emanating from Moscow.",

      "\"Turkey\u2019s labeling of peaceful Christian residents as \u2018security threats\u2019 is a clear misuse of law and an attack on freedom of religion or belief,\" Rieder said during the OSCE Warsaw Human Dimension Conference. \"When governments manipulate administrative or immigration systems to exclude people based solely on their faith, it undermines both the rule of law and the very principles of tolerance and peaceful coexistence that the OSCE was founded to protect.\"",

      "According to the international watchdog, Turkey\u2019s Ministry of Interior has assigned the individuals targeted by Ankara \"security codes,\" like as N-82 and G-87, which effectively bars them from ever re-entering the country as it classifies them as a national security threat.",

    "story": [
      "As one of the most in-demand head coaching candidates in the NFL, Aaron Glenn interviewed with several teams last season. But by his own admission, he wanted only one.",
      "The New York Jets.",
      "A former Jet before a highly successful career in coaching, Glenn promised changes during his introduction as New York's coach in January.",
      "\"Put your seat belts on,\" he said, \"and get ready for the ride.\"",
      "Ten months later, that ride's trajectory has gone straight down.",
      "And Sunday's Week 7 loss brought the Jets closer to the misery the franchise hoped Glenn's appointment would make a thing of the past.",
      "In a 13-6 loss to Carolina that dropped the Jets to 0-7, including 0-5 at home, New York benched the quarterback, Justin Fields, it had paid $30 million guaranteed to sign as a free agent only last spring.",
      "It's just the third time in the Jets' 65-year history, joining 1996 and 2020, that it has started a season 0-7, and Glenn is the franchise's first coach to lose his first seven games.",
      "The Jets, the NFL's lone remaining winless team, continued multiple worrying trends that have contributed to their winless season \u2014 uneven quarterback play, a porous offensive line and an inability to force turnovers on defense.",
      "\"We have to be able to pull out these low-scoring games,\" Glenn said Sunday. \"The thing is, our guys are fighting. There's no quit.\"",
      "The Jets, who own the NFL\u2019s third worst winning percentage (.350) since they last made the playoffs in 2010, are accustomed to head-shaking results. They entered last season with Super Bowl ambitions with quarterback Aaron Rodgers healthy, only to fire their coach and top football executive en route to a 5-12 record. Late in the season, The Athletic reported that the teenage sons of owner Woody Johnson influenced some roster decisions and that one trade had been nixed because the owner felt a player's rating in the video game \"Madden\" was not high enough. (A Jets spokesperson at the time said the sons' input was \"used as a reference point.\")",
      "This season was intended to be a new era. Following the criticism of 2024, Johnson reportedly gave up some measure of control over team decisions, and the team's new management cut loose Rodgers and signed Fields, a former high first-round pick. Then, in Week 1, they had to watch Rodgers gloat after he outdueled Fields to beat his former team.",
      "New York did not sign Fields, expecting a quarterback known more for his mobility than his passing ability, to dramatically change his game. Yet by Week 6, things had gone backward. Fields threw for only 45 yards, and New York finished with a franchise-worst minus-10 yards net passing.",
      "Entering Sunday, the Jets owned the NFL's third-worst offense and 20th-ranked defense. Still, the matchup against the Panthers appeared to offer one of New York's best opportunities this season for its first win. Though Carolina had won two consecutive games, it was hardly formidable, having been outscored overall for the season. The Panthers' defense ranked 21st in points allowed.",
      "Yet the Jets' offense was again impotent. It produced only 12 first downs on 11 drives and failed to score a touchdown in the first half for a sixth consecutive game \u2014 the first time the franchise has done that since 2000. With the ball near midfield in the final minute before halftime, the Jets did not even try to throw a Hail Mary, the first half instead ending on a sack.",
      "Trailing 13-3 in the third quarter, the Jets benched Fields, which Glenn, who had previously supported Fields, said was his decision. Fields\u2019 backup, Tyrod Taylor, went on to throw two interceptions.",
      "Fields said he was \"a little bit\" surprised but \"can't be mad at the decision,\" he told reporters. \"I understand why.\"",
      "Even as Carolina lost its starting quarterback, Bryce Young, to an ankle injury late in the third quarter and never scored again, the Jets still could not take advantage. Particularly eye-opening has been New York's inability on defense to force turnovers; it has produced just one, fewest in the NFL, in seven games. Glenn's defense in Detroit last season finished in the top third of creating takeaways.",
      "\u201cObviously, wins cure a lot in this league,\u201d said Taylor, Fields\u2019 successor. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t had a chance to put one of those together.",
      "\"The message has to be the same, the work has to still be done throughout the week, and us coming out and executing at a high level, one play at a time, is what we need on game day. Not spurts of it, not a quarter of it, not a half of it, but for a full four quarters.\""

I know who made that. I know who made that. And also, he listened to me!\u2019 He did amazing. It was like, you really know me. I didn\u2019t know what I would want, but he did somehow, and that\u2019s kind of a flex.\u201d",

      "Jewelry is somewhat of a new career path for Lubeck, 30, who is originally from Jacksonville, Florida and graduated Florida State University with a degree in psychology. The daughter of a jeweler, Lubeck started making her own designs in 2019 at the age of 25, she shared in an Instagram reel.",

      "\"Love Is Blind\" and \"Married at First Sight\" are two reality series that ask participants to surrender to daring marriage experiments.",
      "\"Love Is Blind\" launched on Netflix in 2020, and has spawned multiple international versions, from France to Brazil. \"Married at First Sight\" was adapted from a Danish version of the show. It began in 2014 on FYI, later moving to Lifetime and, as of 2025, Peacock.",
      "Whether you've watched one or both of the series, there are some clear similarities and differences between the two. Below, we're breaking down how the shows compare.",
      "The Concept",
      "If you've never watched \"Love Is Blind,\" the concept is quite simple. Singles meet in dating pods separated by a black wall. By taking physical looks out of the equation, the show tries to see if people form deeper, more authentic emotional connections. Only by getting engaged can the couples come face-to-face.",

      "Unlike \"Love Is Blind,\" couples commit to marriage before getting to know each other then start working with a group of experts to strengthen their relationship.",

      "\u201cI do not mind spending 10 dollars on a pastry if they are really good, but you cannot use fake-ass ingredients,\u201d Griffo said in the controversial review, while holding a pistachio croissant. \u201cThat pistachio color is about as natural as my boobs, ass and waistline.\u201d",
      "She was similarly harsh regarding the shop\u2019s coffee, which she deemed \u201csuper sour and acidic,\u201d and its quiche, which she said had a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d crust and so much egg, she \u201cwould have eaten an omelet\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cFive dollars for a canel\u00e9? I didn\u2019t even pay that in San Tro-f---ing-pez,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the price next to the Phoenix Airport? OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",
      "Griffo did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",

      "That video didn\u2019t go over well, either: After even more backlash, Griffo deleted all of her videos, changed her username and posted an apology.",
      "\u201cMy review was not revenge for being turned down for a collaboration I had already planned to visit and review the bakery regardless, paid or not,\u201d Griffo wrote in the text-based TikTok. \u201cBut I understand with how things unfolded, it might have looked like I did it out of spite. That\u2019s not who l am, and that was never my intention.\u201d",

I respect the time, effort, and heart that goes into running a small business, and I genuinely wish you nothing but success moving forward,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. Sometimes we mess up publicly and all we can do is take accountability, learn, and grow from it.\u201d",

      "The baker says that people have been opting for the pistachio croissant most, of course, followed by the pumpkin croissant, an item that was on special last weekend.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my community. I\u2019m very proud that I stood up for what we do, and my team, and I think the truth spoke for itself, and the way people stood up really, truly amazed me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have ever imagined to see this in my life, truly, and I feel so blessed and amazed that people are supporting us the way they are, and people have been so nice, so patient this weekend. It\u2019s mind blowing.\u201d",
      "Leurquin also says some of the harsher backlash Griffo is receiving is not what she wishes on her.",
      "\u201cI know she is getting some death threats and stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very intense on her side but in a negative way. That\u2019s something that we never meant to have happen.\u201d"

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian spoke about co-parenting her four kids with ex-husband Kanye West in a new interview on Alex Cooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian has opened up about the \"narrative\" that she keeps her four children from seeing their father, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and how she has \"never once done that.\"",
      "The reality star and beauty mogul spoke with Alex Cooper for the Oct. 15 episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast about how she co-parents with Ye. Kardashian, 44, also spoke about what made her finally seek a divorce from the controversial rapper, the last time he spoke with their children, and why she decides to stay silent when Ye posts screeds about her online.",
      "Kardashian and Ye, who were married from 2014 to 2022, share children North, 12, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 6.",
      "\"What do you think co-parenting with Kanye West is like?\" Kardashian asked when Cooper broached the subject. \"It\u2019s not easy, but I raise the kids, full time. They live with me, and I welcome a great, healthy relationship with my kids and their dad, and I think he knows that.",
      "\"I push for it all the time, but I also protect them when it\u2019s time for that. And it goes in waves and phases, and it\u2019s a lot of work.\"",
      "Kardashian also shared the last time the children have been in contact with their father.",
      "\"Whenever he\u2019ll call for them and ask,\" she said. \"It\u2019s probably been a couple months since we\u2019ve heard from him. They always knew that he had a big life traveling before and was always on tour and all of that, and that he lives in different countries all the time and loves to live all over the place. We manage it really well.\"",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Ye for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Kardashian tries to keep her focus on her children.",
      "\"They love their life and their routine and their schedule,\" she said. \"And I think just the job as their mom is just to make sure that they stick to their routine, and they\u2019re healthy and happy.\"",
      "She also addressed the speculation that she does not let her kids see their father.",
      "\"Look, it\u2019s not easy no matter what, co-parenting with anyone. I think that the one thing that just gets me is that there\u2019s this narrative that I keep the kids away from him,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve never once done that.",
      "\"There\u2019s been so many times where I\u2019ve been like, 'Ah, I just want to show all of these texts. What are you talking about?' Like, we just haven\u2019t heard (from Ye),\" she continued. \"I beg them to go hang out or things like that.\"",
      "Ye has accused Kardashian on social media of not allowing him to see the children, which she has denied.",
      "\"It\u2019s more of just the narrative that, like, I think it\u2019s all good and we\u2019re living our life, and then I just wake up and there\u2019s all these tweets about how I\u2019ve kidnapped the kids,\" Kardashian said. \"And I\u2019m like, it\u2019s not a kidnapping, it\u2019s a divorce, you know? We can still all be in each other\u2019s lives and have group dinner.\"",
      "Kardashian said her mother, reality star Kris Jenner, says she needs to give it \"five years of being divorced\" before \"everyone can coexist and be friends.\"",
      "\"Every time he has asked, I will always let them see their father,\" Kardashian said. \"That\u2019s just who I am. If there\u2019s a time where it\u2019s just really super unhealthy, I will say, 'Hey, let\u2019s do it here at my house, or let\u2019s figure out a different time.' But actually when he is like that, he doesn\u2019t really want to see the kids a lot.\"",
      "Kardashian said Ye has lived in Saudi Arabia, Italy and Japan, and she has \"never once denied\" her children going to visit him.",
      "\"I don't keep the kids, and I think that all that narrative really sucks for me,\" she said. \"And if I spoke out about it and rebutted it, I\u2019m just not that girl online that\u2019s going to, like, fight back and be like, 'Wait a minute, your assistant and you said you wanted a whole different birthday party, and you said your party\u2019s at 4 (o'clock), so we did ours at noon, and now you\u2019re going online saying (something else).' It\u2019s just a totally different narrative than what the reality is, and that just really sucks.\"",
      "Ye has previously said derogatory things about Kardashian on social media, but she does not respond.",
      "\"There has been so many times where I\u2019ve written a draft and been like, 'I\u2019m going to go,'\" she said. \"And then I\u2019m just like, 'What\u2019s the point? What is the point? Am I going to go back and forth? My kids are going to see this.' They\u2019ll figure it all out when when they want to make those decisions. And I used to be so protective and so 'hide everything,' and then sometimes you just can\u2019t hide it all.\"",
      "\"I never say anything negative about my kid\u2019s dad just because it\u2019s out there,\" she continued. \"Like, the last thing my kids need is for them to hear it from me. And I never saw my parents talk bad about each other no matter what was going on. I do think that that\u2019s just who I am. I just don\u2019t want to go there with, like, fighting back, saying negative things, you know?\"",
      "That's not to say she hasn't thought about it.",
      "\"I wish I did last time,\" she said. \"I had a good post ready to go.\"",
      "She added that it's hard for her to stay restrained when Ye has said negative things online about her mother.",
      "\"That\u2019s what\u2019s really hard for me, because she loves him, and to this day still does and is super emotional about it and sad about it. It was a big part of our lives,\" Kardashian said. \"My kids, I say such positive things about their dad that, like, North had to say to me, 'Mom, I think you go upstairs and, like, cry at night. Like, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s time to move on. You need to have a boyfriend now.' And I\u2019m like, 'Wait, what? What? I cry? No, I'm getting a massage upstairs. What do you think is happening?'\"",
      "Kardashian also shared why she split with Ye, between him saying negative things about her mother and sisters and airing out \"personal stuff.\"",
      "\"Just not feeling safe, not even physically, just, like, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" she said, adding, \"We had, like, five Lamborghinis, and I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d all be gone if he was in an episode. And I\u2019d be like, 'Oh, wait, where\u2019s all our cars? My new car.' And it would be like, 'Oh, he gave them away to all of his friends.'\"",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get when you wake up,\" she continued. \"And that\u2019s, like, a really unsettling feeling. Lack of stability was a big thing.\""

I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,\u201d Spears wrote. \u201cThe conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged President Donald Trump to get tougher with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, saying he was ready to join their upcoming summit in Budapest and remained optimistic despite leaving the United States without the weapons he was seeking.",
      "The Ukrainian leader told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview taped Friday that Trump needed to apply even more pressure on Putin than he had applied to Hamas during his recent success in securing a ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "\u201cPutin is something similar but more strong than Hamas,\u201d Zelenskyy said. The war is bigger and Russia\u2019s army is the second biggest in the world, he added, \u201cand that\u2019s why more pressure\u201d is needed.",
      "Zelenskyy had hoped that part of that pressure would be the delivery of long-range U.S. Tomahawk missiles that could be used to strike deep into Russia.",
      "Trump had publicly floated the possibility of providing Tomahawks to Ukraine, but appeared to limit expectations about an agreement when he met with Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday, one day after a phone call with Putin.",
      "Zelenskyy, who spoke to NBC News shortly after that visit, said it was \u201cgood that President Trump didn\u2019t say \u2018no,\u2019 but for today, didn\u2019t say \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d",
      "Putin has warned that supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine would be a \u201cqualitatively new stage of escalation.\u201d Zelenskyy said that Putin is \u201cafraid that United States will deliver us Tomahawks. And I think that he [is] really afraid that we will use\u201d them.",
      "Trump announced after his call with Putin that he would meet with the Russian president in Budapest, Hungary, for a second round of in-person talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy called Putin a \u201cterrorist\u201d during his interview with NBC News, but reiterated his willingness to meet with the Russian president face to face.",
      "\u201cIf we really want to have just and lasting peace, we need both sides of this tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can there be some deals without us about us?\u201d",
      "Asked if he would push to go to Budapest, Zelenskyy said he had told Trump: \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s last bid to get the two leaders to meet fizzled out after initial optimism, with the Kremlin rebuffing U.S. efforts.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s latest visit to the U.S. came as Russia hammered Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure with drones and missiles in the past week, leading to blackouts across the country. Ukraine has been carrying out its own campaign targeting Russia\u2019s energy supply in a bid to impose economic pain on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe are not losing this war, and Putin is not winning,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Russia was stepping up airstrikes across Ukraine because of its \u201cweak position\u201d on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why he really escalates airstrikes,\u201d Zelenskyy added, saying Putin wants an \u201cenergy disaster this winter by attacking us.\u201d",
      "Trump said in a social media post after meeting with Zelenskyy that Ukraine and Russia \u201cshould stop where they are,\u201d and that it was time to \u201cstop the killing, and make a DEAL.\u201d",
      "Russia currently controls nearly 44,600 square miles, or 19%, of Ukraine, including a major chunk of territory in the east and southeast of the country, according to open-source maps of the battlefield.",
      "Asked if he was willing to negotiate or give up some territory in order to end the war, Zelenskyy said: \u201cIf we want to stop this war and to go to peace negotiations urgently and in diplomatic way, we need to stay where we stay, not to give something additional to Putin.\u201d",
      "Peace talks have to take place in quiet, he added. \u201cNot under missiles, not under drones.\u201d",
      "Asked whether Trump can end the war, Zelenskyy said: \u201cGod bless, yes.\u201d"

The group alleges Israeli forces have killed civilians, delayed the release of detainees and blocked aid delivery, warning that Israel would be responsible if the deal collapsed.",
      "Hamas\u2019 armed wing said it was \u201cunaware of any events or clashes taking place in the Rafah area,\u201d adding that the area was under Israeli control and that its contact with groups there had been cut off since the collapse of a previous ceasefire in March. It also affirmed its \u201cfull commitment to implementing everything that was agreed upon, foremost among which is the ceasefire.\u201d",
      "The truce between Israel and Hamas came into effect on Oct. 10, when the group agreed to release all Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees under the first phase of a deal brokered by the United States.",

      "Israel says Hamas is delaying the release of the bodies of hostages held inside Gaza, while Hamas says it will take time to search for and recover remains.",

      "LONDON \u2014 It's safe to say they're making their presence felt.",
      "Japan's top sumo wrestlers were wandering the streets of London earlier this week ahead of the sold-out Grand Sumo Tournament currently taking place at the Royal Albert Hall, the British capital's famous Victorian concert venue.",
      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",
      "His rival, Hoshoryu, was the 74th man to attain the rank.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that sumo is back after so many years,\u201d Onosato told Sky News, NBC News\u2019 broadcasting partner, on Wednesday. \u201cI hope I can show the U.K. fans how fantastic sumo is.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",
      "Their carefully structured, high-calorie meals are vital for building the size and strength needed to compete at the highest level.",
      "\u201cWe are going through 70 kilos of rice a day,\u201d Donagh Collins, the CEO of Askonas Holt, an arts company which helped to organize the event, told Sky News. \u201cSomebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles,\u201d he added.",
      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",
      "The wrestlers, who weigh a combined six tons, slapped, gripped and lifted each other, as spectators reveled at the sight of the centuries-old Japanese sport.",
      "Around eleven tons of clay were brought into the hall to build the dohyo, the raised ring where the wrestlers compete, outlined with rice bales shaped and secured using beer bottles, according to Reuters.",
      "The two grand champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, each secured victory in their bouts, closing the evening with weighty performances \u2014 literally."

      "Despite being scattered across oceans and continents, the protests are connected by the frequent appearance of the same emblem: a pirate flag from a globally popular Japanese anime series.",

      "Frustrated by chronic power and water shortages, young people in Madagascar, an island nation off southeastern Africa, first took to the streets of the capital, Antananarivo, on Sept. 25.

      "As in the protests in Nepal, Indonesia and elsewhere, the focus of the movement in Madagascar \u2014 a former French colony of about 30 million people that is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries \u2014 broadened from a lack of basic necessities to anger over inequality, corruption and widespread political impunity.",
      "Soon, young protesters in Madagascar, where the median age is 19, were demanding the resignation of Rajoelina, 51, who came to power in a military-backed coup in 2009.",

      "The supply of aid remains critical in Gaza, United Nations agencies have warned, as Israel continues to keep closed key border crossings that are vital to getting food into famine-hit areas.",
      "Israel\u2019s military earlier this week informed the U.N. it would halve the amount of aid expected to enter Gaza due to the slow release of the remains of Israeli hostages, a key point of contention between Hamas and Israel.",
      "The bodies of three hostages were returned to Israel in the last day and the ceasefire continued to hold, however, the United States issued a warning to Hamas should it try to violate the deal with an attack on Palestinians.",
      "The World Food Programme is supplying approximately 560 tons of food every day, its spokesperson, Abeer Etefa, told reporters on Friday. However, the agency is facing challenges in ramping up the quantity, as key crossings remain shut, and in its delivery, due to destroyed roads.",
      "\u201cThe first stop is that the Israelis open [these crossings]. It is very important to have these openings in the north,\u201d Jens Larke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Friday. \u201cThat is where the famine took hold.\u201d",
      "Etefa said there are only two operational crossings, and none in the north, where the crisis is the most acute.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still below what we need. But we\u2019re getting there,\u201d she said. \u201cRoads are blocked and destroyed, which is a huge limitation to transport.\u201d",
      "Remains returned to Israel, Gaza",
      "Israel says Hamas is delaying the release of the remaining dead hostages inside Gaza, while Hamas says it will take time to search for and recover bodies buried under rubble.",
      "On Saturday afternoon, Israel said it had received the bodies of two hostages, leaving the bodies of 16 more in the enclave.",
      "The IDF on Sunday identified one set of remains as those of Ronen Tommy Engel. The identity of the second person has not been publicly released.",
      "The IDF earlier said it had received the remains of a hostage later identified as Eliyahu Margalit, 75.",
      "Engel and Margalit, both from Kibbutz Nir Oz, were killed on Oct. 7 and their bodies taken into Gaza, the IDF said.",
      "The Ministry of Health in Gaza said Saturday that it had received the bodies of 15 Palestinians released by Israel, some of which it said showed signs of beatings and abuse.",
      "The IDF has not responded to requests for comment from NBC News on the allegation that returned bodies have shown signs of torture.",
      "On Saturday, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that the Rafah Crossing between Gaza and Egypt would remain closed \u201cuntil further notice\u201d after earlier plans to reopen it, citing the hostage remains disagreements. The opening \"will be considered depending on how Hamas fulfills its part in returning the abductees,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "Fragile ceasefire",
      "Even as the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel holds, Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces.",
      "Israeli forces killed at least nine people in a bus on Friday, the Gaza Civil Defense agency said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The IDF said its troops had \u201copened fire\u201d at the vehicle, which had crossed the \u201cyellow line.\u201d The IDF had fired \u201cwarning shots\u201d initially, but the vehicle continued its approach in a way \u201cthat caused an imminent threat,\u201d it said. \u201cThe troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement,\u201d the IDF added.",
      "That line separates the area Israeli forces still occupy from the areas that it has withdrawn from as part of the ceasefire agreement. On Friday, the Israeli defense minister said the line would be physically marked and warned that any trespassers would be targeted.",
      "The United States is also concerned about reports of Hamas attacking Palestinian civilians, a senior U.S. adviser said this week. The U.S. is working with Israel to create safe zones behind the yellow line for people who feel threatened, the adviser said.",
      "On Saturday, the U.S. Department of State said in a post on social media that there have been \u201ccredible reports indicating an imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,\u201d it said.",
      "More information was not immediately available. The State Department indicated in its statement that efforts would be made to ensure the ceasefire holds \u201cshould Hamas proceed with this attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States and the other guarantors remain resolute in our commitment to ensuring the safety of civilians, maintaining calm on the ground, and advancing peace and prosperity for the people of Gaza and the region as a whole,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Keeping up with food demand",
      "Two years of war and Israeli restrictions on aid have pushed the population of Gaza to the brink of starvation, with the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declaring a famine in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. Israel allowed very few aid trucks in, and aid began to pile up outside the crossings.",
      "As of Thursday, Israel had allowed some 950 trucks into Gaza, according to figures Israel supplied to mediators, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, told reporters Friday.",
      "The WFP also said it was trying to ramp up food production capacity inside Gaza. Over the past two weeks, nine bakeries in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis have produced a daily average of over 100,000 bread bundles.",
      "However, it said, \u201cThe quantity of nutritious food aid entering Gaza is still insufficient to address the severe hunger conditions.\u201d",

      "In the wake of Israeli troops\u2019 initial withdrawal from parts of Gaza, Hamas, which has ruled over the enclave since 2007, has tried to regain control, with the militant group\u2019s internal security organization issuing a call urging residents to report \u201cwanted individuals,\u201d including \u201ccollaborators\u201d with Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had confirmed earlier this year that Israel had \"activated\" clans that oppose Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States.

      "A prominent doctor who had become a voice for besieged Palestinians in Gaza and was detained by Israeli forces in December has had his detention without charge extended, his family and legal representatives said Thursday.",
      "The family and supporters of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, the head of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, had hoped he would be released under a ceasefire deal, along with dozens of medical workers who had been detained during Israel\u2019s offensive in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "According to an X post by Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, a legal group based in Gaza, an Israeli court \u201crubberstamped\u201d the extension of Abu Safiya\u2019s detention for another six months in a closed-door hearing.",
      "In a separate statement on Abu Safiya\u2019s own account, his family also said his administrative detention had been extended. Israel has not commented on the case.",
      "\u201cThere has been one shock after another, and the size of the pain is indescribable,\u201d Abu Safiya\u2019s son Elias Abu Safiya told NBC News  over WhatsApp on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can sleep while my father is worried, how I can eat while my father is hungry, and how I can live my normal life.\u201d",
      "Abu Safiya\u2019s family and supporters had hoped and expected he would be among the around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees Israel agreed to exchange for 48 hostages held by Hamas on Monday as part of a ceasefire deal.",
      "The Israeli military initially denied Abu Safiya was in its custody, but in a statement in January, it said without providing evidence he had been involved in \u201cterrorist activities\u201d and held \u201ca rank\u201d in Hamas that made Kamal Adwan Hospital a stronghold during the war.",
      "Abu Safiya\u2019s son and colleagues, including the Chicago-based nonprofit MedGlobal, which has partnered with local care workers in Gaza for years and arranges volunteer medical missions to the enclave, have rejected these allegations. Abu Safiya was the lead physician in Gaza for MedGlobal before his detention.",
      "Prior to his detention in December 2024, Abu Safiya had warned that Israeli strikes were putting patients, medics and sheltering civilians at risk, calling for the world to intervene to \u201cprotect the health care system.\u201d He refused to leave the side of his patients, even as tanks and bulldozers encircled his hospital.",
      "Abu Safiya was last seen in Gaza in December walking from Kamal Adwan Hospital toward Israeli tanks. Video verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, a lone figure in a white doctor\u2019s coat, moving through a rubble-strewn street surrounded by bombed-out buildings. The footage was believed to capture the moments before he was detained by Israeli soldiers.",
      "After detention orders in Abu Safiya\u2019s case were previously upheld by an Israeli court in March, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights maintained his innocence, saying in a news release that he was \u201csolely performing medical and administration duties at Kamal Adwan Hospital.\u201d",
      "Al Mezan says Abu Safiya reported enduring torture and inhumane living conditions to a lawyer who was previously able to visit him at Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli Prison Service told NBC News it does not provide details regarding the \u201cidentity, conditions, or legal status of prisoners and detainees.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has responded to those allegations by saying it acts in accordance with both the country\u2019s and international law and \u201cprotects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the case, the Israeli military referred NBC News to the Israeli Ministry of Justice. In a statement, the ministry said it was not responsible for determining the identity of those who are released.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, had alleged that disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein trafficked her to his powerful friends, including Andrew, against whom she filed a lawsuit in 2021 alleging that he sexually abused her when she was 17.",
      "British newspaper the Mail on Sunday reported that Andrew asked his police protection officer to investigate Giuffre before a photo was published in February 2011, showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre. The newspaper cited an email reportedly containing a request from Andrew, not seen by NBC News.",
      "Britain\u2019s Sunday Telegraph also claimed that Andrew \u201csought to dig up dirt\u201d on Giuffre.",
      "A spokesperson for London's Metropolitan Police said: \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied that the photo of him with Giuffre is real, and denies any wrongdoing connected with Epstein. He has not commented on the newspaper reports and did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",

      "The reports came two days after Andrew announced he would stop using his royal titles, including the Duke of York, after facing fresh questions over his friendship with Epstein.",
      "The decision was taken \u201cin discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family,\u201d he said in a statement, after concluding that \u201cthe continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family.\u201d",

      "Covid vaccines may come with a tantalizing benefit that has nothing to do with the virus they\u2019re designed to protect against: boosting the immune system to better fight tumors during cancer treatment.",
      "That\u2019s according to new results presented Sunday in Berlin at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference. The research is still in the earlier stages \u2014 it has yet to be tested in a Phase 3 clinical trial \u2014 but experts say it shows promise.",
      "\u201cI am cautiously optimistic,\u201d said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was not involved with the work. \u201cThere is a scientific logic to why this could work.\u201d",
      "Researchers found that among cancer patients getting immunotherapy, those who got an mRNA Covid vaccine within 100 days before starting their treatment lived longer.",
      "Only about 20% of cancer patients who get immunotherapy \u2014 which harnesses a person\u2019s immune system to fight cancer cells \u2014 respond to the treatment. Finding a way to boost the effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs has been a feat researchers have been exploring for years, with little success.",
      "Typically, the immune-stimulating tactics employed in the past have either done too little to activate the immune system or done too much, triggering an overactive response that can damage the body. There\u2019s a chance that mRNA Covid vaccines could exist in a Goldilocks zone.",
      "\u201cMaybe we just needed something that was medium-strong, and this could potentially be it,\u201d said Dougan, who emphasized the need for more research.",
      "That research will soon be underway: Dr. Adam Grippin, a senior resident in radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center who co-led the study, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results.",
      "In the research presented Sunday, Grippin and his co-authors looked back at survival rates among more than 1,000 people who had advanced non-small cell lung cancer and got immunotherapy as part of their treatment from 2019 through 2023. Of those, 180 people received an mRNA Covid vaccine within 100 days of starting treatment.",
      "The median survival for the group \u2014 when exactly half of those who underwent treatment are still alive \u2014 was nearly twice as long for those who were vaccinated compared to those who were not: about three years compared to just over 1.5 years.",
      "The researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients getting immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Forty-three got an mRNA Covid vaccine; 167 did not. For those who didn\u2019t get vaccinated, median survival was just over two years. Those who were vaccinated prior to treatment hadn\u2019t yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up.",
      "In further experiments in mice, the researchers got an answer they believe matches the way the vaccines work in humans.",
      "\u201cIt superdrives the immune system against tumors,\u201d Grippin said.",
      "Creating a beacon",
      "Vaccines that use mRNA are already a promising area of cancer research. Scientists have developed personalized mRNA cancer vaccines that are tailored to fight a person\u2019s unique tumor, as well as ones that target genes that are commonly found in certain types of cancer, including pancreatic. (These developments come as the Trump administration has canceled half a billion dollars in funding for mRNA vaccine research for infectious diseases.)",
      "If Grippin\u2019s later trial confirms the results of the early research, it could represent the next frontier for research on mRNA vaccines and cancer.",
      "Immunotherapy drugs work by boosting the immune system\u2019s ability to fight cancer, often by enhancing the power of immune cells called T cells, which attack invaders, or by making tumors easier for T cells to find.",
      "The mouse portion of the new research found that Covid mRNA vaccination appeared to make the immune system more attuned to recognizing tumors as a threat by stimulating dendritic cells, a type of white blood cell. When dendritic cells detect a threat, they turn on a sort of beacon that leads T cells to the perceived invader so they can attack. However, not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of fighting tumors, which is why scientists believe immunotherapies only work in some of the cancer patients who take them. In these people, the immune system recognizes cancer cells as a threat, but their specific T cells are unable to stop the tumors from growing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just random chance whether you have those cells or you don\u2019t,\u201d said Jeff Coller, a professor of RNA biology and therapeutics at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "Getting an mRNA Covid vaccine doesn\u2019t change whether a person has the specific T cells needed to fight their tumors, but it does appear to make it more likely that dendritic cells will detect a tumor as a problem and direct the T cells a person does have to the tumor. If those cells happen to be programmed to be able to kill tumor cells, having an mRNA vaccine that lights up the target before a person starts an immunotherapy can give their immune system a boost that helps the cancer therapy work better.",
      "Coller said one reason mRNA technology may be the best tool to elicit this response is because every cell in the body already contains mRNA.",
      "\u201cWe are really tapping into that natural process that your body already knows how to respond to,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are using your body\u2019s natural system to fight tumors.\u201d",
      "Dougan said it\u2019s possible that other factors could have accounted for better survival among people who were vaccinated prior to immunotherapy treatment. For example, a Covid infection may have weakened an unvaccinated person\u2019s body and hindered their ability to fight off cancer cells. In the past, early studies like this one have shown promising results that didn\u2019t pan out in later trials.",
      "\u201cWe have been misled by retrospective studies before,\u201d she said.",
      "Grippin agreed the findings warrant a closer look.",
      "\u201cThis data is exciting, but all of these findings need to be validated in Phase 3 clinical trials to determine whether these vaccines should be used in our patients,\u201d he said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 For years, pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong have been steadfastly in support of the government. That is, until the issue of same-sex partnerships came up.",
      "Last month, Hong Kong\u2019s opposition-free Legislative Council overwhelmingly voted down a government-sponsored bill that would have partially recognized same-sex unions in the Chinese territory.",
      "The rejection, which LGBTQ rights advocates said was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d has rekindled discussions about gay rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong as its leaders grow more in sync with the central Chinese government.",
      "The bill, which would have granted limited rights to same-sex couples, was a response to a 2023 order by Hong Kong\u2019s top court that gave the government until Oct. 27, 2025, to establish an alternative framework for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships, such as registered civil partnerships or civil unions.",
      "Marriage equality remains a work in progress in Asia, with only three jurisdictions \u2014 Taiwan, Nepal and Thailand \u2014 having fully legalized same-sex marriage. A 2023 survey of Hong Kong residents by the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that same-sex marriage was supported by about 60% of respondents.",
      "Though the Hong Kong legislation fell far short of fully recognizing same-sex marriage, equality campaigners said it still would have been a step forward for the international financial hub, whose global image has suffered greatly after mass anti-government protests, severe pandemic restrictions and a crackdown on dissent.",
      "However, 71 out of 86 lawmakers opposed the bill, with some blasting it as an attack on marriage and traditional Chinese values.",
      "The veto marked the legislature\u2019s first big split with the government since Beijing\u2019s \u201cpatriots-only\u201d electoral reform in 2021, which aimed to ensure \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d legislative support for the executive after the 2019 protests. The changes have essentially shut out the pro-democracy lawmakers who traditionally challenged the government.",
      "The Hong Kong government said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the veto but that it would respect the legislature\u2019s decision and turn to administrative means to protect the rights of gay couples. The details of its next steps are not immediately clear.",
      "\u2018No enthusiasm\u2019",
      "Hong Kong, a city of 7.5 million people, had been making some progress on LGBTQ rights through a string of court victories.",
      "In 2023, Hong Kong\u2019s top court ruled that transgender people could change their gender on their official identity cards without undergoing full sex reassignment surgery. In July, a Hong Kong court ruled that transgender people have the right to use public toilets in line with their affirmed genders.",
      "And last month, a Hong Kong judge ruled in favor of a lesbian couple who wanted to include both mothers\u2019 names on their son\u2019s birth certificate.",
      "But there have also been setbacks as the space for activism in Hong Kong has diminished. Pink Dot, the city\u2019s largest LGBTQ event, said last month that it was holding its 2025 edition online after losing its usual venue with no explanation.",
      "The case that prompted the same-sex marriage legislation was brought in 2018 by Jimmy Sham, a leading local gay rights activist who took the government to the Court of Final Appeal to have his overseas same-sex marriage recognized.",
      "The 2023 court ruling in his favor came while Sham, 38, one of 47 pro-democracy figures arrested in 2021 under a Beijing-imposed national security law, was on trial on subversion charges. Sham, who like most of the defendants pleaded guilty, was released from prison in May after serving more than four years.",
      "To comply with the landmark ruling, the Hong Kong government proposed a mechanism in July by which gay couples could visit their partners in the hospital, access their medical records and make decisions about organ donation and funeral arrangements. It did not address parental or adoption rights.",
      "The protections also would have applied only to same-sex couples who had registered their partnerships outside Hong Kong, a provision that advocacy groups criticized as discriminatory.",
      "Yet the proposal met with strong objections from lawmakers, who cited a \u201clack of social consensus\u201d in Hong Kong on the \u201chighly controversial\u201d subject of same-sex partnership.",
      "They argued that the bill, even though it did not legalize gay marriage, would still lead to a \u201ccollapse of traditional family ethics and values\u201d if passed.",
      "\u201cWhy stir up trouble and break tradition for a small group, throwing the whole society into turmoil?\u201d said lawmaker Junius Ho, a vocal opponent of LGBTQ rights.",
      "Sham said that although the veto was a \u201cgreat pity,\u201d he hoped authorities would relaunch the legislative process.",
      "\u201cThe question is whether those in power have the courage and wisdom to resolve differences and seek consensus,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Hong Kong officials said the government had made its \u201cbest effort\u201d to secure support from the legislature, basing the proposal on what they deemed \u201csocietal common ground.\u201d",
      "However, John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in the city\u2019s politics and governance, said he saw \u201cno enthusiasm\u201d from the government to create an alternative framework for recognizing same-sex partnerships.",
      "After being forced into action by the court, Burns said, the Hong Kong government \u201cwaited until virtually the last possible moment\u201d before proposing a \u201cminimalist bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had many opportunities to fix this, and they sat on their hands and looked at the sky,\u201d he added.",
      "What\u2019s next",
      "The Chinese central government and pro-Beijing lawmakers, who have denied any erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong, said the veto would not create a constitutional crisis but rather showcased the checks and balances of Hong Kong\u2019s governance.",
      "But legal experts said the government still has to find a way to comply with the court order.",
      "\u201cThe legislature rushed through this decision,\u201d said Azan Marwah, a Hong Kong barrister specializing in public law and family litigation.",
      "He said lawmakers should have proposed and debated amendments to the bill if they had concerns.",
      "\u201cBut instead of doing that, they simply abdicated their responsibility,\u201d Marwah said. \u201cNow, what will the court do? To be really frank with you, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, which proposed the failed legislation, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The lack of legal protections for same-sex couples may lead to a \u201cbig loss\u201d of local or foreign talent in Hong Kong, as many multinational companies value diversity and equality, said Marie Pang, deputy secretary-general of the centrist political party Third Side.",
      "\u201cIt would directly undermine Hong Kong\u2019s competitiveness as an international city, especially when other regions in Asia already have relevant systems in place,\u201d Pang said.",
      "Amid the uncertainty, many people in Hong Kong\u2019s LGBTQ community are continuing to look forward.",
      "The campaign for equality and inclusion is more than legal victories, said Louis Ng, a law student and gay rights advocate.",
      "\u201cReal change requires open communication and engagement with all sides. Only then may we persuade the strong opponents,\u201d Ng said. \u201cIt all takes time and effort.\u201d"

      "After a string of recent aircraft incursions along NATO\u2019s eastern flank and suspicious drones shutting down airports in several European countries including Germany, Denmark and Norway, fears about Russian aggression are growing in Latvia and its fellow Baltic nations, Estonia and Lithuania, already spooked by Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWe are on the front line. We are the eastern flank countries. We are neighboring Russia, an aggressive country,\u201d Andris Spr\u016bds, Latvia\u2019s defense minister, told NBC News earlier this month at the Riga Conference, a meeting of international political and military leaders.",

      "In Riga, officials have demolished the 260-foot victory memorial dedicated to the Soviet army and renamed the road where the Russian Embassy is located to Ukrainian Independence Street.",
      "The blue street sign sits at the corner building next to the embassy\u2019s CCTV cameras and under its large flag. Dozens of Ukrainian flags fly in the square just across the road.",
      "Linda Ozola, who served as Riga\u2019s deputy mayor for five years until this summer, oversaw the rebuilding of the shelter network, among other civil protection measures. She said her staff had to scout museums and archives for old documents, as well as reinspect old shelter spaces, some of which had fallen into disrepair.",

      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he expects to meet next week with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Malaysia to try to forestall an escalation of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that President Donald Trump said was unsustainable.",
      "Bessent made the announcement during a White House cabinet meeting and later confirmed plans for a meeting after a call with He on Friday evening. Bessent said on X the two officials \"engaged in frank and detailed discussions regarding trade between the United States and China.\"",
      "\"We will meet in-person next week to continue our discussions,\" Bessent wrote.",
      "China state news agency Xinhua reported that He and Bessent had \"candid, in-depth, and constructive discussions on major issues in bilateral economic and trade relations\" in a video call, and agreed to a new round of trade talks as soon as possible.",
      "The two officials previously met in four European cities over six months to hammer out a tariff truce that brought duties down from triple-digit levels for each country. That agreement expires on November 10.",
      "A meeting in Malaysia would shift the venue to a Southeast Asian exporter that trades heavily with both China and the U.S. and whose goods are now subject to a 19% duty imposed by Trump. Malaysia also faces a threatened 100% U.S. tariff on its semiconductors and derivative electronics devices under a national security trade review.",
      "Trump earlier on Friday blamed Beijing for the latest impasse, a dispute over China's sweeping new export restrictions on rare-earth minerals and magnets. He has threatened an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on November 1 unless Beijing scraps the restrictions.",
      "Asked whether such a high tariff was sustainable and what that might do to the U.S. economy, Trump replied: \"It's not sustainable, but that's what the number is.\"",
      "\"They forced me to do that,\" he said in an interview with Fox Business Network that was broadcast on Friday.",
      "Trump also has threatened to impose new U.S. export controls that would halt supplies of \"any and all critical software.\"",
      "The new trade actions were Trump's reaction to China dramatically expanding its export controls on rare-earth elements. China dominates the market for such elements, which are essential to tech manufacturing.",
      "Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday blasted the restrictions as a threat to global supply chains.",
      "Trump also confirmed he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in two weeks in South Korea and expressed admiration for the Chinese leader.",
      "\"I think we're going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal. It's got to be fair,\" Trump said on FBN's \"Mornings with Maria,\" which was taped on Thursday.",
      "Later, as he was preparing to have lunch at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss efforts to end its war with Russia, Trump said: \"China wants to talk, and we like talking to China.\"",
      "The softening in tone and affirmation of his intent to meet with Xi helped stem Wall Street's early losses on Friday. Major U.S. stock indexes, which have been rattled over the last week by Trump's abrupt re-imposition of steep levies on Chinese imports and by credit worries among regional banks, were up in afternoon trading.",
      "The head of the World Trade Organization urged the U.S. and China to de-escalate trade tensions, warning that a decoupling by the world's two largest economies could reduce global economic output by 7% over the longer term.",
      "WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters in an interview the global trade body was extremely concerned about the latest spike in U.S.-China trade tensions and had spoken with officials from both countries to encourage more dialogue.",
      "But tensions continued to run high, even as Trump and Xi prepared to meet.",
      "Bessent took aim at China's state-driven economic practices in a statement to the IMF's steering committee on Friday, urging the IMF and World Bank to take a tougher stance on China's external and internal imbalances and industrial policies that U.S. officials say have helped China build up excess manufacturing capacity that is flooding the world with cheap goods.",
      "And China's Commerce Ministry on Friday accused the U.S. of undermining the rules-based multilateral trading system since the Trump administration took office in 2025, vowing to intensify its use of dispute settlement actions at the WTO.",
      "It also urged the U.S. to roll back measures that breach non-discrimination rules and align its industrial and security policies with WTO obligations.",
      "Bessent earlier in the week had accused one of He's top aides of being \"unhinged\" in recent interactions with U.S. trade negotiators. China said on Friday that Bessent's remarks \"seriously distort the facts.\""

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that Budapest could host a second summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine was celebrated by Hungary\u2019s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n on Friday.",
      "\u201cBudapest is essentially the only place in Europe today where such a meeting could be held, primarily because Hungary is almost the only pro-peace country,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told state radio, according to The Associated Press. \u201cFor three years, we have been the only country that has consistently, openly, loudly and actively advocated for peace.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who has maintained his far-right populist rule for 15 years, also suggested that his opposition to Western nations supplying military and financial aid to Ukraine had played a role in his capital being selected as the site for the talks.",
      "While details of the agenda are yet to be finalized, in an earlier post on X, Orb\u00e1n said preparations were underway and his landlocked country was \u201can island of PEACE.\u201d",
      "Trump announced his second meeting this year with Putin on Thursday, the day before he was set to sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.",
      "\u201cI believe great progress was made with today\u2019s telephone conversation,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social after his call with the Russian leader, adding that he hoped the Budapest summit would end the \u201cinglorious war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who is expected to push for more military support, including long-range Tomahawk missiles that could be used to strike deep inside Russia, said the talks showed Putin was on the defensive. \u201cWe can already see that Moscow is rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X shortly after the summit was announced.",
      "Trump and Putin met in Alaska for a highly anticipated summit on ending the war in August. But their three-hour meeting did not result in any movement toward peace, and Russia has continued to bombard cities across Ukraine on an almost nightly basis since then.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal for three-way talks with Putin and Zelenskyy also failed to materialize.",
      "The Budapest summit is expected to take place after talks next week between teams led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.",
      "For Orb\u00e1n who is facing pressure at home over high food prices, health care and a poorly performing economy, \u201cit is an interesting distraction from those things,\u201d according to Emily Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Hungary \u201cis a country that doesn\u2019t normally have such a level of international clout, so, for Orb\u00e1n, this is a bit of an outsized role he is playing in foreign policy here,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday.",
      "\u201cThere aren\u2019t a huge amount of places where Putin could comfortably meet Trump in Europe,\u201d Ferris said, pointing to the fact that the Russian leader faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for the \u201cwar crime\u201d of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia \u2014 an allegation denied by Moscow.",
      "Hungary is a signatory to the ICC, which is based in the Netherlands, meaning that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government would be required to arrest Putin if he set foot on Hungarian soil. After a visit in April by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also faces a warrant from the ICC on suspicion of crimes against humanity, Orb\u00e1n said he would start the process of withdrawing from the court.",
      "Hungary\u2019s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a press briefing Friday that his country would receive Putin \u201cwith respect, host him, and provide the conditions for him to negotiate with the American president.\u201d",
      "However, Ferris cautioned that the summit could backfire on Orb\u00e1n, who is widely considered to be Putin\u2019s closest partner in the European Union and who has already been criticized for continuing to purchase oil and natural gas from Russia.",
      "Hungarian officials have insisted that geographical and infrastructural constraints make it nearly impossible for Hungary to transition to using fossil fuels supplied from the West. But earlier this month, Trump called on all NATO countries, including Hungary, to cease purchasing Russian oil, since he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if they did so.",
      "\u201cIf Hungary, if it\u2019s not already, is seen as just giving a platform for a Kremlin narrative on Ukraine, that could be quite damaging,\u201d Ferris said."
