    "story": [
      "The Grammys' country album category has been split into two for the 2026 award show",
      "NEW YORK -- Flashback to February. It's the 2025 Grammys, and Beyonc\u00e9 has made history. Not only was she finally awarded the top prize of album of the year, but she also became the first Black woman to win best country album, for \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d Recent changes by the Recording Academy have made it even more monumental: She might be the last person to ever win the award.",
      "In June, the Academy announced that the Grammys' country album title was splitting into two categories. A new award was created, traditional country album. The preexisting country album category has been redefined and is now contemporary country album, reflecting the genre's ongoing sonic evolutions.",
      "The decision was divisive: Some viewed it as backlash to Beyonc\u00e9's win. Others welcomed the addition of a new award and the creative doors it might open. Some questioned how the categories would be defined in a genre where the word \u201ctraditional\u201d is loaded.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the change \u2014 and what it could signify in the future.",
      "Charles L. Hughes, Rhodes College professor and author of \u201cCountry Soul,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9's victory was a welcomed surprise, despite being obviously worthy. That's because her album inspired a larger conversation about reclamation, standing in opposition to the music industry's rigid power structures and \u201cindicated how significant this historical question remains of whether or not Black folks have equal access to success in a genre of music that bears such strong Black influences and has from the very beginning,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "He believes the decision to alter the country album categories was not in direct response to her win \u2014 \u201cI think it is a more complicated story,\u201d he says \u2014 but the timing might've been less than ideal, emboldening fans to view it as reactionary. He hopes the changes will open the category to more diversity of sounds and \u201cwhether this leads to a broader opening and opportunity for Black artists, especially Black women in country music,\u201d he posits.",
      "Francesca T. Royster, a DePaul University professor and author of \u201cBlack Country Music: Listening for Revolutions,\u201d views Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s victory as positively connected to this change. She wonders if artists \u2014 particularly artists of color, who never had their music recognized in country music categories, think of artists like \u201cMillie Jackson or Candi Staton, Bobby Womack\u201d \u2014 would now see their work recognized. \u201cHaving these two categories just allows for more experimentation and maybe less of a double standard,\u201d she says, \u201cin terms of artists who are often held to higher standards to conform to, or be recognizable as, meeting an idea about what country music is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt makes sense that the Grammy categories for country would become a little bit more expansive,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think the music is more expansive and the audience is also more expansive than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "According to the Recording Academy's rule book, the traditional country category is defined by \u201ccountry recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation.\u201d",
      "Those are: acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar and live drums. This is also where subgenres like outlaw country, Western and Western swing would fit.",
      "The contemporary country category description is a bit more conceptual. The rule book states that albums eligible in this category \u201cutilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture.\u201d",
      "The hope is that those titles are \u201crelevant to the legacy of country music\u2019s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms.\u201d",
      "The questions Hughes poses: \u201cWhose tradition are we talking about?\u201d And how is \u201ccountry music's culture\u201d defined?",
      "\u201cIt's almost tautology. \u2018Well, it\u2019s traditional country if it sounds like traditional country,'\u201d he says.",
      "In that reading, contemporary country could simply account for everything else.",
      "Royster says both categories seem to \u201cspeak to an aesthetic as well as political agenda, many agendas.\u201d To her, the traditional category would appeal to artists who believe that \u201cthis is a past form that needs to ... continue to be recognized and respected.\u201d Similarly, the contemporary category is \u201clinked to the culture of country but is also expansive.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn both cases, there\u2019s a kind of story behind the story.\u201d",
      "Adding a new genre category is not unique to country music. Consider a sister genre, R&B. In 1999, the Recording Academy also introduced a traditional category to the R&B field to spotlight artists who chose to hybridize the genre as well as those who prefer nostalgic structures.",
      "It didn't stay stagnant from there: In 2021, the Academy changed the best urban contemporary album category to best progressive R&B album, to spotlight those records that weave R&B with other genres.",
      "In the contemporary country album category, Kelsea Ballerini's \u201cPatterns\u201d faces off against Tyler Childers' \u201cSnipe Hunter,\u201d Eric Church's \u201cEvangeline vs. the Machine,\u201d Jelly Roll's \u201cBeautifully Broken,\u201d and Miranda Lambert's \u201cPostcards from Texas.\u201d",
      "In the traditional category, it is Charley Crockett's \u201cDollar a Day,\u201d Lukas Nelson's \u201cAmerican Romance,\u201d Willie Nelson's \u201cOh What a Beautiful World,\u201d Margo Price's \u201cHard Headed Woman,\u201d and Zach Top's \u201cAin\u2019t In It For My Health.\u201d",
      "Royster wonders if with this first year of nominees, \u201cthere's less risk in terms of recognizing the kind of \u2018country-ness\u2019 of these artists.\u201d Royster views the lineup as \u201cartists (whose) country creds would still be recognized even if they\u2019re also bringing in other elements. I would hope in the future there might be more room in the category.\u201d",
      "For Hughes, the nominees further confuse the distinctions. Consider this example: Zach Top's album borrows heavily from George Strait's sound, which emerged in the \u201870s as a mesh of honky-tonk traditions and contemporary country. Hip-hop also emerged in the \u201970s. They were simultaneous. \u201cBut I have a feeling we won\u2019t be seeing a lot of hip-hop-inspired artists in the traditional category,\u201d he says.",
      "But that doesn't mean it might not evolve in the future. \u201cIf the Grammys fundamentally exist to give people recognition,\u201d he says, \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnytime the pipe widens, more water gets through. And this was the pipe widening, baby,\u201d Jelly Roll, who is nominated in the inaugural best contemporary country album category, told The Associated Press. \u201cI love it. I'm happy. I\u2019m a fan of both sides. It encourages me to maybe make a traditional country album one day, you know? So, this is cool.\u201d",
      "Three-time Grammy award winner Brad Paisley has a similar stance: There's a benefit to having more country music recognitions.",
      "\u201cAwards are really tools to sort of get awareness for something that you made, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re never the goal. It\u2019s always more like, \u2018Oh, cool, this might make more people listen to it.\u2019 \u2026 If this means they got to make more little gold gramophone statues to give out, and two people get them versus one, great.\u201d",
      "That said: Paisley's not sure which category he would fall into, or if the division could color an artist's creative decisions. \u201cI\u2019d almost have to think it through like, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re going for the Grammy on this. I better not do this on this record or something.\u2019 But hopefully that doesn\u2019t ever enter into it,\u201d he says.",
      "Hopefully, it's just a panel decided who belongs in which category, \u201cand then two people get to go home happy versus one. And that\u2019s good in my book,\u201d he said.",

      "But here\u2019s the thing: everybody may want to rule the world, but not everybody truly believes they CAN. This, one could argue, is what separates the true strivers from the rest of us.",
      "And Marty \u2014 played by Chalamet in a delicious synergy of actor, role and whatever fairy dust makes a performance feel both preordained and magically fresh \u2014 is a striver. With every fiber of his restless, wiry body. They should add him to the dictionary definition.",

Suddenly we\u2019re seeing footage of sperm traveling \u2014 talk about strivers! \u2014 up to an egg. Which morphs, of course, into a pingpong ball.",
      "This witty opening sequence won\u2019t be the only thing recalling \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d co-directed by Safdie with his brother Benny before the two split for solo projects. That film, which feels much like the precursor to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d began as a trip through the shiny innards of a rare opal, only to wind up inside Adam Sandler\u2019s colon, mid-colonoscopy.",
      "Sandler\u2019s Howard Ratner was a New York striver, too, but sadder, and more troubled. Marty is young, determined, brash \u2014 with an eye always to the future. He\u2019s a great salesman: \u201cI could sell shoes to an amputee,\u201d he boasts, crassly. But what he\u2019s plotting to unveil to the world has nothing to do with shoes. It\u2019s about table tennis.",

      "To Marty, perfectly likely. Still, he knows nobody in the U.S. cares about table tennis. He\u2019s so determined to prove everyone wrong, starting at the British Open in London, that when there\u2019s a snag obtaining cash for his trip, he brandishes a gun at a colleague to get it.",
      "Shaking off that sorta-armed robbery thing, Marty arrives in London, where he fast-talks his way into a suite at the Ritz. Here, he spies fellow guest Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow, in a wise, stylish return to the screen), a former movie star married to an insufferable tycoon (\u201cShark Tank\u201d personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, one of many nonactors here.)",
      "Kay\u2019s skeptical, but Marty finds a way to woo her. Really, all he has to say is: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d Once she sees him play, she\u2019s sneaking into his room in a lace corselet.",

The dizzying array makes one curious how it all came together \u2014 is casting director Jennifer Venditti taking interns? Production notes tell us that for one hustling scene at a bowling alley, young men were recruited from a sports trading-card convention.",
      "Elsewhere on the creative team, composer Daniel Lopatin succeeds in channelling both Marty\u2019s beating heart and the ricochet of pingpong balls in his propulsive score. The script by Safdie and cowriter Ronald Bronstein, loosely based on real-life table tennis hustler Marty Reisman, beats with its own, never-stopping pulse. The same breakneck aesthetic applies to camera work by Darius Khondji.",

      "Is there something else for Marty, besides his obsessive goal? If so, he doesn\u2019t know it yet. But the lyrics of another song used in the film are instructive here: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to learn sometime.\u201d",
      "So can a single-minded striver ultimately learn something new about his own life?",
      "We'll have to see. As Marty might say: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d an A24 release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor language throughout, sexual content, some violent content/bloody images and nudity.\u201d Running time: 149 minutes. Four stars out of four.",

      "It's the second best global debut of the year.",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d opened with $345 million in worldwide sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, notching the second-best global debut of the year and potentially putting James Cameron on course to set yet more blockbuster records.",
      "Sixteen years into the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, Pandora is still abundant in box-office riches. \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d the third film in Cameron\u2019s science-fiction franchise, launched with $88 million domestically and $257 million internationally. The only film to open bigger in 2025 was \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($497.2 million over three days). In the coming weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will have the significant benefit of the highly lucrative holiday moviegoing corridor.",
      "But there was a tad less fanfare to this \u201cAvatar\u201d film, coming three years after \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water.\u201d That film launched in 2022 with a massive $435 million globally and $134 million in North America. Domestically, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d fell a hefty 35% from the previous installment. Reviews for \u201cFire and Ash\u201d were also more mixed, scoring a series-low 68% \u201cfresh\u201d score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "Yet those quibbles are only a product of the lofty standards of \u201cAvatar.\u201d The first two films rank as two of the three biggest box-office films of all time. To reach those heights, the \u201cAvatar\u201d films have depended on legs more than huge openings.",
      "\u201cAvatar\u201d (2009), opened with $77 million domestically but held the top spot for seven weeks. It ultimately grossed $2.92 billion worldwide. \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d also held strong to eventually tally $2.3 billion globally.",
      "\u201cThe openings are not what the \u2018Avatar\u2019 movies are about,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do after they open that made them the no. 2 and no. 3 biggest films of all time.\u201d",
      "For \u201cFire and Ash\u201d to follow in those footsteps, it will need robust ticket sales to continue for weeks. Working in its favor so far: strong word-of-mouth. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "In interviews, Cameron has repeatedly said \u201cFire and Ash\u201d needs to perform well for there to be subsequent \u201cAvatar\u201d films. (Four and five are already written but not greenlit.) These are exceptionally expensive movies to make. With a production budget of at least $400 million, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is one of the costliest movies ever made.",
      "\u201cJames Cameron is not known for his low budget movies,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly create the world of Pandora on the cheap. If you\u2019re going to have a 3D movie, an epic film that\u2019s three hours and 17 minutes, it\u2019s a huge buy-in of money, time, resources, and then you have to hope the audience wants to once again go along on that ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d was especially boosted by premium format showings, which accounted for 66% of its opening weekend. A narrow majority of moviegoers (56%) chose to watch it in 3D.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have always been especially popular overseas. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d was strongest in China, where its $57.6 million opening weekend surpassed the two previous movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d didn\u2019t have the weekend entirely to itself. A trio of other new wide releases made it into theaters in hopes of offering some counterprogramming: Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cDavid\u201d and Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.\u201d",
      "In the race for second place, \u201cDavid\u201d came out on top. The animated tale of David and Goliath collected $22 million from 3,118 theaters, notching the best opening weekend for Angel Studios, the Christian-oriented studio that emerged with 2023\u2019s surprise hit \u201cSound of Freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Paul Feig\u2019s twisty psychological thriller starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, opened with $19 million 3,015 theaters. The Lionsgate release, which cost about $35 million to make, is set up well to be one of the top R-rated options in theaters over the holidays. Based on Freida McFadden\u2019s bestselling novel, it stars Sweeney as a woman with a troubled past who becomes a live-in maid for a wealthy family.",
      "Trailing the pack was \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,\u201d which collected $16 million from 3,557 theaters. The G-rated film, based on the Nickelodeon TV series, is the first \u201cSpongeBob\u201d theatrical movie since 2015\u2019s \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.\u201d",
      "All of this weekend\u2019s new films will hope the ticket sales keep rolling in over the upcoming Christmas break. Starting Dec. 25, they\u2019ll need to contend with some new wide releases, including A24\u2019s \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue,\u201d with Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson; and Sony\u2019s \u201cAnaconda,\u201d with Jack Black and Paul Rudd.",

But faith-based hits have been few and far between for most of this century.",
      "\u201cHollywood has taken a lot of criticism by those in the faith community for not providing films that speak to them, that reflect their values,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst, emphasizing the box-office potential of faith-based films.",
      "Studios are realizing faith-based film and television is a worthwhile investment at least in part due to the success of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d which Angel helped launch in 2017, even if it initially took time to see those results.",
      "\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get people to watch it,\u201d recalled Angel CEO and co-founder Neal Harmon. \u201cPeople have this idea that faith means cheesy or preachy. And we had to break through that barrier.\u201d",
      "Once they did, it paid off. Since Fathom Entertainment began distributing \u201cThe Chosen\u201d theatrically in 2023, the series has grossed more than $116 million domestically.",
      "Though not a Christian company, Angel aims to distribute and market \u201cvalues-based entertainment\u201d that includes but is not limited to stories of faith.

      "Tennessee Williams' early radio play, \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d is featured in The Strand this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Long before the rise of podcast dramas, listeners worldwide tuned in to the audio-only narratives of radio plays.",
      "Tom Stoppard and Arthur Miller were among the many playwrights who early in their careers completed brief pieces for radio, while such memorable dramas as Harold Pinter's \u201cA Slight Ache\u201d and Robert Bolt's \u201cA Man for All Seasons\u201d premiered as radio broadcasts. Radio work was often a way to bring in money and to refine the arts of plotting and dialogue.",
      "When Tennessee Williams was a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1930s, still referring to himself by his birth name, Tom Williams, he completed a rarely-heard gothic sketch for radio called \u201cThe Strangers.\u201d Williams' play appears this week in The Strand Magazine, which has previously published little-known works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck among others.",
      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",

      "The ongoing strike at the Louvre has become a major test of the museum's management",
      "PARIS -- The ongoing strike at the Louvre is no longer just a labor dispute. It has become a test of how securely, credibly and competently the world\u2019s most visited museum is being run.",
      "Behind the walkout are not only frayed labor relations, but a building itself under strain, with crumbling parts of the aging former palace now deemed unsafe.",
      "At the heart of the crisis lies a deeper rupture: a $102 million jewel heist that exposed security failures at the core of the institution and transformed long-simmering staff grievances into a national reckoning with global resonance.",
      "Tensions were already rising when a wildcat June strike abruptly shut the museum, stranding visitors beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. Weeks later, the Louvre announced the closure of offices and a public gallery because of weakened floor beams, deepening concern about neglect across the aging complex.",
      "The October daylight robbery, in which thieves stole crown jewels, intensified scrutiny from lawmakers and auditors and reframing workplace complaints as questions of institutional failure.",
      "Culture Ministry officials have tried to defuse the standoff by proposing to cancel a planned 2026 funding cut, hire additional guards and visitor services staff, and raise pay. Unions rejected the measures as inadequate, signaling that trust has frayed beyond quick fixes.",
      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",
      "French senators were told last week that thieves who stole crown jewels valued at more than $100 million escaped the Louvre with barely 30 seconds to spare, a detail that crystallized the scale of the breakdown.",
      "A parliamentary inquiry described the Oct. 19 theft as one of the result of cascading failures. Only one of two cameras covering the break-in point was functioning, and security staff lacked enough screens to monitor footage in real time.",
      "When the alarm finally sounded, police were initially sent to the wrong location, investigators said, a delay that proved decisive.",
      "\u201cGive or take 30 seconds, guards or police could have intercepted them,\u201d said No\u00ebl Corbin, who led the inquiry.",

      "For staff now on strike, the Senate findings confirmed what they say they had warned for years: that the museum\u2019s defenses were thin, its warnings unheeded, and its margin for error measured in seconds.",
      "The heist has sharpened attention on the Louvre\u2019s condition. Parts of the vast complex have been closed after officials discovered structural weaknesses, including nine rooms in the Campana Gallery devoted to ancient Greek ceramics. Technical reports cited \u201cparticular fragility\u201d in supporting beams, forcing staff relocations and closures until further notice.",
      "Unions say sections of the centuries-old building are in \u201cvery poor condition,\u201d pointing to incidents such as a November water leak that damaged hundreds of historic books as signs of broader neglect.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cNew Renaissance\u201d renovation plan, launched in early 2025 to modernize the Louvre and manage overcrowding, includes expanded entrances and major upgrades. Critics say it has moved too slowly and focused too heavily on headline projects. A court audit flagged considerable delays in deploying modern security equipment and found that only a fraction of allocated funds had been spent on safety.",
      "A proposal to give Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d a dedicated room with its own entrance was intended to ease crushing crowds. Instead, it has become a symbol of what workers see as misplaced priorities.",
      "Backed by Macron, the plan would separate the painting from the Salle des \u00c9tats to improve visitor flow. Supporters say it reflects the reality of mass tourism, with most visitors coming primarily to see the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d",
      "Unions counter that the project highlights a fixation on blockbuster attractions while staffing shortages, infrastructure decay and security gaps persist. They argue that money earmarked for redesign would be better spent on repairs, surveillance upgrades and front-line staffing. Some also fear the move could open the door to tiered access or higher prices.",
      "Former Louvre director Jean-Luc Martinez told senators this week that he believed the museum\u2019s security plan was sufficient, stopping short of accepting personal responsibility for failures exposed by the heist.",
      "Martinez, who led the Louvre from 2013 to 2021, said he was \u201cstruck, shaken and wounded\u201d by the robbery and insisted security had been a priority during his tenure. Lawmakers pressed him on why vulnerabilities identified in earlier audits, including a 2019 review of the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, were not addressed.",
      "He acknowledged delays to a broader 54-million-euro security overhaul, with contracts \u201csupposed to be launched in 2022.\u201d When told his successor later judged the plan incomplete, Martinez replied: \u201cI thought this plan was sufficient.\u201d",

      "Alex Warren's song \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025",
      "New York -- It jolted the winter, came alive in the spring, dominated the summer and went three-times platinum in the fall. Alex Warren's bombastic ballad \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025. It's also an unusual hit: slower than a traditional song of the summer, full of gloss, an ascendent hook and inoffensive, religious-adjacent lyricism.",
      "For those reasons, \u201cOrdinary\u201d has fast-tracked the 25-year-old singer/songwriter into mainstream musical fame, coming to a head in November when he earned his first Grammy nomination. The nomination for best new artist arrived just four months after the release of his debut album, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Alright, Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI bawled in my wife's arms,\u201d he said of the moment he found out about the nomination. For those who didn't believe in his music career, he says, \u201cthe biggest justification ever was the nomination.\u201d",
      "Most know Warren for \u201cOrdinary,\u201d but fame is not new for him. Before the chart-topping hit, Warren made a name for himself as a social media prankster in the TikTok collective \u201cHype House.\u201d And while that past might seem at odds with his new public persona, Warren always exuded perspicacity, the result of a troubled childhood that separated him from his comedic cohort. His father died of cancer when he was 9, he says, and his mother of complications due to alcoholism. A period of homelessness followed in his teens, before the TikTok fame.",
      "Still, he's remained curious and playful. At The Associated Press headquarters in New York, he chatted with staff and made disarming, self-deprecating comments. An example: In preparation to see the singer Shawn Mendes later, he dosed himself in cologne. \u201cI need to smell as good as Shawn Mendes looks,\u201d he joked.",
      "Social media success doesn't always yield a creative career \u2014 consider Warren and the innovative Addison Rae, a fellow best new artist nominee, exceptions to the rule \u2014 but it did prime him for the life he leads now. \u201cEverything that I went through back then definitely allowed me to do this,\u201d he says.",
      "Growing up online \u2014 and having \u201cdifferent versions\u201d of himself presented on social media \u2014 has \u201cdefinitely allowed me to now be unequivocally myself,\u201d he says.",
      "Warren wrote \u201cOrdinary\u201d a year ago at a writing camp. He says he knew there was something special about the track \u2014 though he and his collaborators were mostly alone in that feeling. \u201cA lot of people were like, \u2018Oh it\u2019s a ballad, it\u2019s a love song ballad. That\u2019s not a single, that\u2019s a song on the album. That\u2019s a feature, you should give it to someone else,\u2019\u201d he recalls. But he pushed it on TikTok, and soon, it connected.",
      "\u201cThe TikToks got it to do 4 million streams in a day, which was crazy,\u201d he said. Then he performed it on Netflix's \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d He played it with Ed Sheeran,Jelly Roll, Luke Combs and the Jonas Brothers. It built to ubiquity.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",
      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China\u2019s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",
      "Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.",

      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",

      "\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.\u201d",

      "Directed by Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d has been hailed by critics as one of the year\u2019s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendon\u00e7a Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).",
      "Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama.",
      "\u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d which won this year\u2019s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.",
      "In Brazil, expectations for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film \u2014 and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists \u2014 has made him \u201cincredibly happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo country develops without culture, without identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.\u201d",
      "Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d opens with a black-and-white montage of the era\u2019s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all consumed incredible things from so many places \u2014 from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cI am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it\u2019s good, it will be universal.\u201d",
      "Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother\u2019s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry \u2014 a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.",
      "One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director\u2019s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cThe Omen,\u201d shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.",
      "Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as \u201cMarighella,\u201d directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.",
      "Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil\u2019s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.",
      "\u201cThe military is a trauma that was never truly examined,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Move on, forget it.\u2019 A crust forms over it. The same thing happens to an entire nation.\u201d",

      "The character, who shelters political fugitives including Armando, stands out. When she walks toward the camera in a flowered dress, cigarette in hand, the film briefly belongs to her.",
      "\u201cHer authenticity carries something of many women I\u2019ve known,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cThere\u2019s something literary about her.\u201d",

      "\"This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,\u201d Hanaway said in the news release.",
      "At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. It called the lawsuit \u201c very absurd \u201d when it was filed in 2020.",
      "Last month, Missouri escalated its efforts to collect, asking the U.S. State Department to formally notify China that the state intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment.",

      "After Chinese officials didn\u2019t respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri\u2019s estimate of past and potential future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until it\u2019s collected.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, an ally of President Donald Trump who subsequently won election to the U.S. Senate, and alleged that Chinese officials were to blame for the pandemic. It was carried on by Attorney General Andrew Bailey, another Trump ally who resigned in September to become co-deputy director of the FBI.",
      "Hanaway, a former U.S. attorney and Missouri House speaker, inherited the case when she was appointed state attorney general by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe.",
      "The Associated Press wasn't immediately able to obtain its own copy of the Chinese-filed complaint. But a copy was linked to Hanaway's news release.",
      "The complaint accuses Missouri, as well as Schmitt and Bailey, of \u201cfabricating enormous disinformation, and spreading stigmatizing and discriminating slanders\u201d that have harmed China's reputation.",
      "Schmitt said he would wear the suit \u201clike a badge of honor\u201d and accused Chinese authorities of \u201cattempting to absolve themselves of all wrongdoing in the early days of the pandemic.\u201d",

      "A Michigan hospital is asking members of the public to raise their flashlights as well as the spirits of children during the holiday season",
      "ROYAL OAK, Mich. -- Volunteers gripping flashlights waved them high above their heads when the clock struck 8 p.m., shining beams through the frigid night sky \u2014 and into the hospital's windows.",
      "Exactly 10 minutes later, the enthusiastic crowd, still holding their flashlights aloft, in unison hollered \u201csweet dreams\u201d toward children in the hospital several stories above them.",
      "The nightly Moonbeams for Sweet Dreams tradition is again lighting up the night outside Corewell Health Children\u2019s hospital in Royal Oak in suburban Detroit.",
      "For 10 minutes each evening, volunteers standing outside the hospital shine flashlights toward the pediatric rooms above, delivering a message of hope and joy. The kids return the sentiment with their own lights, which they shine toward those below.",
      "\u201cTo be stuck in the hospital and feel like the world is moving on without you outside feels a little bit isolating, a little lonely, feels like maybe you\u2019ve been forgotten in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season,\u201d said Amanda Lefkof, a child life specialist at Corewell.",
      "Among the children in the hospital is 4-year-old Zoe Hostetter, who is undergoing chemotherapy treatments. On a recent night, she shone her own flashlight toward the bundled-up well-wishers below with her grandfather, Tim Schuele, by her side.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a big group of people that they don\u2019t know, but they see the love being sent by the lights,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re here kind of by themselves or with just close family and that\u2019s it for days.\u201d",
      "On these nights, though, the children are far from alone.",
      "Kevin Barringer was among those flashing lights toward the windows one night last week. Barringer's son, Connor, spent two months at the hospital in 2020 recovering from a spinal injury, and they were on the receiving end of the lights.",
      "\u201cIt gets pretty dark up there for the kids and for parents as well,\u201d Kevin Barringer said. \u201cHaving people down here letting them up there know that there are people with them and sending all their light up that way, it means a lot.\u201d",
      "Stephanie McMillan, sitting in a darkened room, held her 3-month daughter, Wren, in one arm and a flashlight in the other, shooting a beam in the direction of those gathered below.",

      "Anywhere from dozens to hundreds of people gather nightly, depending on the day of the week and the weather.",

In turn, the pediatric section of the hospital feels a bit like Las Vegas, where \u201cthe days and the nights kind of blend together.\u201d",

      "Severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of schools and youth training centers in camps for Rohingya in Bangladesh and crippled child protection pr...",
      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",
      "In a sweltering building not far from the cramped shelter where her husband tortures her, Hasina plays nervously with the strap of her pink mobile phone case, emblazoned with the words \u201cForever Young.\u201d",
      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet. Ever since 10-year-old Mohammed Arfan\u2019s school closed, this is where he spends 10 hours a day, seven days a week, selling snacks and daydreaming of the small schoolroom where he once felt safe and loved.",
      "He had just finished his math lessons the day that his teacher told him the school\u2019s funding was gone. As he walked home, he and his friends began to cry.",
      "\u201cI thought that I would not see my friends anymore, and that I was losing my future,\u201d he says.",
      "With no lessons to occupy his time, and his parents worried about their seven children\u2019s survival, Arfan\u2019s mother told him he would need to work to help keep the family fed.",
      "He was terrified. If the camp\u2019s kidnappers or thieves targeted him while he was working, he knew he was too small to fight back.",

Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",
      "There are boys like Arfan all over the camps, selling food they\u2019re desperate to eat and collecting trash in exchange for cash, shoulders slumped with exhaustion, skin seared by the sun.",
      "In a drainage ditch next to a row of stinking latrines, 13-year-old Rahamot Ullah wades up to his waist in water clouded with raw sewage, plucking from the muck discarded pieces of plastic. Five hours of rummaging through the waste will generally net him enough plastic to trade for around 50 taka (40 cents).",
      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",
      "Back on the street corner, Arfan, too, feels his dreams dying. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he says, voice barely audible above the incessant shrieking of horns from the rickshaws racing past, just inches from his cooler.",
      "\u201cI feel shame working,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the time I should be studying.\u201d",
      "Each night when the sun sets, Arfan packs up and heads back to his shelter. And it is here where he lies on a mat on the bamboo floor, crying himself to sleep and pining for the life he was forced to leave behind.",
      "The laughter that once filled Noor Zia\u2019s classroom has been replaced by tears. Nearly every day, she says, her former students stop by to see if the school has reopened, only to break down when told it has not.",
      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers. Shattered by the school closures, the 13- and 16-year-old girls believed traffickers who promised them a better life in Malaysia, Kaida says. Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",
      "The 13-year-old boy had been missing for nine days when the call came in from an unfamiliar number.",
      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "In an op-ed in the Albany Times Union, Hochul said she supports the proposal but has made an agreement with lawmakers to include \u201cguardrails\u201d in the measure before she signs it into law.",
      "Hochul, a Catholic, said she came to the decision after hearing from New Yorkers in the \u201cthroes of pain and suffering,\u201d as well as their children, while also considering opposition from \u201cindividuals of many faiths who believe that deliberately shortening one\u2019s life violates the sanctity of life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was taught that God is merciful and compassionate, and so must we be,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis includes permitting a merciful option to those facing the unimaginable and searching for comfort in their final months in this life.\u201d",
      "A dozen other states and the District of Columbia allow medically assisted suicide, according to advocates. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed legislation Friday that will allow terminally ill residents of that state to choose to end their lives.",
      "New York\u2019s Medical Aid in Dying Act requires that a terminally ill person who is expected to die within six month make a written request for life-ending drugs. Two witnesses would have to sign the request to ensure that the patient is not being coerced. The request would then have to be approved by the person\u2019s attending physician as well as a consulting physician.",
      "The governor said the bill's sponsors and legislative leaders have agreed to add provisions to require confirmation from a medical doctor that the person \u201ctruly had less than six months to live,\u201d along with confirmation from a psychologist or psychiatrist that the patient is capable of making the decision and is not under duress.",

      "She added that \u201cthis is a right afforded to New Yorkers only.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Hochul said the governor will sign the bill into law next year, with her changes weaved into the proposal.",
      "The legislation was first introduced in 2016 but stalled for years amid opposition from New York State Catholic Conference and other groups. The Catholic organization argued the measure would devalue human life and undermine the physician\u2019s role as a healer.",
      "In a statement after the governor's announcement, Cardinal Timothy Dolan and the New York's bishops said Hochul's position \u201csignals our government\u2019s abandonment of its most vulnerable citizens, telling people who are sick or disabled that suicide in their case is not only acceptable, but is encouraged by our elected leaders.\u201d",
      "New York lawmakers approved the legislation during their regulation session earlier this year. Supporters said it would reduce suffering for terminally ill people and let them die on their own terms.",

    "story": [
      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said that air pollution is still not taken seriously as a public health issue.",

      "Narayan said pollution causes long-term health problems for everyone exposed, but that it's especially bad for pregnant women, the elderly and children.",
      "\u201cAs a consequence of exposure to air pollution, we see a lot of preterm births, miscarriages, low birth weight. Exposure at this stage has a lifelong consequence,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier this month, New Delhi residents took to the streets to protest against dirty air and demand immediate government action in a relatively rare instance of public demonstrations.",
      "\u201cWe do not know whether ... citizens will be able to link air pollution to elections, but perhaps that\u2019s where India is moving toward,\u201d environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said in an interview. \u201cCitizens are fed up.\u201d",
      "Jha said authorities are not being honest about the problem and that there is a lack of political will to address the issue.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more headline and image management than pollution management,\u201d he said, adding that the high levels of pollution have been treated as normal by political leaders.",
      "\u201cThe first thing that the government needs to do is to be honest about the problem that we have,\" he said. \"The right diagnosis is extremely critical.\u201d",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Thailand and Cambodia will resume talks later this week to work toward a more durable ceasefire along their border, Thailand\u2019s foreign minister said Monday, stressing that progress depends on detailed bilateral negotiations rather than public declarations that internationalize the dispute.",
      "A ceasefire agreement in October was rushed to ensure it could be witnessed by U.S. President Donald Trump and lacked sufficient details to ensure the deal to end the armed conflict would hold, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Monday after an Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",
      "While Cambodia has publicy said it is ready for an unconditional ceasefire, Bangkok never received any direct proposal and Thailand believed such statements were aimed at increasing international pressure rather than resolving the issue, Sihasak said following the meeting that was arranged to seek ways to end the crisis.",
      "The general border committee involving both nations will meet Wednesday to iron out detailed measures toward a lasting ceasefire, he said.",
      "\u201cThis time, let's thrash out the details and make sure the ceasefire reflect the situation on the ground and the ceasefire is one that really holds, and both sides are going to fully respect the ceasefire,\u201d Sihasak told a news conference.",
      "The border conflict escalated into deadly combat two weeks ago and derailed the agreement promoted by Trump, which ended five days of fighting in July. The agreement was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through under pressure from Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. The ceasefire was formalized with more detail at an October regional summit in Malaysia attended by Trump.",
      "The fighting has drawn international concern. The U.S. Department of State on Sunday released a statement calling for Thailand and Cambodia to \u201cend hostilities, withdraw heavy weapons, cease emplacement of landmines, and fully implement the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords, which include mechanisms to accelerate humanitarian demining and address border issues.\u201d",
      "The fighting is a result of a dispute over patches of territory claimed by both nations along their shared border.",
      "The latest round of fighting began Dec. 8, a day after a border skirmish wounded two Thai soldiers. Since then combat has broken out on several fronts, with Thailand carrying out airstrikes in Cambodia with F-16 fighter jets and Cambodia firing thousands of medium-range BM-21 rockets from truck-mounted launchers that can launch up to 40 rockets simultaneously.",
      "More than three dozen people on both sides of the border have officially been reported killed in the past week of fighting, while more than half a million have been displaced, according to officials.",
      "Under the October truce Thailand was to to release 18 Cambodian soldiers held prisoner and both sides were to begin removing heavy weapons and land mines along the border. But the two countries have carried on a bitter propaganda war with minor cross-border violence.",

    "story": [
      "Dickson Ngome's farm at Lake Naivasha in Kenya's Rift Valley has been submerged due to rising water levels",
      "NAIVASHA, Kenya -- When Dickson Ngome first leased his farm at Lake Naivasha in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley in 2008, it was over 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from shore. The farm was on 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of fertile land where he grew vegetables to sell at local markets.",
      "At the time, the lake was receding and people were worried that it might dry up altogether. But since 2011, the shore has crept ever closer. The rains started early this year, in September, and didn't let up for months.",
      "One morning in late October, Ngome and his family woke up to find their home and farm inside the lake. The lake levels had risen overnight and about a foot of water covered everything.",
      "\u201cIt seemed as if the lake was far from our homes,\u201d Ngome\u2019s wife, Rose Wafula, told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then one night we were shocked to find our houses flooded. The water came from nowhere.\u201d",
      "The couple and their four children have had to leave home and are camping out on the first floor of an abandoned school nearby.",
      "Some 5,000 people were displaced by the rise in Lake Naivasha\u2019s levels this year. Some scientists attribute the higher levels to increased rains caused by climate change, although there may be other factors causing the lake\u2019s steady rise over the past decade.",
      "The lake is a tourism hot spot and surrounded by farms, mostly growing flowers, which have gradually been disappearing into the water as the lake levels rise.",
      "Rising levels have not been isolated to Naivasha: Kenya\u2019s Lake Baringo, Lake Nakuru and Lake Turkana \u2014 all in the Rift Valley \u2014 have been steadily rising for 15 years.",
      "\u201cThe lakes have risen almost beyond the highest level they have ever reached,\u201d said Simon Onywere, who teaches environmental planning at Kenyatta University in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi.",
      "A study in the Journal of Hydrology last year found that lake areas in East Africa increased by 71,822 square kilometers (27,730 square miles) between 2011 and 2023. That affects a lot of people: By 2021, more than 75,000 households had been displaced across the Rift Valley, according to a study commissioned that year by the Kenyan Environment Ministry and the United Nations Development Program.",
      "In Baringo, the submerged buildings that made headlines in 2020 and 2021 are still underwater.",
      "\u201cIn Lake Baringo, the water rose almost 14 meters,\u201d Onywere said. \u201cEverything went under, completely under. Buildings will never be seen again, like the Block Hotels of Lake Baringo.\u201d",
      "Lake Naivasha has risen steadily too, \u201cengulfing three quarters of some flower farms,\u201d Onywere said.",
      "Horticulture is a major economic sector in Kenya, generating just over a billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2024 and providing 40% of the volume of roses sold in the European Union, according to Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
      "Significant research has gone into the reasons behind the rising lakes phenomenon: A 2021 study on the rise of Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley lakes was coauthored by Kenyan meteorologist Richard Muita, who is now acting assistant director of the Kenya Meteorological Department.",
      "\u201cThere are researchers who come up with drivers that are geological, others with reasons like planetary factors,\u201d Muita said. \u201cThe Kenya Meteorological Department found that the water level rises are associated with rainfall patterns and temperature changes. When the rains are plentiful, it aligns with the increase in the levels of the Rift Valley lake waters.\u201d",

      "Naivasha\u2019s official high water mark was demarcated at 1,892.8 meters (6,210 feet) above sea level by the Riparian Association in 1906, and is still used by surveyors today. That means this year\u2019s flooding was still almost a meter (3 feet) below the high mark.",
      "It also means that the community of Kihoto on Lake Naivasha where the Ngomes lived lies on riparian land \u2014 land that falls below the high water mark, and can only be owned by the government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mess established by the government \u2026 towards the late 1960s,\u201d said Silas Wanjala, general manager of the Lake Naivasha Riparian Association, which was founded some 120 years ago and has been keeping meticulous records of the lake\u2019s water levels since.",
      "Back then, a farmer was given a \u201ctemporary agricultural lease\u201d on Kihoto, said Wanjala. When it later flooded and the farmer packed up and left, the farmworkers stayed on the land and later applied for subdivisions, which were approved. In the 60-odd years since, a whole settlement has grown on land that is officially not for lease or sale.",
      "This also isn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s been flooded, said Wanjala. It's just very rare that the water comes up this high. That\u2019s little consolation for the people who have been displaced by this year\u2019s floods and now cannot go home without risking confrontations with hippopotamuses.",
      "To support those people, the county is focusing its efforts on where the need is greatest.",
      "\u201cWe are tackling this as an emergency,\" says Joyce Ncece, chief officer for disaster management in Nakuru County, which oversees Lake Naivasha. \u201cThe county government has provided trucks to help families relocate. We have been helping to pay rent for those who lack the finances.\u201d",
      "Scientists like Onywere and Muita are hoping for longer-term solutions. \u201cCould we have predicted this so that we could have done better infrastructure in less risk-prone areas?\u201d Onywere said.",
      "Muita wants to see a more concerted global effort to combat climate change, as well as local, nature-based solutions centered on Indigenous knowledge, such as \u201cconservation agriculture, where there is very limited disturbance of the land,\u201d to reduce sedimentation of the lakes.",
      "But all of this is of little help to Ngome and Wafula, who are still living at the school with their children. As the rest of the world looks forward to the holidays and new year, their future is uncertain. Lake Naivasha\u2019s continuous rise over the past 15 years does not bode well: They have no idea when, or if, their farm will ever be back on dry land.",

      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",
      "The system is in active development and information about the timing of an expected deployment is too sensitive to share, according to an official familiar with the findings and other related intelligence that the AP did not see.

      "After such an attack, pellets and debris would over time fall back toward Earth, possibly damaging other orbiting systems on their way down, analysts say.",
      "Starlink's orbits are about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above the planet. China\u2019s Tiangong space station and the International Space Station operate at lower orbits, \u201cso both would face risks,\u201d according to Swope.",
      "The space chaos that such a weapon could cause might enable Moscow to threaten its adversaries without actually having to use it, Swope said.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV urged Vatican cardinals on Monday to put their ambitions of power and personal interests aside, as he followed in Pope Francis\u2019 footsteps and used a Christmas greeting to gently criticize his closest collaborators.",
      "\u201cIs it possible to be friends in the Roman Curia?\u201d Leo asked the cardinals and bishops who make up the Curia, as the Holy See bureaucracy is known. \u201cTo have relationships of genuine fraternal friendship?\u201d",
      "The fact that Leo asked the question suggests that the American pope knows well that the Curia remains a difficult and sometimes toxic workplace, one that Francis would often eviscerate in his annual Christmas addresses.",
      "Leo didn\u2019t repeat Francis\u2019 more biting critique \u2014 that Vatican clergy sometimes suffer from \u201cspiritual Alzheimers,\u201d the \u201ccancer\u201d of cliques, the \u201ccorruption\u201d of ambition and \u201cself-absorbed\u201d idle gossip \u2014 and his tone was far more gentle and constructive.",
      "But the underlying message remained. Leo, who was very close to Francis and worked in the Vatican for two years before his election, didn\u2019t shy away from Francis\u2019 tradition of using the Christmas occasion to urge Vatican bureaucrats to examine their consciences and change their ways for the good of the church.",
      "\u201cAt times this bitterness finds its way among us as well, when, after many years of service in the Curia, we observe with disappointment that certain dynamics \u2014 linked to the exercise of power, the desire to prevail, or the pursuit of personal interests \u2014 are slow to change,\u201d Leo said.",
      "\u201cAmid daily toil, it is a grace to find trustworthy friends, where masks fall away, no one is used or sidelined, genuine support is offered, and each person\u2019s worth and competence are respected, preventing resentment and dissatisfaction.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \u201cunacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they did not pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \u201ccriminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",

      "The 38-year-old Denver resident gets makeup ideas from TikTok videos and other social media content, not salespeople at beauty counters.

      "Nordstrom unwrapped the reimagined beauty floor of its midtown Manhattan store in September. It includes an area where shoppers can test beauty tools like LED light therapy masks and a \u201cfragrance finder\u201d machine that provide a dry whiff of up to 60 different scents.",
      "Nordstrom also expanded the beauty treatments area at the New York flagship and a few other stores to include a medical spa that provides Botox and dermal filler injections that cost $575 to $1,050.",
      "Sephora redefined beauty buying by installing mirrors and disposable application tools near compact displays of both tester products and ready-to-grab goods. The DIY concept was a major contrast from department store counters staffed by beauty advisers who oversaw product sampling and retrieved fresh products from locked drawers.",

      "The stations where customers get their hair and makeup done are getting moved to the side for more privacy. The chain, known for its long cash register lines, plans to expedite check-outs by equipping salespeople with devices that accept card and contactless payments.",
      "Ulta, which stocks drugstore beauty brands like Maybelline as well as high-end brands, has had in-store hair salons since its founding in 1990. It\u2019s adding ear piercing, testing robotic manicures and plans to add robotic lash extensions like Nordstrom\u2019s to its service menu next year.",
      "Walmart has moved into the turf of specialty retailers and department stores with products from higher-end and independent brands. The nation's largest retailer put beauty counters this year in 100 stores where customers can try products.",
      "After working at a fashion event at Nordstrom's Manhattan flagship, Ivan Leon, a 35-year-old freelance stylist, headed to the Tom Ford fragrance counter. He walked away an hour later having spent $537 on two bottles of perfume: a unisex scent named Bitter Peach and another named Vanilla Sex.",

      "December is a big month for fragrance sales in the U.S. Market research firm Circana says one-quarter of annual sales of high-end perfumes, colognes and other scented beauty products happen then",
      "NEW YORK -- December is a notable time for fragrance. The month accounts for one-quarter of the high-end perfumes, colognes, body mists and other scented beauty products sold annually in the United States, according to market research firm Circana.",
      "Fragrances of all kinds and prices also have taken off as a popular purchase, outperforming sales of makeup and skincare in the first nine months of the year, the firm said.",
      "However, many shoppers don't want to get spritzed while wandering through a department store and don't want a salesperson's help picking out a perfume for loved ones or themselves. They may know what they want from hearing about social media trends like \u201cfragrance layering.\u201d Some enthusiasts collect scents like they might handbags and trust their own noses.",
      "Macy\u2019s requires its 10,000 beauty advisers to do weekly training. It covers new information from brands and the latest trends, such as the reemergence of matte makeup and \"juicy fruit\" fragrances. The advisers also get selling tips and tricks.",
      "Shoppers \u201ccome in knowing what they\u2019ve seen on TikTok, but our beauty advisers really help them discover what is the perfect scent for them,\u201d said Nicolette Bosco, vice president and divisional merchandise manager of Macy's beauty business.",
      "To understand the changing retail environment for beauty products, I received a taste of sales training the week before Black Friday at the flagship Macy's in New York City that served as the setting for the 1947 Christmas movie \u201cA Miracle on 34th Street.\u201d",
      "Virginia Dervil, a business manager for Parfum Christian Dior, trains beauty advisers for the makeup and fragrance division of the Dior brand. She spent roughly 30 minutes explaining Dior's fragrance lineup and offering advice on how to approach shoppers. On a busy Friday, I tried to put her teaching to the test during another half-hour standing in front of a Dior counter.",
      "In that time, I enticed only three people to try out scents and didn't make a single sale. I found it difficult \u2014 and at times frustrating \u2014 to get the attention of passing shoppers. When customers did pause by the counter, most wanted to explore alone.",
      "Here are four things I learned:",
      "Always smile at shoppers as they walk by and try complimenting them on what they're wearing, Dervil said. If they moved on, I knew enough not to follow them. Remember the old sales adage about the importance of direct eye contact. It's more crucial than ever since many customers will be wearing earbuds or headphones and might not hear a spoken invitation to sample products.",
      "If customers stop by the counter, ask if they want help. If they say no, let them explore and don't be pushy. They often start asking questions if you let them linger a while, Dervil said.",

      "Ask shoppers what they are looking for once they indicate they want help, Dervil said. \u201cAre they looking for themselves or is it a gift for someone?\u201d is a standard approach, she said. Understanding what brought someone into the store is a way to better guide them in making a selection.",
      "Always direct customers first to the fragrance in the middle of the spectrum between subtle and strong. The midpoint is typically the most popular. In Dior's J'Adore line, the favorite version is the \u201ceau de parfum,\" Dervil said. If a customer think that's too strong or too light, direct them accordingly, she advised.",
      "I also learned that going up or down the spectrum doesn't always mean a more diffused or intense version of the same scent. It may lead to a different smell altogether.",
      "For example, the \u201cparfum d\u2019eau\u201d form of J'Adore smelled like a lighter version of the \u201ceau de parfum.\u201d But the line's lightest scent, J'Adore Eau Lumiere, had a citrusy scent that was totally different.",
      "Don't spray or dab on shoppers. Instead, spritz three times on a paper test strip and let it sit for a few seconds before the customer smells it, Dervil advised. Otherwise, the initial whiff may be too overwhelming, she said.",
      "Start asking open-ended questions about what they like or don't like about the scent. If they want to try other products, fold the strip and place it next to the just-sampled fragrance as a reminder of which one it was.",
      "If they're switching from scent to scent, ask them to sniff their arm or the back of their hand to clear their nostrils for the next one, Dervil said.",
      "If a customer likes a scent, discuss prices and bottle sizes, and hope to complete the sale.",

      "\u201cShe said my participation in the union election was problematic and she said she needed to discuss this with Wall Street Journal management in New York and also with legal,\u201d Cheng said, referring to in-house lawyers at Dow Jones.",

      "NEW YORK -- Consumers stepped up their spending, particularly on items like gadgets and clothing, for the first seven weeks of the holiday shopping period. But the pace was slower than a year ago amid worries about higher prices and other economic concerns, according to new data from Visa released Tuesday.",

      "The figure includes all methods of payment including cash and card.",
      "The data, which exclude sales from auto dealerships, gas stations, and restaurants, are not adjusted for inflation including the impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "When adjusted, retail sales rose a more modest 2.2% for that time frame, according to Visa's principal U.S. economist Michael Brown. That compares to the inflation-adjusted 3% sales gain last year.",
      "\u201cIt's certainly not a spectacular season,\u201d Brown told The Associated Press. \"It's sort of an average holiday season given concerns about macro economic growth, inflation. There's still a lot of uncertainty among the consumer population.\"",
      "Retailers have described shoppers as being selective when making holiday purchases, choosing to focus on gifts for under the tree instead of holiday decor like ornaments for the tree, for example. Many households are struggling with higher prices in groceries, rent and imported goods hit by tariffs. The latest job report, released by the Labor Department last week, also shows a souring employment picture.",

Last week, Polis also criticized the administration's plans to dismantle a federal climate research lab located in the state.",

      "U.S. regulators have approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy",
      "U.S. regulators on Monday gave the green light to a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval handed drugmaker Novo Nordisk an edge over rival Eli Lilly in the race to market an obesity pill. Lilly\u2019s oral drug, orforglipron, is still under review.",
      "Both pills are GLP-1 drugs that work like widely used injectables to mimic a natural hormone that controls appetite and feelings of fullness.",
      "In recent years, Novo Nordisk\u2019s injectable Wegovy and Lilly\u2019s Zepbound have revolutionized obesity treatment globally and in the U.S., where 100 million people have the chronic disease.",
      "The Wegovy pills are expected to be available within weeks, company officials said. Availability of oral pills to treat obesity could expand the booming market for obesity treatments by broadening access and reducing costs, experts said.",
      "About 1 in 8 Americans have used injectable GLP-1 drugs, according to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. But many more have trouble affording the costly shots.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an entire demographic that can benefit from the pills,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not just about who gets it across the finish line first. It\u2019s about having these options available to patients.\u201d",
      "The Novo Nordisk obesity pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide. That's the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic and in Rybelsus, a lower-dose pill approved to treat diabetes in 2019.",
      "In a clinical trial, participants who took oral Wegovy lost 13.6% of their total body weight on average over about 15 months, compared with a 2.2% loss if they took a placebo, or dummy pill. That\u2019s nearly the same as injectable Wegovy, with an average weight loss of about 15%.",
      "Chris Mertens, 35, a pediatric lung doctor in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, joined the Novo Nordisk trial in 2022 and lost about 40 pounds using the Wegovy pill. The daily medication worked to decrease his appetite and invasive thoughts of food, he said.",
      "\u201cIf there were days where I missed a meal, I almost didn\u2019t realize it,\u201d Mertens said.",
      "Participants in a clinical trial who took the highest dose of Lilly\u2019s orforglipron lost 11.2% of their total body weight on average over nearly 17 months, compared with a 2.1% loss in those who took a placebo.",
      "Both pills resulted in less weight loss than the average achieved with Lilly\u2019s Zepbound, or tirzepatide, which targets two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, and led to a 21% average weight loss.",
      "All the GLP-1 drugs, oral or injectable, have similar side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.",

      "Both daily pills promise convenience, but the Wegovy pill must be taken with a sip of water in the morning on an empty stomach, with a 30-minute break before eating or drinking.",
      "That\u2019s because Novo Nordisk had to design the pill in a way that prevented the drug from being broken down in the stomach before it could be absorbed by the bloodstream. The drugmaker added an ingredient that protects the medication for about 30 minutes in the gut and makes it easier to take effect.",
      "By contrast, Lilly\u2019s orforglipron has no dosing restrictions. That drug is being considered under the FDA\u2019s new priority voucher program aimed at cutting drug approval times. A decision is expected by spring.",
      "Producing pills is generally cheaper than making drugs delivered via injections, so the cost for the new oral medications could be lower. The Trump administration earlier this year said officials had worked with drugmakers to negotiate lower prices for the GLP-1 drugs, which can cost upwards of $1,000 a month.",
      "The company said the starting dose would be available for $149 per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be available in January.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether daily pills or weekly injections will be preferred by patients. Although some patients dislike needles, others don't seem to mind the weekly injections, obesity experts said. Mertens turned to injectable Zepbound when he regained weight after the end of the Wegovy pill clinical trial.",

      "This was a scary good year for investors",
      "NEW YORK -- It was a scary good year for investors.",
      "It was scary because the U.S. stock market plunged to several historic drops on worries about everything from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs to interest rates to a possible bubble in artificial-intelligence technology. In the end, though, it was a great year for anyone with the stomach to stick through the swings.",
      "S&P 500 index funds, which sit at the heart of many savers\u2019 401(k) accounts, returned more than 18% in 2025 through Dec. 11 and set a record high that day. It\u2019s their third straight year of big returns.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the surprises that shaped financial markets along the way:",
      "Trump dropped the biggest surprise on \u201cLiberation Day\u201d in April, when he announced a sweeping set of tariffs that were more severe than investors expected.",
      "It immediately triggered worries about a possible recession and spiking inflation. The S&P 500 plunged nearly 5% on April 3 for its worst day since the 2020 COVID crash. The very next day, it dropped 6% after China\u2019s response raised fears of a tit-for-tat trade war.",
      "The tariffs\u2019 impact went beyond the stock market. The value of the U.S. dollar fell, and fear even shook the U.S. Treasury market, which is seen as perhaps the safest in existence.",
      "Trump eventually put his tariffs on pause on April 9 after seeing the U.S. bond market get \u201cqueasy,\u201d as he put it, which sent relief through Wall Street. Since then, Trump has negotiated agreements with countries to lower his proposed tariff rates on their imports, helping calm investors\u2019 nerves.",
      "Wall Street motored higher through a remarkably calm summer thanks to euphoria around artificial-intelligence technology and strong profit reports from companies. The market also got a boost from three cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.",
      "Trade worries can still cause havoc in markets, and Trump sent stocks spiraling as recently as October with threats of higher tariffs on China.",
      "Another surprise was how hard, and how personally, Trump lobbied to get the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.",
      "The Fed has traditionally operated separately from the rest of Washington, making its decisions on interest rates without having to bend to political whims. Such independence, the thinking goes, gives it freedom to make unpopular moves that are necessary for the economy\u2019s long-term health.",
      "Keeping interest rates high, for example, could slow the economy and frustrate politicians looking to please voters. But it could also be the medicine needed to get high inflation under control.",
      "As inflation stubbornly remained above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the central bank kept rates steady through August. This drew Trump\u2019s ire \u2013 even though it was his own trade policies that were driving fears about inflation higher.",
      "Trump continuously picked on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, even giving him the nickname \u201cToo Late.\u201d Their tense relationship reached a head in July when Trump, in front of cameras, accused Powell of mismanaging the costs of a renovation of the Fed\u2019s headquarters. Powell, in turn, shook his head.",
      "Even though Wall Street loves lower rates, the personal attacks caused some queasiness in financial markets because of the possibility of a less independent Fed. Powell\u2019s turn as Fed chair is set to expire in May, and the wide expectation is that Trump will choose a replacement more likely to cut rates.",

For companies in the S&P 500, analysts are expecting earnings per share to rise 14.5% in 2026, according to FactSet. That would be an acceleration from the 12.1% growth estimated for 2025.",
      "But some of this year\u2019s concerns will linger. Chief among them is the worry that all the investment in artificial-intelligence technology may not produce enough profits and productivity to make it worth it. That could keep the pressure on AI stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom, which were responsible for so much of the market\u2019s gains this year.",
      "And it\u2019s not just AI stocks that critics say are too pricey. Stocks across the market still look expensive after their prices climbed faster than profits.",
      "That has strategists at Vanguard estimating U.S. stocks may return only about 3.5% to 5.5% in annualized returns over the next 10 years. Only twice in the last 10 years has the S&P 500 failed to meet that bar, assuming this year ends without another sell-off.",
      "At Bank of America, strategist Savita Subramanian says the S& P 500 could rise by less than half as much as profits do in 2026. She said that could be a result of companies reducing stock buybacks, as well as global central banks implementing fewer rate cuts.",

      "ROME -- Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder to get the Instagrammable selfie in front of one of the world\u2019s most celebrated waterworks.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro ($2.35) fee for tourists to get close to the fountain made famous by Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City\u2019s efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome\u2019s cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city 6.5 million euros ($7.6 million) extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome\u2019s Pantheon monument and the more complicated tourist day-tripper tax that the lagoon city of Venice imposed last year in a bid to ease overtourism and make the city more liveable for residents.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro (nearly $6) tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",
      "\u201cWe believe that culture is a fundamental right of citizenship,\u201d Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference. \u201cWe think it\u2019s correct and positive that the citizens of Rome can enjoy our museums free of charge.\u201d",
      "At the same time, he said, the 2-euro ($2.35) Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",

      "Crosby, Rust and Rakell embraced behind the net after the goal and the Penguins spilled over the bench to congratulate their captain. Later in the period, a 30-second video message recorded by Lemieux congratulating Crosby on the accomplishment was played.",
      "\u201cI knew when we played together in 2005 that you were going to be a very special player and accomplish a lot of great things in your career,\u201d Lemieux said in the message. \u201cHere we are 20 years later, you\u2019re now one of the best to ever play the game.\u201d",
      "A hush fell over the arena as fans intently listened to Lemieux\u2019s message.",
      "\u201cSeeing the crowd go quiet when Mario\u2019s message come on, that was pretty special,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t understand the impact he\u2019s had here and you were here tonight, I think you understand it a little bit better given how quiet it got.\u201d",
      "Lemieux, the Hall of Famer, who also owned the franchise following his second retirement, became the Penguins\u2019 all-time points leader, surpassing then-assistant coach Rick Kehoe on Jan. 20, 1989, when Crosby was 17 months old. Lemieux, who was in the lineup when Crosby recorded his first NHL point, finished his career with 1,723 points in 915 games.",

He was a big part of helping me out and a huge influence on me.\u201d",
      "Crosby, the No. 1 overall pick in 2005, is the seventh outright all-time points leader in 58 years of the franchise\u2019s history and the ninth active player to lead a franchise in points. Crosby previously broke Lemieux\u2019s record for most assists in franchise history last Dec. 29 against the New York Islanders. Crosby is 45 goals behind Lemieux\u2019s franchise record of 690.",
      "Crosby is now third on the NHL\u2019s all-time points list with a single franchise, behind only Steve Yzerman (1,755) and Gordie Howe (1,809), both with Detroit.",
      "Crosby also passed Phil Esposito (449) for sole possession of the ninth-most even-strength goals in NHL history. He also tied Adam Oates for the eighth-most assists in NHL history in the first period. Crosby, who has 20 goals this season, achieved his 18th 20-goal season. Only six players in NHL history have more.",

    "story": [
      "NATO-nation intelligence services believe Russia is developing a weapon to target Starlink satellites",
      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",
      "The system is in active development and information about the timing of an expected deployment is too sensitive to share, according to an official familiar with the findings and other related intelligence that the AP did not see. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the nonpublic findings.",

      "Such Russian research could be simply experimental, Samson said.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past some scientists ... to build out something like this because it\u2019s an interesting thought-experiment and they think, you know, \u2018Maybe at some point we can get our government to pay for it,'\" she said.",
      "Samson suggested the specter of a supposed new Russian threat may also be an effort to elicit an international response.",
      "\u201cOften times people pushing these ideas are doing it because they want the U.S. side to build something like that or ... to justify increased spending on counterspace capabilities or using it for a more hawkish approach on Russia,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that this is what\u2019s happening with this,\" Samson added. \u201cBut it has been known to happen that people take these crazy arguments and use them.\u201d",
      "The intelligence findings say the pellets would be so small \u2014 just millimeters across \u2014 that they would evade detection by ground- and space-based systems that scan for space objects, which could make it hard to pin blame for any attack on Moscow.",
      "Clayton Swope, who specializes in space security and weaponry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based security and policy think tank, said if \u201cthe pellets are not trackable, that complicates things\u201d but \u201cpeople would figure it out.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf satellites start winking out with damage, I guess you could put two and two together,\" he said.",
      "Exactly how much destruction tiny pellets could do isn't clear. In November, a suspected impact by a small piece of debris was sufficient to damage a Chinese spacecraft that was meant to bring three astronauts back to the Earth.",
      "\u201cMost damage would probably be done to the solar panels because they\u2019re probably the most fragile part\u201d of satellites, Swope said. \u201cThat\u2019d be enough, though, to damage a satellite and probably bring it offline.\u201d",
      "After such an attack, pellets and debris would over time fall back toward Earth, possibly damaging other orbiting systems on their way down, analysts say.",
      "Starlink's orbits are about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above the planet. China\u2019s Tiangong space station and the International Space Station operate at lower orbits, \u201cso both would face risks,\u201d according to Swope.",
      "The space chaos that such a weapon could cause might enable Moscow to threaten its adversaries without actually having to use it, Swope said.",
      "\u201cIt definitely feels like a weapon of fear, looking for some kind of deterrence or something,\u201d he said.",
      "Samson said the drawbacks of an indiscriminate pellet-weapon could steer Russia off such a path.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve invested a huge amount of time and money and human power into being, you know, a space power,\u201d she said.",
      "Using such a weapon \u201cwould effectively cut off space for them as well,\u201d Samson said. \u201dI don't know that they would be willing to give up that much.\"",

Two boys ultimately were charged, but not before one of the victims was expelled for starting a fight with a boy she accused of creating the images of her and her friends.",
      "\u201cWhile the ability to alter images has been available for decades, the rise of A.I. has made it easier for anyone to alter or create such images with little to no training or experience,\u201d Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre said in a news release. \u201cThis incident highlights a serious concern that all parents should address with their children.\u201d",
      "Here are key takeaways from AP's story on the rise of AI-generated nude images and how schools are responding.",
      "The prosecution stemming from the Louisiana middle school deepfakes is believed to be the first under the state\u2019s new law, said Republican state Sen. Patrick Connick, who authored the legislation.",
      "The law is one of many across the country taking aim at deepfakes. In 2025, at least half the states enacted legislation addressing the use of generative AI to create seemingly realistic, but fabricated, images and sounds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the laws address simulated child sexual abuse material.",
      "Students also have been prosecuted in Florida and Pennsylvania and expelled in places like California. One fifth grade teacher in Texas also was charged with using AI to create child pornography of his students.",
      "Deepfakes started as a way to humiliate political opponents and young starlets. Until the past few years, people needed some technical skills to make them realistic, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University who has written about the issue.",
      "\u201cNow, you can do it on an app, you can download it on social media, and you don\u2019t have to have any technical expertise whatsoever,\u201d he said.",
      "He described the scope of the problem as staggering. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said the number of AI-generated child sexual abuse images reported to its cyber tipline soared from 4,700 in 2023 to 440,000 in just the first six months of 2025.",
      "Sameer Hinduja, the co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, recommends that schools update their policies on AI-generated deepfakes and get better at explaining them. That way, he said, \u201cstudents don\u2019t think that the staff, the educators are completely oblivious, which might make them feel like they can act with impunity.\u201d",
      "He said many parents assume that schools are addressing the issue when they aren\u2019t.",

      "AI deepfakes are different from traditional bullying because instead of a nasty text or rumor, there is a video or image that often goes viral and then continues to resurface, creating a cycle of trauma, Alexander said.",

      "Parents can start the conversation by casually asking their kids if they\u2019ve seen any funny fake videos online, Alexander said.",
      "Take a moment to laugh at some of them, like Bigfoot chasing after hikers, he said. From there, parents can ask their kids, \u201cHave you thought about what it would be like if you were in this video, even the funny one?\u201d And then parents can ask if a classmate has made a fake video, even an innocuous one.",
      "\u201cBased on the numbers, I guarantee they\u2019ll say that they know someone,\u201d he said.",

      "The program was meant to help grocers and other retailers learn more about what kinds of prices customers would pay for items, similar to how stores offer different prices for the same products at different locations. But it raised alarms after a report from Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups, Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union, said Instacart offered nearly three out of every four grocery items to shoppers at multiple prices in an experiment.",
      "\u201cAt a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart,\u201d the company said in a Monday blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay \u2013 especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\u201d",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said, but \u201cfrom now on, Instacart will not support any item price testing services.\u201d",
      "Instacart said these services were neither \u201c dynamic pricing,\u201d a system where the price for something can go up when demand is high, nor \u201csurveillance pricing,\u201d where prices can be set based on a user's income, shopping history or other personal information.

      "Christian influencers are reaching hundreds of thousands of young people online",
      "ATLANTA -- Millennial and Generation Z Christian influencers are increasingly filling a void in American religion, growing audiences across digital platforms by steering young people to biblical answers to tough questions that aren't always answered in Sunday sermons.",
      "\u201cI can be that in-between \u2014 Monday to Saturday help \u2014 to give you practical things to make you feel like you\u2019re not walking this walk alone,\u201d said Megan Ashley, 35, sitting cross-legged in sweats on the couch where she records her \u201cIn Totality\u201d podcast.",
      "From myriad backgrounds, these influencers talk candidly to their listeners about everything from anxieties and doubts to dating and culture, delving into the Bible\u2019s complexities. Those of faith say Christian influencers are galvanizing young people looking for meaning in a culture that lacks it at a time when years of declining church attendance has slowed.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re making accessible is a truth that transforms people,\u201d said Lecrae Moore, a Christian rapper and podcaster. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s happening existentially \u2014 supernaturally \u2014 that I can\u2019t explain.\u201d",
      "Ashley and Moore are among a half-dozen popular influencers who described their work for this story. With and without formal theological they training, they describe themselves as churchgoers who don\u2019t want their messages boxed in by denominational labels.",
      "Some grew up in church; others didn\u2019t, but they commonly describe experiencing a spiritual transformation that came out of hardship or a sense of emptiness they pin on secular lifestyles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like, listen, we\u2019re two mess-ups too. It\u2019s OK,\u201d said Arielle Reitsma, 36, co-host of podcast \u201cGirls Gone Bible,\u201d which gets more than a million listens or streams each month.",
      "These algorithm-savvy podcasters fit comfortably in a long tradition of Christian celebrities, said Zachary Sheldon, a Baylor University lecturer on media, religion and culture who cited televangelist Billy Graham as an example. Working independently, they can harness audiences more easily than established congregations and media organizations can.",
      "\u201cExposing people to the faith and challenging them to ask questions and search for something more\u201d are really good things to do, Sheldon said. But he pointed to \u201cpotential dangers in granting them too much authority on the basis of their celebrity and their acumen with social media.\u201d",
      "These influencers encourage church attendance and describe reaching a variety of people, including those who have been particularly disconnected from religion, which polls show is a growing number of young Americans. Only 41% of people ages 18-35 surveyed in 2023-24 said they believe in God with certainty, down from 65% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cPeople are spiritually hungry, emotionally hungry, and I think for the first time ever \u2026 people are encountering Jesus even through online platforms, and they\u2019re realizing, this is true life and fulfillment,\u201d said Angela Halili, 29, Reitsma's co-host.",
      "The pair now draws live crowds since starting the podcast more than two years ago. At an event in Atlanta, they warned hundreds of fans against idolizing work or relationships, Bibles in hand, and recounted their days as Hollywood actors battling addiction, heartbreak and mental health disorders. Halili said God brought them \u201cradical healing,\u201d and they want listeners to know that God can perform \u201cmiracles\u201d in their lives, too.",
      "Afterward, they hugged and prayed for people in the audience, where Anna Williams, 17, said she considers both Reitsma and Halili to be \u201ca big sister\u201d in her life.",
      "Even as they espouse biblical principles as guidance toward true joy, influencers say that being Christian can be hard.",
      "God \u201cdoes make everything better, but that doesn\u2019t always come in the way that we think it\u2019s gonna come,\u201d said \u201cIn Totality\u201d host Ashley.",
      "Her current obsession, which she teaches with fervor, is a biblical passage about living as a sacrifice. God asks people to give up certain wants and behaviors so they can grow closer to him, Ashley says. She said her intensity grew after a healing encounter with God\u2019s \u201cseverity\u201d as a freshly divorced single mom plagued by suicidal thoughts and depression.",
      "Bible passages, day-to-day plights and heavier challenges are covered on \u201cWith the Perrys,\u201d a podcast led by husband and wife authors and spoken-word artists who also run a streetwear brand.",

      "\u201cIt is the all \u2014 how do we do all of this stuff in this weird flesh and weird world?\u201d said Jackie Hill Perry, 36.",
      "She is an admired speaker who is working towards her seminary degree and wrote a book about leaving behind same-sex relationships. She and husband Preston Perry, 39, started podcasting in 2019. Followers already resonated with Perry's theological debates and story of growing up around poverty and violence before finding faith and becoming a Christian evangelist.",
      "\u201cGod calls us to ruffle feathers sometimes, to speak to culture,\u201d Perry said.",
      "In a recent episode, the Perrys urged listeners to be honest with God about struggling to trust him. Through focused prayer, obedience and Bible reading, God brings lasting peace, answers and growth during hard circumstances, they say, but this requires more than quick fixes like scrolling and sex.",
      "At just 22, Bryce Crawford teaches Bible chapters on his self-named podcast and posts videos of himself talking to people about Christianity at Pride parades, the Burning Man counter-culture festival and a satanic temple.",
      "Rather than shout \u201crepent,\u201d Crawford\u2019s street evangelism aims to change minds through kindness. His followers say they're attracted by his empathetic yet bold demeanor while delivering talking points against lifestyles such as same-sex marriage.",
      "\u201cMy issue with \u2018repent or burn in hell\u2019 is that people get frustrated because they don\u2019t know why you\u2019re telling them that,\u201d said Crawford, who describes being severely anxious and bitter toward God until God healed him at a Waffle House. \u201cOur tactics have been one-on-one conversations, calmly listening, asking questions because we care about them, and in that explaining our worldview.\u201d",
      "These influencers acknowledge that online Christianity has its challenges.",
      "A hyperfocus on online drama and Christianity's more esoteric beliefs can miss the basics, such as love and Christ's sacrifice, Hill Perry said. She worries that \u201csimply talking about gentleness or respect or kindness or patience is gonna be boring\u201d to people.",
      "And the deep political and cultural rifts among Christians emerge online too.",
      "For example, Halili and Reitsma got pushback for taking the opportunity to pray at a pre-inauguration rally for President Donald Trump. The Perrys have been criticized by conservatives for talking about police brutality and racial injustice, and liberals for expressing opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "Some followers say these influencers provide a welcome alternative to the buttoned-up pastors they grew up with who spoke of God as a faraway deity that would reject them for breaking too many rules.",
      "\u201cI really needed someone who was a younger Black female portraying something that wasn\u2019t super traditional,\u201d said Olivia Singleton, 24. She's involved with her church and likes her pastor, but feels like these influencers are like \u201cone of the girls \u2026 walking out the faith with you.\u201d",

      "The algorithm has been a central issue in the security debate over TikTok. China previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law. But the U.S. regulation passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cuts ties \u2014 specifically the algorithm \u2014 with ByteDance.",

For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",

      "Isaacman, who has promised to bring a business-minded approach to the space agency, was confirmed in a bipartisan vote, 67-30.",

      "Titan instead may hold deep layers of ice and slush more akin to Earth\u2019s polar seas, with pockets of melted water where life could possibly survive and even thrive, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The team led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory challenged the decade-long assumption of a buried global ocean at Titan after taking a fresh look at observations made years ago by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft around Saturn.",
      "They stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system\u2019s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.",
      "But with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, \u201cthere is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,\u201d said the University of Washington\u2019s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "As to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, \u201cnature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.",
      "JPL\u2019s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan\u2019s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.",
      "Computer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).",
      "Because Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn\u2019s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon\u2019s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.",
      "Through improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan\u2019s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan\u2019s orientation in space supported their theory.",

      "For a long time, scientists could only make educated guesses about when wild animals were sleeping, observing when they lay still and closed their eyes. But in recent years, tiny trackers and helmets that measure brain waves \u2014 miniaturized versions of equipment in human sleep labs \u2014 have allowed researchers to glimpse for the first time the varied and sometimes spectacular ways that wild animals snooze.",

      "While flying, frigatebirds can sleep with one half of the brain at a time. The other half remains semialert so that one eye is still watching for obstacles in their flight path.",
      "This allows the birds to soar for weeks at a time, without touching land or water, which would damage their delicate, non-water repellent feathers.",
      "Frigatebirds can't do tricky maneuvers \u2014 flapping, foraging or diving \u2014 with just one half of their brain. When they dive for prey, they must be fully awake. But in flight, they have evolved to sleep when gliding and circling upward on massive drafts of warm rising air that keep them aloft with minimal effort.",
      "Back at the nest in trees or bushes, frigatebirds change up their nap routine \u2014 they are more likely to sleep with their whole brain at once and for much longer bouts. This suggests their in-flight sleeping is a specific adaptation for extended flying, Rattenborg said.",
      "A few other animals have similar sleeping hacks. Dolphins can sleep with one half of the brain at a time while swimming. Some other birds, including swifts and albatrosses, can sleep in flight, scientists say.",
      "Frigatebirds can fly 255 miles (410 kilometers) a day for more than 40 days, before touching land, other researchers found \u2014 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without being able to sleep on the wing.",

      "Each deep dive may last around 30 minutes. And for around a third of that time, the seals may be asleep, as research led by Jessica Kendall-Bar of Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed.",
      "Kendall-Bar's team devised a neoprene headcap similar to a swimming cap with equipment to detect motion and seal brain activity during dives, and retrieved the caps with logged data when seals returned to beaches in Northern California.",
      "The 13 female seals studied tended to sleep during the deepest portions of their dives, when they were below the depths that predators usually patrol.",
      "That sleep consisted of both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. During REM, or rapid eye movement sleep, the seals were temporarily paralyzed \u2014 just like humans during this deep-sleep stage \u2014 and their dive motion changed. Instead of a controlled downward glide motion, they sometimes turned upside down and spun in what the researchers called a \u201csleep spiral\u201d during REM sleep.",
      "In the span of 24 hours, the seals at sea slept for around two hours total. (Back on the beach, they averaged around 10 hours.)",
      "Scientists are still learning about all the reasons we sleep \u2014 and just how much we really need.",
      "It's unlikely that any tired human can try these extreme animal sleep hacks. But learning more about how varied napping may be in the wild shows the flexibility of some species. Nature has evolved to make shut-eye possible in even the most precarious situations.",

      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",
      "The Gift of Life Donor Program, which serves as the organ procurement network for eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, is supporting the pilot program with a grant of more than $100,000 from its foundation.",
      "So far, two of the five patients in the program through Temple University Hospital have found kidney donors, and one is preparing for surgery, according to Ryan Ihlenfeldt, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical transplant services. One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",
      "\u201cWe know that patients who are waiting don\u2019t always have the energy or the resources to do this themselves,\u201d Hasz said.",
      "There have been other ways for patients to set up \u201c microsites \u201d where they can tell their stories and seek a donor match. But the pilot program currently underway in Pennsylvania aims to connect patients with a wide universe of potential donors and produce videos and other ways to spread their message.",
      "Krissman's bout with an illness about two decades ago inspired him to tackle the sticky challenge of increasing live kidney donations. He was debilitated for more than a year before medication helped him recover, explaining, \u201cIt gave me my life back. And I never forgot what it's like to be chronically sick.\u201d",
      "After producing a podcast on kidney transplantation, Krissman recruited four patients through Facebook who were waiting for kidneys. He was able to help two of them. A second effort, a pilot program with three patients in North Carolina that ended last year, helped match all three with living donors.",

Living kidney donations are hard to come by \u2014 about 6,400 were transplanted last year. Thousands die each year waiting for an organ transplant in the United States.",
      "Living kidney donations can be a better match, reducing the risk of organ rejection. They allow for surgery to be planned for a time that is optimal for the donor, the recipient and the transplant team. And, the foundation says, living donor kidneys, on average, last longer than kidneys from deceased donors.",
      "The National Kidney Foundation says living donors must be at least 18 years old, although some transplant centers set the minimum age at 21. Potential donors get screened for health problems and can be ruled out if they have uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes or cancer, or if they are smokers.",

      "Meteor showers happen when space rocks hit Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds and burn up, gaining fiery tails \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d Random meteors are visible from Earth on any given clear night, but more predictable meteor showers happen yearly when Earth passes through streams of cosmic leftovers from comets or asteroids.",
      "The Ursids peak Sunday night into Monday morning and will be visible until Dec. 26 from the Northern Hemisphere. Skygazers usually see five to 10 meteors per hour during the height and there's a possibility for outbursts of up to 25 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "How active a shower will appear from Earth depends on the amount of debris and the moon's brightness, which can blot out glowing meteors. The Ursids feature less space debris than other showers like the Geminids, but the narrow crescent moon won't be much of an obstacle when they peak.",

      "WASHINGTON -- China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers funded by the Department of Energy to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications, according to a congressional report published Wednesday.",
      "The authors of the report say the U.S. must do more to protect high-tech research and ensure that the results of taxpayer-funded work don't end up benefiting Beijing. They recommended several changes to better protect scientific research in the U.S., including new policies for the Department of Energy to use when deciding whether to fund work that involves Chinese partnerships.",
      "The investigation is part of a congressional push to raise a firewall blocking U.S. research from boosting China's military buildup when the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry that will shape the future global order.",
      "Investigators from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce identified more than 4,300 academic papers published between June 2023 and June of this year that involved collaborations between DOE-funded scientists and Chinese researchers. About half of the papers involved Chinese researchers affiliated with China's military or industrial base.",
      "Particularly concerning, investigators found that federal funds went to research collaborations with Chinese state-owned laboratories and universities that work directly for China\u2019s military, including some listed in a Pentagon database of Chinese military companies with operations in the U.S. The report also detailed collaborations between U.S. researchers and groups blamed for cyberattacks as well as human rights abuses in China.",
      "The Energy Department routinely funds advanced research into nuclear energy and the development and disposal of nuclear weaponry, along with a long list of other high-tech fields like quantum computing, materials science and physics. It doles out hundreds of millions of dollars each year for research. The department oversees 17 national laboratories that have led the development in many technologies.",
      "The report followed a number of congressional investigations into federally funded research involving Chinese scientists and researchers. Last year, a report released by Republicans found that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade had allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology that could help strengthen its military. Another investigation this year revealed that the Pentagon in a recent two-year period funded hundreds of projects in collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense industry.",
      "The Energy Department has failed for decades to take steps to ensure the research it funds doesn't benefit China, the report's authors found. They made several recommendations to tighten the rules, including a new standardized approach to assessing the national security risks of research, as well as requirements that the department share information about research ties with China with other U.S. government agencies to make it easier to spot problems.",

    "story": [
      "Myanmar\u2019s military leadership has vowed to crack down on cyberscam centers, starting with the notorious KK Park",
      "It looked like a turning point in the global fight against scams. Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, under growing international pressure, vowed to wipe out the industrial-scale cyberscam centers that have taken root in the country. They started by raiding and then bombing KK Park \u2014 a notorious compound that has become a symbol of impunity in the battle against one of the most lucrative criminal industries in the world.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say whether KK Park will be abandoned, repurposed or rebuilt over time. But even if KK Park were to close, it\u2019s just one of around 30 scam compounds along Myanmar\u2019s border with Thailand \u2014 one indication that the crackdown may not turn out to be as deep or long-lasting as Myanmar\u2019s military rulers would like it to appear.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least two scam compounds in the area continued to use Starlink to get online even after SpaceX announced it had cut off service. And there are other signs the scam industry is adapting fast: The physical damage to KK Park sent thousands of workers scattering to other scam companies in Myanmar and abroad, interviews with current and former scam center workers show. Telegram is popping with job ads for newly displaced workers. And work has continued uninterrupted at other scam centers in Myanmar, where people trafficked from around the world still wait to be rescued.",
      "\u201cEven if you destroy buildings, if you haven\u2019t arrested the heads of the transnational syndicates behind this, seized their wealth and put them in jail, it\u2019s not a real crackdown yet,\u201d said Jay Kritiya, the coordinator of the Civil Society Network for Human Trafficking Victim Assistance.",
      "Myanmar state media announced the raid on KK Park on Oct. 20, which was followed by a weekslong demolition campaign. In November, Myanmar\u2019s military rulers pledged to \u201ceradicate scam activities from their roots.\u201d State media broadcast images of wreckage and soldiers standing with dozens of seized Starlink terminals. They then went after Shwe Kokko, another notorious compound that\u2019s been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. SpaceX announced it cut off access to more than 2,500 Starlink units in Myanmar, where they have been widely used by scammers to get online. And Meta said this month it had taken down 2,000 Facebook accounts used by scammers in Myanmar.",
      "It looked as if growing American pressure on foreign scam centers through sanctions, prosecutions and a new, high-level Scam Center Strike Force, was having swift impact as Myanmar prepares for national elections, which have been widely criticized as a sham effort to legitimize the army\u2019s 2021 seizure of power.",
      "Myanmar has said the demolition at KK Park \u2014 and raids at additional scam sites \u2014 are meant to ensure that criminal activity never returns. This month the government created a high-level task force to enact what it calls a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against scams. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Dec. 15 devoted five full pages to coverage of a press conference showcasing what it described as the government\u2019s aggressive efforts to stop fraud, and characterized cyberscams as the work of foreign criminal networks that have taken root in lawless borderlands controlled by insurgents.",
      "Government officials said that by Dec. 13, 413 buildings in KK Park had been \u201cdemolished\u201d and the remaining 222 would be cleared as well. Detailed visual analysis of the first wave of demolition, which the government says is complete, shows that 31 structures were flattened. At least 78 more were partially damaged, according to the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a London-based nonprofit focused on exposing human rights violations.",
      "More than half the buildings were damaged by heavy machinery, which often left roofs, ceilings and layers between floors intact, said Guy Fusfus, an investigator at Myanmar Witness, a CIR project. \u201cThere may be an intention to reconstruct and reuse these buildings,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "New satellite imagery shows that most buildings in KK Park appeared wholly or partially intact on Dec. 4, even as demolition had spread to other sections of the compound. Once home to thousands of workers, many victims of human trafficking, the streets of KK Park appeared empty. Where all those people went \u2014 and what that portends for the future of a criminal industry the FBI says cost Americans more than $16 billion last year \u2014 remain open questions.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just breaking windows and moving on. You can\u2019t come in and restart operations here at the same scale as before,\u201d said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO, who reviewed satellite images of the damage. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if that activity is just going to be displaced to other locations.\u201d",
      "Myanmar\u2019s track record of lasting enforcement is poor. Raids in response to Chinese pressure earlier this year failed to contain the growth of scam compounds, according to C4ADS, a U.S.-based nonprofit that takes a data-driven approach to conflict analysis. Over 7,000 scam center workers were released as part of that purge, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, but the scams kept on running.",
      "C4ADS examined satellite imagery of 21 known scam compounds in Myawaddy Township and found that 14 of them \u2014 including KK Park \u2014 had shown construction or expansion since January. Some solar panels also appeared \u2014 a step toward energy independence that could blunt the impact of crackdowns from neighboring Thailand, which has occasionally cut off power.",
      "\u201cThis continued growth of scam compounds is emblematic of the junta\u2019s inability to rein in the industry within Myanmar,\u201d said Michael Di Girolamo, a C4ADS analyst focused on cybercrime.",
      "Analysts say that some of the same people who led the raid on KK Park have profited from scams over the years. KK Park, like most scam compounds along the Thai border, operates under the protection of the Karen Border Guard Force \u2014 also known as the Karen National Army \u2014 an armed militia made up of ethnic Karen people who live in eastern Myanmar that is affiliated with the Myanmar military, according to U.S. and European government sanctions notices.",
      "Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the action at KK Park was a way for Myanmar\u2019s military leadership to relieve pressure, primarily from the U.S. and China, and continue to host highly lucrative criminal activity. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political will to crack down,\u201d he said.",
      "A month after KK Park was raided, another scam center fell, far from the glare of government propaganda. On Nov. 21, forces of the Karen National Union, a rebel group opposed to Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, stormed a scam compound called Shunda Park in an area controlled by a pro-government militia.",
      "\u201cThis looks much more like a real crackdown on crime,\u201d Tower said.",
      "While Myanmar state television broadcast images of a steamroller crushing rows of scammers\u2019 computers, the Karen National Union gathered 604 mobile phones, bank cards, computers and other evidence from Shunda and handed them over to Thai authorities for investigation.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.",
      "The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.",
      "After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.",
      "Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended.

      "The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration.

Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration \u2014 a \u201csomewhat successful\u201d assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.",

      "Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.",
      "California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.",
      "Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",

      "India\u2019s Parliament has approved new legislation to open the civil nuclear power sector to private companies",
      "NEW DELHI -- India\u2019s Parliament approved new legislation Thursday that enables opening the tightly controlled civil nuclear power sector to private companies.",
      "The government termed it a major policy shift to speed up clean energy expansion while the opposition political parties argued that it dilutes safety and liability safeguards.",
      "The lower house of parliament passed the legislation Wednesday and the upper house on Thursday. It now needs the assent from the Indian president, which is a formality, to come into force.",
      "The move carries global significance as India seeks to position itself as a major player in the next wave of nuclear energy, including with small modular reactors at a time many nations are reassessing nuclear power to meet climate targets and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.",
      "Supporters argue the legislation marks a decisive break from decades of state dominance in nuclear energy while critics say it opens the door to risks, mainly health hazards, that could have long term consequences.",
      "\u201cIt marks a momentous milestone for India and signals capable private sector players that the country is open for business in the nuclear energy space,\u201d said Karthik Ganesan, director of strategic partnerships at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a think tank.",
      "Junior Minister Jitendra Singh, who oversees the department of atomic energy, told lawmakers that the bill \u2014 which has been dubbed Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India \u2014 seeks to modernize India\u2019s nuclear framework in line with technological, economic and energy realities. It also retains and strengthens core safety, security and regulatory safeguards.",
      "\u201cIndia\u2019s role in geopolitics is increasing. And if we have to be a global player effectively, we have to live up to global benchmarks, follow global parameters and adopt global strategies,\u201d Singh said in the lower house, adding that the legislation was necessary to address the country\u2019s growing energy needs.",
      "India wants more nuclear power and has pledged over $2 billion in recent months toward research and allied activities. Nuclear power is a way to make electricity that doesn\u2019t emit planet-warming gases, although it does create radioactive waste.",
      "India is one of the world\u2019s biggest emitters of planet-heating gases and over 75% of its power is still generated by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal. India wants to install 100 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2047 \u2014 enough to power nearly 60 million Indian homes a year.",
      "Energy experts say that for the world to move away from carbon-polluting fuels like coal, oil and gas, sources like nuclear that don\u2019t rely on the sun and the wind \u2014 which aren\u2019t always available \u2014 are needed. But some are skeptical about India\u2019s ambitions as the country\u2019s nuclear sector is still very small, and negative public perceptions about the industry remain.",

      "\u201cThe bill doesn\u2019t have sufficient safeguards when it comes to mitigating the bad health of those impacted by living in areas closer to nuclear plants,\u201d Ashok Mittal, a lawmaker from the opposition Aam Admi Party, told The Associated Press.",
      "G. Sundarrajan, an anti-nuclear energy activist, called the bill a \u201cdisastrous law,\u201d saying it takes away essential safeguards that are needed to make sure companies invest in safety and reduce the chances of a major disaster that can impact millions from occurring.",
      "\u201cIt also provides little recourse for any Indian citizen to claim damages from nuclear companies even if they are affected by radiation leaks or suffer from any other health impact as a result of a nuclear plant in their region,\u201d he said.",

      "Trump admin paused immigration decisions for those from \"high-risk\" countries.",
      "On Dec. 4, Gail Breslow\u2019s client, a Haitian national, arrived at the historic Faneuil Hall to take her oath of citizenship. It was expected to be the culmination of several years of attorney fees and paperwork, and the final step before she could become a citizen.",
      "But when she arrived, Breslow said her client was told she would not be swearing in.",
      "\u201cShe was pulled out of line, she reported that others were as well. She was told that her ceremony was canceled and she should not enter the building,\u201d said Breslow, the executive director of Project Citizenship, an organization that represents migrants going through the naturalization process in Massachusetts.",
      "Breslow says her client is one of countless immigrants whose lives have been thrown into limbo and whose dreams of citizenship have been curtailed \u201cat the finish line\u201d as the Trump administration has paused immigration decisions for people from countries it deems to be \u201chigh-risk.\u201d",
      "After an Afghan national was suspected of fatally shooting one National Guard member and severely injuring another, the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions, expanded a travel ban, and has also cancelled naturalization ceremonies across the country.",
      "The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges",
      "In a memo issued on Dec. 2, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said those subject to the directive may have to undergo \u201ca thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats.\u201d",
      "Critics of the move say the administration is using the November shooting as a way to scapegoat immigrants and advance their deportation agenda.",
      "\u201cUSCIS has paused all adjudications for aliens from high-risk countries while USCIS works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible. The pause will allow for a comprehensive examination of all pending benefit requests for aliens from the designated high-risk countries. The safety of the American people always comes first,\u201d a DHS spokesperson told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Since early December, Breslow says at least 21 of her clients have been told not to show up to their naturalization ceremony, the final and necessary step that immigrants have to complete after they\u2019ve undergone several rounds of vetting and interviews and have been told they\u2019ve been approved for citizenship.",
      "\u201cThese actions that the administration is taking are not making our country safer by any stretch, and it's a thinly veiled effort to encourage people who are from particular backgrounds, whether it's religious or ethnic or racial, to up and leave. I won't say to go home, because this is their home, but this is xenophobia at its most stark,\u201d Breslow said.",
      "In November, an Afghan woman who came to the United States in 2018 under a Special Immigrant Visa, which grants legal residency to people who have helped the U.S. government abroad, had an oath ceremony scheduled, but was unable to attend because she was hospitalized, her attorney Habib Hasbini told ABC News. Hasibini says his client cooked for soldiers in Afghanistan and that her son helped translate for them. Although the ceremony was rescheduled for December, she received notice that the ceremony had been canceled for her.",

      "It\u2019s the latest move the administration has threatened as they continue to crack down on not only undocumented immigrants, but those who are here legally as well. Earlier this month, an administration official told ABC News USCIS field officers were directed to refer up to 200 cases each month for potential denaturalizations, but the official said the guidance may change.",
      "Attorney Josh Goldstein says there may be some legal recourse for people waiting to hear back if their citizenship application was approved after they\u2019ve already interviewed with USCIS.",
      "Under current policies, the government typically has 120 days to make a decision. If that time period expires without a decision, applicants may be able to petition for a federal judge to move the process along or, as in the case of a client of his in 2008, swear them in on the spot.",

However, four days before the ceremony, he received an email saying it had been canceled.",
      "\u201cHe told me his mom had bought a dress and his family was going to go support him and go out for a nice meal after,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cImagine any U.S. citizen having this occur to them, they would go crazy.\u201d",
      "Raouf\u2019s green card is still valid for another five years, which gives Goldman some relief, he says. In a statement to ABC News, Raouf said he will \u201cremain patient.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing would make me more proud than to become a U.S. citizen. I hope it will happen soon and will remain patient while we work through these difficult times. While I'm disappointed with what occurred the week of December 1, I know that I will someday become a citizen,\u201d he said.",

      "A 13-year-old girl at a Louisiana middle school got into a fight with classmates who were sharing AI-generated nude images of her",
      "THIBODAUX, La. -- The teasing was relentless. Nude images of a 13-year-old girl and her friends, generated by artificial intelligence, were circulating on social media and had become the talk of a Louisiana middle school.",
      "The girls begged for help, first from a school guidance counselor and then from a sheriff\u2019s deputy assigned to their school. But the images were shared on Snapchat, an app that deletes messages seconds after they\u2019re viewed, and the adults couldn\u2019t find them. The principal had doubts they even existed.",
      "Among the kids, the pictures were still spreading. When the 13-year-old girl stepped onto the Lafourche Parish school bus at the end of the day, a classmate was showing one of them to a friend.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I got angry,\u201d the eighth grader recalled at her discipline hearing.",
      "Fed up, she attacked a boy on the bus, inviting others to join her. She was kicked out of Sixth Ward Middle School for more than 10 weeks and sent to an alternative school. She said the boy whom she and her friends suspected of creating the images wasn\u2019t sent to that alternative school with her. The 13-year-old girl\u2019s attorneys allege he avoided school discipline altogether.",
      "When the sheriff's department looked into the case, they took the opposite actions. They charged two of the boys who'd been accused of sharing explicit images \u2014 and not the girl.",
      "The Louisiana episode highlights the nightmarish potential of AI deepfakes. They can, and do, upend children's lives \u2014 at school, and at home. And while schools are working to address artificial intelligence in classroom instruction, they often have done little to prepare for what the new tech means for cyberbullying and harassment.",
      "Once again, as kids increasingly use new tech to hurt one another, adults are behind the curve, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University focused on emerging technology.",
      "\u201cWhen we ignore the digital harm, the only moment that becomes visible is when the victim finally breaks,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "In Lafourche Parish, the school district followed all its protocols for reporting misconduct, Superintendent Jarod Martin said in a statement. He said a \u201cone-sided story\u201d had been presented of the case that fails to illustrate its \"totality and complex nature.\u201d",
      "After hearing rumors about the nude images, the 13-year-old said she marched with two friends \u2014 one nearly in tears \u2014 to the guidance counselor around 7 a.m. on Aug. 26. The Associated Press isn\u2019t naming her because she is a minor and because AP doesn\u2019t normally name victims of sexual crimes.",
      "She was there for moral support, not initially realizing there were images of her, too, according to testimony at her school disciplinary hearing.",
      "Ultimately, the weeks-long investigation at the school in Thibodaux, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of New Orleans, uncovered AI-generated nude images of eight female middle school students and two adults, the district and sheriff's office said in a joint statement.",
      "\u201cFull nudes with her face put on them\u201d is how the girl\u2019s father, Joseph Daniels, described them.",
      "Until recently, it took some technical skill to make realistic deepfakes. Technology now makes it easy to pluck a photo off social media, \u201cnudify\u201d it and create a viral nightmare for an unsuspecting classmate.",
      "Most schools are \u201cjust kind of burying their heads in the sand, hoping that this isn\u2019t happening,\u201d said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University.",
      "Lafourche Parish School District was just starting to develop policies on artificial intelligence. The school-level AI guidance mainly addressed academics, according to documents provided through a records request. The district also hadn\u2019t updated its training on cyberbullying to reflect the threat of AI-generated, sexually explicit images. The curriculum its schools used was from 2018.",
      "Although the girls at Sixth Ward Middle School hadn\u2019t seen the images firsthand, they heard about them from boys at school. Based on those conversations, the girls accused a classmate and two students from other schools of creating and spreading the nudes on Snapchat and possibly TikTok.",
      "The principal, Danielle Coriell, said an investigation came up cold that day as no student took responsibility. The deputy assigned to the school searched social media for the images unsuccessfully, according to a recording of the disciplinary hearing.",
      "\u201cI was led to believe that this was just hearsay and rumors,\u201d the girl\u2019s father said, recounting a conversation he had that morning with the school counselor.",
      "But the girl was miserable, and a police incident report showed more girls were reporting that they were victims, too. The 13-year-old returned to the counselor in the afternoon, asking to call her father. She said she was refused.",
      "Her father says she sent a text message that said, \u201cDad,\u201d and nothing else. They didn't talk. With the mocking unrelenting, the girl texted her sister, \u201cIt\u2019s not getting handled.\u201d",
      "As the school day wound down, the principal was skeptical. At the disciplinary hearing, the girl\u2019s attorney asked why the sheriff's deputy didn\u2019t check the phone of the boy the girls were accusing and why he was allowed on the same bus as the girl.",
      "\u201cKids lie a lot,\u201d responded Coriell, the principal. \u201cThey lie about all kinds of things. They blow lots of things out of proportion on a daily basis. In 17 years, they do it all the time. So to my knowledge, at 2 o\u2019clock when I checked again, there were no pictures.\u201d",
      "When the girl stepped onto the bus 15 minutes later, the boy was showing the AI-generated images to a friend. Fake nude images of her friends were visible on the boy\u2019s phone, the girl said, a claim backed up by a photo taken on the bus. A video from the school bus showed at least a half-dozen students circulating the images, said Martin, the superintendent, at a school board meeting.",

      "Video of the fight was posted on Facebook. \u201cOverwhelming social media sentiment was one of outrage and a demand that the students involved in the fight be held accountable,\u201d the district and sheriff\u2019s office said in their joint statement released in November.",

      "It was on the day of the girl\u2019s disciplinary hearing, three weeks after the fight, that the first of the boys was charged.",
      "The student was charged with 10 counts of unlawful dissemination of images created by artificial intelligence under a new Louisiana state law, part of a wave of such legislation around the country. A second boy was charged in December with identical charges, the sheriff's department said. Neither was identified by authorities because of their ages.",
      "The girl would face no charges because of what the sheriff\u2019s office described as the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d",
      "At the disciplinary hearing, the principal refused to answer questions from the girl\u2019s attorneys about what kind of school discipline the boy would face.",
      "The district said in a statement that federal student privacy laws prohibit it from discussing individual students\u2019 disciplinary records. Gregory Miller, an attorney for the girl, said he has no knowledge of any school discipline for the classmate accused of sharing the images.",
      "Ultimately, the panel expelled the 13-year-old. She wept, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe just felt like she was victimized multiple times \u2014 by the pictures and by the school not believing her and by them putting her on a bus and then expelling her for her actions,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "After she was sent to the alternative school, the girl started skipping meals, her father said. Unable to concentrate, she completed none of the school's online work for several days before her father got her into therapy for depression and anxiety.",
      "Nobody initially noticed when she stopped doing her assignments, her father said.",
      "\u201cShe kind of got left behind,\u201d he said.",
      "Her attorneys appealed to the school board, and another hearing was scheduled for seven weeks later.",
      "By then, so much time had passed that she could have returned to her old school on probation. But because she\u2019d missed assignments before getting treated for depression, the district wanted her to remain at the alternative site another 12 weeks.",
      "For students who are suspended or expelled, the impact can last years. They're more likely to be suspended again.

      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security has dropped its plan to deport a Chinese national who entered the country illegally, two rights activists said Monday, after his plight raised public concerns that the man, if deported, would be punished by Beijing for helping expose human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer who assisted in the case, said Guan Heng's lawyer received a letter from DHS stating its decision to withdraw its request to send Guan to Uganda. Asat said she now expects Guan\u2019s asylum case to \u201cproceed smoothly and favorably.\u201d",
      "Zhou Fengsuo, executive director of the advocacy group Human Rights in China, also confirmed the administration's decision not to deport Guan. \u201cWe're really happy,\u201d Zhou said.",

      "His legal team is working to secure his release from an ICE detention facility in New York on bond, both Zhou and Asat said.",
      "Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, which activists say have been used to lock up as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities in the region, especially the Uyghurs. Beijing has denied allegations of rights abuses and says it has run vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.",
      "Knowing he could not release the video footage while in China, Guan left the mainland in 2021 for Hong Kong and then flew to Ecuador, which at the time did not require visas for Chinese nationals. He then traveled to the Bahamas, where he bought a small inflatable boat and an outboard motor before setting off for Florida, according to the nongovernmental organization Human Rights in China.",
      "After nearly 23 hours at sea, Guan reached the coastline of Florida, according to the group, and his video footage of the detention facilities was released on YouTube, providing further evidence of rights abuse in Xinjiang, the rights group said.",

      "A federal judge must decide whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia should return to immigration custody after being free for just over a week",
      "GREENBELT, Md. -- A federal judge on Monday will hear arguments about whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be returned to immigration custody after being free for just over a week.",
      "Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation to El Salvador has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate, had been in immigration detention since August. In that time, the government has said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia. However, officials have made no effort to deport him to the one country he has agreed to go to \u2014 Costa Rica. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, in Maryland, has even accused the government of misleading her by falsely claiming that Costa Rica was unwilling to take him.",
      "The government's \u201cpersistent refusal to acknowledge Costa Rica as a viable removal option, their threats to send Abrego Garcia to African countries that never agreed to take him, and their misrepresentation to the Court that Liberia is now the only country available to Abrego Garcia, all reflect that whatever purpose was behind his detention, it was not for the \u2018basic purpose\u2019 of timely third-country removal,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Xinis\u2019 Dec. 11 order that Abrego Garcia be released from immigration custody also concluded that the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019 had failed to issue an order of removal from the U.S., and he cannot be deported anywhere without a removal order.",
      "Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there from a gang that had targeted his family. In March, he was mistakenly deported there anyway. U.S. officials resisted calls to bring him back until the Supreme Court weighed in. However, officials have said he cannot stay in the U.S. and have vowed to deport him to a third country.",
      "In filings last week, government attorneys argued that, with or without a final order of removal, they are still working to deport Abrego Garcia, so they can legally detain him during the process.",

      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that \u201cbecause immigration proceedings \u2018are civil, not criminal\u2019 detention must be \u2018nonpunitive.\u2019\u201d They argued that in Abrego Garcia's case, detention is punitive because the government wants to be allowed to hold him indefinitely without a viable plan to deport him.",
      "\u201cIf immigration detention does not serve the legitimate purpose of effectuating reasonably foreseeable removal, it is punitive, potentially indefinite, and unconstitutional,\u201d they wrote.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- Sudan\u2019s prime minister on Monday proposed a wide-ranging peace initiative to end a nearly 1,000-day war with a rival paramilitary force, but the United States urged both sides to accept the Trump administration\u2019s call for an immediate humanitarian truce.",
      "Kamil Idris, who heads Sudan\u2019s transitional civilian government, told the Security Council his plan calls for a ceasefire monitored by the United Nations, African Union and Arab League, and the withdrawal of paramilitary forces from all areas they occupy, their placement in supervised camps and their disarmament.",
      "Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces exploded into open fighting, with widespread mass killings and rapes, and ethnically motivated violence. This has amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.",
      "It seemed highly unlikely the RSF would support the prime minister\u2019s proposal, which would essentially give government forces a victory and take away their military power.",

      "In early November, the Rapid Support Forces agreed to a humanitarian truce. At that time, a Sudanese military official told The Associated Press the army welcomed the Quad\u2019s proposal but would only agree to a truce when the RSF completely withdraws from civilian areas and gives up their weapons \u2014 key provisions in the plan Idris put forward on Monday.",
      "Idris said unless the paramilitary forces were confined to camps, a truce had \u201cno chance for success.\u201d He challenged the 15 members of the Security Council to back his proposal.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can mark the moment when Sudan steps back from the edge and the international community \u2014 You!

      "The \u201cHome Alone\u201d movies turned holiday travel chaos into comedy",
      "Panic erupts in the McCallister household as soon as the day begins. The parents' alarm clock never rings, bags and coats spill across the floor, and the family barrels out the door to catch a flight to Florida.",
      "The pandemonium intensifies at the airport. There, the McCallisters must dodge fellow holiday travelers and luggage as they sprint to their gate while final boarding calls echo overhead. Amid the mayhem, 10-year-old Kevin accidentally boards the wrong plane and finds himself alone in New York City just days before Christmas.",
      "More than 30 years after \u201cHome Alone\u201d turned travel chaos into comedy, the frantic opening scenes of the movie's 1992 sequel still hit close to home, especially as the busy year-end travel period gets underway. But would Kevin McCallister still end up \u201cLost in New York\u201d in 2025?",
      "In an age of federal airport security checkpoints and digitized air travel, the fictional character played by Macaulay Culkin almost certainly wouldn't have gotten onto a commercial airliner by himself, said Sheldon Jacobson, who studies air travel operations and security and whose research contributed to the design of TSA PreCheck.",
      "\u201cIn the 1990s, it was plausible,\" Sheldon said. \u201cIt was close enough to plausible that people weren\u2019t rolling their eyes at it, but this would not happen today.\u201d",
      "The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks fundamentally changed how Americans move through airports, ushering the creation of the Transportation Security Administration, government-run security screenings, mandatory ID checks and restricted gate access. Before 9/11, travelers could head straight to their plane with little more than a paper ticket. Now, every passenger and bag is screened, names are checked against flight manifests and access beyond security checkpoints is tightly controlled.",
      "Even the paper tickets that made Kevin's mix-up possible are largely a thing of the past. In the film, Kevin frantically trails a man wearing a coat like his father's to the wrong gate at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, then crashes into an airline agent, sending both his ticket and a stack of boarding passes fluttering to the floor. Kevin explains that his family is already on the plane and he doesn't want to get left behind.",
      "\u201cDo you have a boarding pass?\u201d the agent asks. Kevin gestures to the pile of paper tickets and is ultimately allowed onto the plane.",
      "Today, boarding passes are tied to specific passengers, often stored on smartphones and scanned at the gate to confirm travelers are on the correct flight. The stricter unaccompanied minor policies and fees of airlines would add yet another layer of protection today, Jacobson said.",
      "In the movie, the gate agent walks Kevin down the jet bridge and asks if he spots his family onboard. Kevin points to the stranger he\u2019s mistaken for his father. The agent waves him on, tells him to grab an empty seat and that's that.",
      "Unaccompanied minors are closely tracked today. Most carriers require children under a certain age, often 14 or younger, to be formally registered as unaccompanied minors if they aren't traveling with an adult, Jacobson said. That comes with special paperwork and airline staff members who are assigned to escort a child through the airport, to their seat on the plane and off the plane at their destination.",
      "The Biden administration proposed a rule last year to ban airlines from charging families additional fees to sit together on flights and requiring them to seat children ages 13 and under next to an accompanying adult when adjacent seating is available at booking. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month he had no update on the proposal.",

      "Even if every current safeguard somehow failed, a passenger on the wrong plane would get noticed quickly, Jacobson said. Flight attendants review passenger counts and special-service lists before departure. A 10-year-old boy missing from one flight and an extra child on another would trigger immediate alarms.",
      "In other words, the movie magic holds up 33 years after \u201cHome Alone 2: Lost in New York\u201d came out. The logistics do not, Jacobson said.",
      "\u201cWe take for granted that we had those freedoms back then that we don\u2019t have today, for good reason,\" he said. \"We had to give up those freedoms in exchange for other freedoms, like safer air travel.\u201d",
      "The December holidays still can be a hectic time to travel. This year, 122.4 million Americans were expected to travel at least 50 miles (80 kilometers) from home between Saturday and New Year\u2019s Day, topping last year\u2019s record of 119.7 million, according to AAA's holiday forecast.",
      "\u201cHoliday celebrations look different for everyone, but the common thread is the desire to travel, whether it\u2019s returning to your hometown or exploring new destinations,\" Stacey Barber, vice president of AAA Travel, said.",
      "About 89% of holiday travelers, or 109.5 million people, are expected to go by car, while more than 8 million are expected to take domestic flights, AAA said. The passenger numbers would be a record for the holiday period despite domestic roundtrip flights costing an average of 7% more compared to last year, according to AAA data.",
      "Back in a fictional 1992, Kevin pulls off a luxurious stay at Manhattan's Plaza Hotel, where he briefly crosses paths with Donald Trump, who owned the hotel from 1988 to 1995. Trump's past connection to the hotel and his brief movie cameo have sometimes come up during his political career and presidencies.",
      "The same burglars who terrorized the McCallister family's Chicago home in the first \u201cHome Alone\" are in New York for the sequel, plotting to steal a toy store\u2019s cash donations for a children\u2019s hospital. With a mischievous grin, Kevin sets a series of over-the-top traps, sending the crooks tumbling, slipping and screaming through the store and thwarting their Christmas Eve scheme.",
      "When the thrill of his solo adventure fades, Kevin misses his family and makes a wish to see his mother \u2014 \u201ceven if it's just once and only for a couple minutes,\" he says. \"I just need to tell her I'm sorry.\u201d At that very moment, his mom appears, and they reunite beneath the twinkling Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful story element,\u201d Adam Paul, a film professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said of the holiday chaos central to the \u201cHome Alone\u201d movies. \u201cBut it is ultimately a great representation of how and why we make these journeys.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Justice has published thousands of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday published thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a release long anticipated for its potential to reveal new details about the late sex offender and his connections to powerful people.",
      "But it was clear soon after the release that it would fall far short of those expectations. The partial release angered Democrats who accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information. The Justice Department said it would continue releasing documents in the weeks ahead.",
      "The file dump \u2014 dominated by photographs, but also including call logs, court records and other documents, many with redactions \u2014 comes after politicians and the public waged a massive campaign for transparency about the government's investigations into the wealthy financier.",
      "President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. Though he hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, he has argued there is nothing to see in the files and the public should focus on other issues.",
      "On Nov. 19, relenting to political pressure from his fellow Republicans, he signed a bill mandating the release of most of the Justice Department\u2019s files on Epstein within 30 days. The White House said Friday\u2019s release of the files shows how the administration is the \u201cmost transparent in history.\u201d",
      "Here are some takeaways about the Justice Department's initial Epstein file release:",
      "The law signed by Trump last month set Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to release most of its files about Epstein.",
      "Ahead of the release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News he expected several hundred thousand files to be released Friday, along with several hundred thousand more to come later.",
      "But the number of files that actually landed on the Justice Department's website seemed to be a thin slice of the total number expected. Blanche acknowledged in a letter to Congress that the production of files was incomplete. The department said it expected to complete its production of Epstein documents by the end of the year.",
      "Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files \u2014 mostly photographs \u2014 under a subset the Justice Department described as \u201cDOJ Disclosures.\" The vast majority of the photographs were taken by the FBI during searches of Epstein\u2019s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Also included were images of envelopes, folders and boxes containing investigative materials from various probes related to Epstein. Many records are redacted and anything containing a victim\u2019s personally identifiable information, including materials depicting sexual and physical abuse, isn\u2019t authorized for release.",
      "Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees. At least some of that material has already circulated in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.",
      "Many of the most discussed photos from the files show the former Democratic president. Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes.",
      "Some of the photos show Clinton on a private plane, including one with a woman seated next to him with her arm around him. Her face is redacted from the photo.",
      "Another photo shows him in a pool with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, and with another person whose face is redacted. One shows him with the late pop star Michael Jackson, singer Diana Ross and a woman whose face is redacted.",

      "Angel Ure\u00f1a, Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said in an X post that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about Bill Clinton\u201d and accused the White House of trying to protect others.",
      "\u201cThere are two types of people here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We\u2019re in the first.\u201d",
      "Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone\u2019s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise.",
      "To some exploring the records released Friday, the most interesting parts were which high-profile figures appeared scarcely \u2014 or not at all.",
      "For example, Trump is minimally referenced in the files, and the small number of photos that do show him appear to have been in the public domain for decades. The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.",
      "The release does include at least one photo of the former Prince Andrew, who appears in a tuxedo lying on the laps of what appear to be several women who are seated, dressed in formalwear. One of Epstein\u2019s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with men, including the prince.",
      "Marina Lacerda, one of the women who says she survived sexual assault by Epstein, beginning when she was 14 years old, said Friday she wanted to see greater transparency from the Justice Department and expressed frustration over redactions and the incomplete release.",
      "\u201cJust put out the files,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd stop redacting names that don\u2019t need to be redacted.\u201d",
      "Several lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for failing to produce all the documents required under the law.",
      "Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had introduced what is known as a discharge petition, which eventually led to the congressional vote that forced the release of the Epstein files. On Friday, both took to social media to criticize the partial release.",
      "Massie wrote that it \u201cgrossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\u201d Khanna called the release so far \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're going to push for the actual documents,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that by disregarding the deadline, the administration was denying justice to Epstein's victims. He added he was \u201cexploring all avenues and legal tools to get justice for the victims and transparency for the American people.\u201d",
      "If Democratic lawmakers so choose, they could go to court to force the Justice Department to comply with the law, but that would almost certainly be a lengthy process that plays out while the department releases more files.",
      "Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files. That could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee, but it would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.",

      "Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer\u2019s...",
      "NEW YORK -- Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer\u2019s parent company.",
      "Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department\u2019s charge to turn Mangione\u2019s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a \u201cprofound conflict of interest\u201d that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "By involving herself in the death penalty decision and making public statements suggesting that Mangione deserves execution, Bondi broke a vow she made before taking office in February that she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year, Mangione\u2019s lawyers said.",
      "They argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard \u2014 and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group \u2014 through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.",
      "The \u201cvery person\u201d empowered to seek Mangione\u2019s death \"has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,\u201d his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest \u201cshould have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,\u201d they added.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.",
      "Bondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group\u2019s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.",
      "Friday\u2019s filing put the focus back on Mangione\u2019s federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.",
      "Mangione\u2019s defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi\u2019s past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.",

      "Bondi\u2019s statements and other official actions \u2014 including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration\u2019s flouting of established death penalty procedures \u2014 \u201chave violated Mr. Mangione\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,\u201d his lawyers said.",
      "In a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that \u201cpretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.\u201d",
      "Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense\u2019s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione\u2019s rights are respected at trial.",
      "\u201cWhat the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments\u201d rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. \u201cNone warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.\u201d",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyers said they want to investigate Bondi\u2019s ties to Ballard and the firm\u2019s relationship with UnitedHealth Group and will ask for various materials, including details of Bondi\u2019s compensation from the firm, any direction she's given Justice Department employees regarding the case or UnitedHealthcare, and sworn testimony from \u201call individuals with personal knowledge of the relevant matters.\"",

      "Manilow, 82, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Instagram that an MRI scan detected \"a cancerous spot\" on one of his lungs after he suffered a lengthy bout of bronchitis in the midst of a residency in Palm Springs, California.",
      "\"As many of you know I recently went through six weeks of bronchitis followed by a relapse of another five weeks. Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK,\" Manilow said in the statement. \"The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed.\"",
      "\"It's pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early,\" Manilow said, adding that he is going to have surgery to have the spot removed.",
      "\"The doctors do not believe it has spread, and I'm taking tests to confirm their diagnosis,\" he said. \"So, that's it. No chemo. No radiation. Just chicken soup and I Love Lucy reruns.\"",
      "Manilow just finished a string of Christmas shows at the McCallum Theatre in Palm Springs. His January concert dates will be rescheduled as he recovers from surgery, he said.",
      "The singer assured fans that he will be back to work by February and intends to perform Valentine's Day weekend in Las Vegas, where he has a lifetime residency. He was scheduled to perform in other U.S. cities on a tour starting in early January. The January shows were slated to take place at arenas in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia, according to the singer's website. Manilow said in his statement Monday they would be pushed back to February, March and April. Manilow's tour will take him to the United Kingdom later in the year.",
      "\"I'm very sorry that you have to change your plans,\" he said.",
      "\"Just like you, we were all looking forward to the January shows and hate having to move everything around,\" he added. \"In the meantime, I'm counting the days until I return to my home away from home at the Westgate Las Vegas for our Valentine's weekend concerts on February 12-13-14 and throughout 2026. Something tells me that February weekend is going to be one big party.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner's circle was wide and eclectic, spanning comedians honing punchlines and Oscar-winning actors and filmmakers shaping Hollywood itself.",
      "As the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, he entered the world of entertainment early, but went on to make a name for himself as a director, filmmaker, and actor in his own right.",
      "He's perhaps best known for his breakout role at age 23 as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in the hit 1970s sitcom \"All in the Family,\" though others may know him more recently as Bob Day, the father of the quirky Jess Day in \"New Girl.\" Reiner also directed iconic films such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "Friends and colleagues who worked with Reiner through the years sat down with CBS News to share their personal anecdotes and fond memories of him following the news of his tragic death. Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14 and their son, Nick, was charged in their murders.",
      "Here's a look at some tributes from those who knew Reiner best, featured in \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" a one-hour special\u00a0broadcast Sunday after \"60 Minutes\" on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Albert Brooks",
      "Albert Brooks said he's still in disbelief over the death of his good friend, who he's known since the pair attended drama class together at Beverly Hills High School more than 60 years ago. He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Kathy Bates",
      "Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates has credited Reiner with changing \"the course of [her] life\" by directing her unforgettable performance as Annie Wilkes in \"Misery\" in 1990.",
      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "She recalled Reiner's enthusiasm when she walked on stage to accept her Oscar for Best Actress in 1991.",
      "\"When they called my name, I looked over and Rob was standing and he was just pounding his fist together going, 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'\" she recalled.",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",
      "\"They had planned to shoot the whole day, and Rob looked at everybody and said, 'I couldn't ask for anything more, so you guys all have the rest of the day off,\" Sutherland said.",
      "Annette Bening",
      "Annette Bening played Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist and love interest of widower President Andrew Shepherd, portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1995 political romantic comedy, \"The American President.\" During filming, Bening said Reiner made it a priority as the movie's director to ensure the cast and crew could spend quality time with their families.",
      "\"On the set, he had that kind of enthusiasm that is infectious. The leader sets the tone, right? So he was wonderful that way. And a real avid family man,\" Bening said.",
      "She added, \"He would insist that the day ended at a sane time, which in show business is kind of unusual. But, he said, 'No, we want everyone to be able to have dinner with their kids.'\"",
      "Michael Douglas",
      "Like Reiner, Michael Douglas was also born to Hollywood royalty, the son of Kirk Douglas.",
      "\"Well, my experience was, watching him, that I could never be the man that my father was. He could do everything, you know, I mean he was Spartacus. Once you go into the same business, it stares you in the face,\" Douglas said. \"And, in Rob's case, are you as funny as your father? But that I think is also what created his tenacity, his strength, and that's something that's not really talked about enough with Rob, about his endurance.\"",
      "Douglas said Reiner was \"spectacular\" to work with in \"The American President.\" \"He was looking out for you,\" he said.",
      "Jerry O'Connell",
      "When Jerry O'Connell was 11, he was cast as the shy but loyal Vern Tessio in the 1986 coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me.\" He met Reiner for the first time at his audition for the film, and recalled Reiner putting him at ease. He said Reiner was like a father figure to him during that time, and the years after.",
      "Months after the movie came out, when he was 12 years old, O'Connell said Reiner took him out to lunch in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He took me out to lunch, man. He didn't have to do that, You know what I'm saying? It was months after the movie came out. He was a busy man, and he took a 12-year-old me out to lunch. Just to be like, 'Thanks so much. What a great movie,'\" O'Connell recalled, with tears in his eyes. \"That lunch meant so much to me, you know? It's just stuff that kids need to hear.\"",
      "Mandy Patinkin",
      "Mandy Patinkin played Inigo Montoya, a Spanish swordsman, in Reiner's 1987 film adaptation of \"The Princess Bride.\" It was the role of a lifetime.",
      "After wrapping up filming, Patinkin said the cast was invited to come out to Los Angeles to see the first rough cut together. When the film was over, Patinkin turned in the screening room and said he \"never dreamed\" he would get to be in something like this.",
      "\"I didn't even have time to dream it. And he made that dream for me. And I don't go anywhere, where some child or adult or grandfather comes up to me and says, 'Say the line,'\" said Patinkin of his famous line, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "The word that came to min when Patinkin heard the news about Reiner and his wife, Michele: \"Inconceivable.\" He said he doesn't know how to process it and he's not looking to understand how to process it.",
      "\"Rob worked hard to try to get me the best human being I could be. One time he said to me, 'I just wish you could get out of your own way.' And I haven't been able to achieve that to this day, but I won't quit trying. He cared about my nature. He showed it to me over and over again,\" Patinkin said. \"I believe that we can connect with Rob and Michele. And every time we're thinking about this or talking about it or anybody tells a story, he's here. He's here with you. He will not be forgotten.\"",

      "For his parents' classic, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over),\" Lennon looked for new ways for the song to be heard. \"I wanted to see if I could get that feeling of maybe it sounds like you're hearing it again for the first time, or at least in a new context, in a way that you'd pay attention, as opposed to, 'Oh, there it is on the radio again.'\"",
      "Lennon collaborated with former Pixar animator Dave Mullins to make a short film, \"War Is Over!\" \"We came up with this idea that two soldiers would be playing chess on opposite sides of a war,\" Lennon said. \"I'd also read an article that there were sort of heroic messenger pigeons from World War I and World War II.\"",
      "The 11-minute film, now on YouTube, won an Academy Award last year for best animated short. \"It felt like a Miss Universe pageant or something,\" Lennon said, \"and I was just standing there kind of crying.\"",
      "He used the moment to shout-out his mom: \"So, could everyone please say, 'Happy Mother's Day, Yoko!'\"",
      "\"It's a personal thing\"",
      "Lennon said, \"My parents gave me so much that I think it's the least I can do to try and support their legacy in my lifetime. I feel like I just owe it to them. It's a personal thing.\"",
      "What does he see is their legacy? \"Peace and love,\" he said. \"But it's not just peace and love. It's an attitude towards activism that is done with humor and love.\"",
      "That attitude is visible in the new HBO documentary \"One to One,\" about John and Yoko's 1972 benefit concert at Madison Square Garden \u2013 the only concert John and Yoko had done together. \"The only full-length concert,\" Lennon said, \"certainly the only concert I think that he played a Beatles song, too (\"Come Together\"), because I think he was just in a good mood.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"One to One,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The concert occurred during Lennon's first years in New York, when he was fighting a bitter deportation battle with the Nixon administration, in part because of his anti-war activism.",
      "Featured in the film, said Lennon, were recordings he'd never heard: \"They found these phone calls that my parents had recorded of themselves which, interestingly, was a response to the FBI tapping their phones. So, they thought, 'Well, we need to tap our own phones. Because if they try to say we said something that we didn't say, we'll have our own record of it.'\"",
      "The documentary captures John and Yoko at a critical time in their lives. \"Yeah, and you know, it's my origin story actually,\" said Lennon. \"If you think about it, they came to New York, and that's the only reason I exist.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see something you maybe didn't see before? Or have you seen it all before?\"",
      "\"I hadn't seen all of the home video footage in 'One to One,'\" he said. \"I hadn't heard those phone recordings before. It's like getting more moments to spend with my dad. So actually, for me on a personal level, it just really means a lot.\"",
      "Sean produced the music (also released as a box set). He's working on his own new album, too, his third with the Claypool Lennon Delirium, which he describes as \"kind of a whimsical prog rock, experimental psych band. It's fun!\"",
      "The Claypool Lennon Delirium performs \"Blood and Rockets\":",
      "Lennon and James McCartney (Paul's son) have also been working on a new song with Zak Starkey (Ringo's son), kindling hopes that the \"Children of the Beatles\" might unite.",
      "Asked if they've been offered a gig to play together, Lennon replied, \"Sure. I think people ask for that a lot, but I do think that would be ridiculous. But you know, the reason Zak and James and I made a song together is not because we're trying to redo The Beatles, it's just because we like each other. We're not gonna do it because of some expectation or to, like, fulfill anyone's expectation of what we should do. It has to be natural.\"",
      "Sean Lennon takes his new responsibilities very seriously: \"I think the Beatles' music, and John and Yoko's legacy, is something important for the world to kind of cherish and be reminded of. So, that's how I see my job.\"",
      "Asked how his mother is doing, Lennon said, \"She's good. I mean, you know, she's 92, so she's slowed down a lot, and she's retired. That's why I'm kind of trying to do the work that she used to do. That's why I feel a lot of pressure, actually, to do my best, because she set a high standard for the way that she dealt with my dad's music, and the Beatles stuff. She's always been very singular. And I think my dad was less so. You know, he had Paul to write with, and then he was hoping that my mom would kind of be a writing partner. And I just think it's really funny that, you know, there's probably only one person in the world who would turn down John Lennon as a writing partner, and that's my mom, you know?\"",
      "\"That's probably why he liked her,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, exactly. No, that's exactly right!\" Lennon laughed.",

      "Bowen Yang performed a holiday duet with Ariana Grande for his final act on \"Saturday Night Live,\" as the actor and comedian bid farewell to the sketch comedy show that launched his career.",
      "Yang, 35, had announced his unexpected mid-season departure from \"SNL\" just hours earlier, thanking his colleagues and recapping his tenure on the program in a sentimental Instagram\u00a0post.",
      "\"i loved working at SNL, and most of all i loved the people,\" he wrote in the post. \"i was there at a time when many things in the world started to seem futile, but working at 30 rock taught me the value in showing up anyway when people make it worthwhile.\"",
      "After joining the long-running NBC series as a writer in 2018, Yang began to appear in \"SNL\" sketches over the course of the following season and eventually became part of the main cast in 2021. His promotion marked triumphs for representation on \"SNL\": Yang was the show's first Chinese American cast member and among only several openly LGBTQ comedians ever included in the main cast.",
      "He is now one of its most recognizable faces. Outside of \"SNL,\" Yang hosts the podcast \"Las Culturistas\" alongside fellow actor and comedian Matt Rogers, with whom he also created the spinoff \"Las Culturistas Culture Awards,\" an annual parodied award show that most recently aired on Bravo and Peacock. Yang and Rogers are currently writing and costarring in an untitled new comedy for Searchlight Pictures, according to Deadline.",
      "Yang appeared in the \"Wicked\" movies, which starred Grande, and has amassed a long list of acting credits across television and film. He was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on \"SNL.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"A cappella\" means singing without instruments. But we've come a very long way from monks chanting, to Pentatonix, an a cappella quintet that's won three Grammys and sold 10 million albums. YouTube fans have played their videos more than six billion times.",
      "\"We've just blended together throughout the years just because of how long we've been together,\" said Kirstin Maldonado.",
      "And three of the singers\u2014Maldonado, Scott Hoying and Mitch Grassi\u2014have been together a very long time. \"Mitch and I were in a show together when we were ten,\" said Hoying. \"I met Kirsti in freshman English when we were 14!\"",
      "At their high school in Arlington, Texas, they formed a trio: a soprano, a baritone, and a countertenor. Grassi said of his voice, \"It is incredibly high, and it got made fun of a lot while I was growing up. Yeah, growing up in Texas, you know, it was very different and it's a little feminine, so it was like, 'Get him outta here.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"Our different timbres make such a specific sound when the frequencies of our voices come together, like they all play such a vital role. When they're all together, it feels like this hug. It's really magical, actually.\"",
      "In 2011, they decided to try out for NBC's a cappella competition show \"The Sing-Off.\" But when they learned that bigger groups had better chances, they added a bass, Avi Kaplan, and wanted to add a beatboxer. Hoying said, \"And so, in an act of desperation, we literally went on YouTube and typed in 'beatboxers.' The first video to pop up was a video of Kevin playing cello and beatboxing at the same time.\"",
      "It was Kevin Olusola\u2014cellist, singer, beatboxer, and pre-med student at Yale. Asked what his parents had to say when he quit pre-med to become a musician, Olusola replied, \"It was definitely not the plan!\"",
      "They not only made it onto \"Sing-Off,\" they won the grand prize: $200,000 and a record deal. But within a month, the record company dropped them. Olusola said, \"They asked us, 'Hey, will you guys put any instrumentation behind what you all do?' And we said, 'We literally just won an a cappella TV show.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"We were just like, 'No, we don't like that idea.' And they were like, 'Okay, then we'll drop you.'\"",
      "Instead, they turned to YouTube. Within a year, they had four million subscribers.",
      "\"The video that probably really broke us in terms of the industry would be 'Little Drummer Boy,'\" Olusola said. \"It went to Top 10 of iTunes for four weeks.\"",
      "The higher the Pentatonix star ascended, the harder they worked. Their behind-the-scenes sixth member, co-founder and producer Ben Bram, wrote ever-more spectacular vocal arrangements. Pentatonix released three albums in 2014 alone, and toured for nine months every year.",
      "\"You never got to recharge and be at home, or see your friends or your loved ones,\" said Maldonado. \"It was, like, really, really brutal.\"",
      "So brutal that, in 2017, Avi Kaplan made a stunning announcement: he decided to take a step back from Pentatonix.",
      "\"He didn't really want to tour; he didn't love the tour life,\" said Hoying. \"And we were in our prime and, like, really wanting to tour a lot.\"",
      "After a nationwide search, Pentatonix found its new bass: a Pentatonix superfan from Maryland named Matt Sallee. \"To be able to come into the group and to be able to continue its legacy was something that I cherish very deeply, and I took very seriously,\" Sallee said.",
      "He was prepared: \"I knew everything,\" he said. \"I, like, learned every song, every bass part of every song.\"",
      "\"We were so excited and relieved and grateful that, like, oh, we can see the vision for the future, we can keep this going\" Hoying said.",
      "And they did keep going.",
      "To hear Pentatonix perform \"O Holy Night\" click on the video player below:",
      "I asked, \"You guys have been together\u2014living, traveling, working\u2014for years. You can't tell me there aren't things about each of you that drive others of you crazy?\"",
      "\"Do we have time?\" Sallee replied.",
      "\"There's a lot. There's a lot,\" said Maldonado.",
      "Hoying said, \"We kind of lucked out that none of us are super-reactive.\"",
      "\"I don't think we all have, like, crazy egos that are, like, getting in the way of being able to communicate clearly with each other,\" Maldonado said.",
      "But after 14 years in the spotlight, change was inevitable. Olusola said, \"Everybody's now starting to get married, have kids. So now, what do we want in this stage?\"",
      "What they wanted was to focus on Christmas. Five of their last six albums have all been Christmas music, and their tour is decidedly a holiday show.",
      "And recently, there's been an even bigger change. Their new album, \"Christmas in the City,\" is not a capella! \"I feel like it was time to evolve and do something new,\" said Hoying.",
      "\"Because if you put limits on your artistry, then you won't grow,\" Maldonado added.",
      "But they say they are not abandoning a cappella.",
      "Asked what they think Pentatonix's effect on a cappella has been, Hoying replied, \"I think we've made harmony and singing, I feel like we've been part of what made it cool. There's, like, over 1,200 a cappella groups in colleges now.\"",
      "\"Where before people would either say maybe it's nerdy or, like, not cool or whatever,\" Maldonado said.",

    "summary": "Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz looks back at the work of actor and director Rob Reiner, whose films became part of our shared cinematic language because of their humor, drama, and aching belief in humanity.",
    "story": [
      "In the aftermath of the deaths last weekend of filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz offers an appreciation of Reiner's unparalleled career and life in the movies:",
      "Rob Reiner entered America's collective consciousness in 1971, playing Mike Stivic, Archie Bunker's son-in-law, and politically liberal foil, on \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Mike: \"It's getting like politics in American is only for the rich.\" Archie: \"Who's been feeding you that commie crapola?\" Mike: \"President Eisenhower said that.\" Archie: \"He did not! Eisenhower was a great president who never said nothing.\"",
      "Even then, Reiner knew that, as good as he was in front of the camera, he wanted to direct. His feature debut as a director came in 1984 with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a parody of a documentary that delivered one of the funniest scenes in movie history:",
      "Nigel (Christopher Guest): \"This is very, very special. Because as you can see, the numbers all go to 11. Look, right across the board, 11, 11, 11, 11.\"  Marty: (Reiner): \"And most amps go up to 10?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. \u2026 What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?\"Marty: \"Put it up to 11?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. One louder.\"Marty: \"Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?\"Pause.Nigel: \"These go to 11!\"",
      "\"Spinal Tap\" began an extraordinary run that rivals the best directors in Hollywood history: Seven classic films in just 11 years, each standing the test of time, each possessing some piece of authentic humanity.",
      "In \"Stand By Me,\" an aching moment of friendship between two boys.",
      "In \"The Princess Bride,\" a combination of everlasting love \u2026 and revenge.",
      "Inigo (Mandy Patinkin): \"My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "Three of the movies Reiner made during that run of success contain scenes so perfectly shot, they've become part of our shared cinematic language. First came the diner scene in \"When Harry Met Sally.\" The scene required Meg Ryan to mimic a woman faking an orgasm. After one take, Reiner went to Ryan and explained what he wanted: louder, more hand movements, table pounding. The button on the scene came from Reiner's mother, Estelle: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "Next came Kathy Bates, giving an Oscar-winning performance in \"Misery.\" For the hobbling scene, Reiner gives us James Caan's perspective, tied to the bed, looking up at the benevolent mania of Bates' face.",
      "Finally, in \"A Few Good Men,\" Reiner did the seemingly impossible: directing Jack Nicholson to a performance as memorable as \"Chinatown,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" or \"The Shining.\" Reiner gave us a courtroom drama for the ages, and Nicholson an opportunity to shine in front of a new generation of movie lovers.",
      "Col. Jessup (Jack Nicholson): \"You want answers.\" Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise): \"I think I'm entitled.\" Jessup: \"You want answers?\" Kaffee: \"I want the truth.\" Jessup: \"You can't handle the truth.\"",
      "The truth about Rob Reiner is that, for many Americans, his politics were as well-known as his films, but not always as popular. A fierce critic of President Trump, there's no doubt millions of Americans disagreed (many strongly) with Reiner.",
      "But here's the thing we can all understand about him: Rob Reiner was a patriot, an American who believed deeply in humanity; who believed in trying to make his country work as well as possible for as many human beings as possible.",
      "You can see that aspirational political nature in the last movie of his remarkable run, \"The American President,\" in 1995:",
      "President Shepherd (Michael Douglas): \"You want to claim this land is the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country cannot just be a flag. The symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Now show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free.\"",
      "There is no easy way to process the family tragedy that took Rob and Michele Reiner. It is awful. Period.",
      "The sense of loss is heightened by Rob's lofty standing in Hollywood. In a business that can induce backstabbing and produce enemies, Rob was nearly universally loved in the entertainment industry. I didn't know him as well as I would've liked, but he always made me feel like we'd been pals for decades.",
      "His character was defined by his kindness, his humor, his compassion, by his own humanity.",
      "Those are qualities that all of us love in his movies, films that maybe, in some small way, can help us find something that unites us in these unbelievably fractured times.",

    "summary": "Ted Koppel visits Seneca Falls, the Central New York town that's said to have inspired the 1946 Jimmy Stewart classic \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" a film that celebrates smalltown virtues and happy endings, and which still has a powerful hold on our imagination.",
    "story": [
      "There's a little town in Central New York that our old colleague, Bill Geist visited 14 years ago, when he said, \"On Christmas morning, what better place to be than Seneca Falls, N.Y.? The town loudly and proudly proclaims that it was the inspiration for the Christmas film classic 'It's a Wonderful Life.'\"",
      "And every year they have this festival celebrating the occasion. One visitor told us, \"Been waiting my whole life to come up here and see this. I believed in Santa Claus when I was a kid. And I believed in the movie.\"",
      "The movie's been around for almost 80 years now, but just in case you don't know the plot: Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, this sweetheart of a guy who runs a building and loan association in the town of Bedford Falls, just the soul of decency and kindness and selflessness. And then there's Lionel Barrymore. He's Mr. Potter, who runs the big bank in town, and he is none of those things.",
      "MR. POTTER: \"Are you running a business or a charity ward? Not with my money!\"",
      "In a nutshell, we get to see what the town would have been like if George Bailey hadn't ever existed \u2013 instead of Bedford Falls, we had Pottersville.",
      "It might have been just a little like this: A few weeks back at a Seneca Falls Town Board meeting, a local resident kept talking after debate had been shut down, and a board member, Frank Sinicropi, seemed to offer a drastic solution: \"Shoot him!\"",
      "He was just kidding, but he did tell the police chief to shoot one of the townspeople. Bad timing! After all, this was just a few weeks before all those tourists come pouring into town searching for the annual festival celebrating \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"",
      "Kevin McDonald wasn't born when the movie was made, but he lives and breathes the film's message: \"Especially this time of year,\" he said. \"The spirit. You can't be here and not smile.\"",
      "It's on a bridge just like this one that director Frank Capra brings his hero, George Bailey, to the brink of suicide, until he witnesses someone fall into the water \u2013 an angel who, by keeping George from suicide and getting him to perform a heroic rescue, will earn his wings.",
      "Locals believe it's based on a real rescue in 1917 in Seneca Falls. \"Somebody tried to end their life here,\" said McDonald.",
      "Enter Antonio Varacalli, who was on the shoreline when he saw the woman go into the water, and jumped in to save her. \"Got her to shore, and then he succumbed,\" McDonald said. \"He was an immigrant from Italy. We have a hero's celebration in April to honor him.\"",
      "\"It's kind of ironic, isn't it, in these times with what's happening to immigrants?\" I said.",
      "\"It sure is.\"",
      "But when this reporter visited the local cafe and talked about immigrants today being rounded up and sent overseas, not necessarily back to their own countries, one woman replied, \"You poor thing. You're gonna have a hard time this weekend, because everyone I've met today is gonna focus on the positive.\"",
      "\"Well, that's fine,\" I said. \"I've got no problem with you focusing on the positive; I'm just not gonna make it that easy for you. You're focusing on the positive, and I'm seeing a country that is getting caught up in the negative. You can't ignore that.\"",
      "Another woman, wearing angel wings, said, \"When you come to Seneca Falls, you get it. It's healing, and it's hope. I think that's one of the reasons we're so drawn to this movie, just to give ourselves back to kindness again.\"",
      "It's an inescapable message, even for Jimmy Hawkins and Karolyn Grimes, who played two of the Bailey children, Tommy and Zuzu, in the movie.",
      "Grimes admitted she didn't have many lines in the movie, but people hold onto her most famous one at the end: \"Daddy, Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\"",
      "\"Everywhere she goes, right?\" Hawkins said.",
      "What's more, Grimes said, \"I believe it.\"",
      "\"Oh, do you?\"",
      "\"Oh, I do!\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" I said.",
      "\"Are you a cynic?\" Grimes asked.",
      "\"A cynic?\" I replied. \"I don't think you can be in my line of work for as many years as I have been without becoming a bit of a cynic!\"",
      "Well, for example, amid all that joyful spirit of kindness and civility hanging over Seneca Falls at this time of year, there is also THAT just looming over the edge of town: Seneca Meadows, the largest landfill in the Northeastern United States.",
      "Bill Lutz has a plant that packages bottles and containers for wineries and breweries in the shadow of Seneca Meadows: \"That hill is filled with all kinds of garbage and toxic chemicals and vapors that come off it on a daily basis,\" he said. \"We have a hard time not only retaining employees, but attracting new employees. It's definitely a challenge to try to get people that want to move here. And it certainly affects our business.\"",
      "Not surprisingly, Seneca Meadows told us they are a good neighbor who consistently meets or exceeds safety standards and regulations. In fact, that's part of their argument for why they should be allowed to expand.",
      "Lutz said, \"It was flat land not too many years ago, and now they're moving to an expansion that would take it another 15 years, and another 70 feet higher.\"",
      "Now, isn't that just the kind of thing that would've driven Jimmy Stewart's character, George Bailey, nuts?",
      "GEORGE BAILEY: \"You spin your little web and think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter!",
      "Lutz said, \"They've got plenty of money, lawyers to keep it going. It's a big Texas company, and they want to continue to grow it, because they can do it here, in a small town.\"",
      "In fact, that's what we have downtown: A small town, with a museum about a movie. Well, part of a movie \u2013 maybe not the part about what could happen to the town of Bedford Falls.",
      "\"People want to go back to simpler times,\" said Anwei Law, who created the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" Museum. \"This reminds them of that, and gives them the opportunity to do that for a short period of time.\"",
      "I asked Karolyn Grimes, \"What are we seeing today? Are we seeing a reflection of George Bailey's world? Or Mr. Potter's world?\"",
      "\"Oh, that's awfully touchy!\" she laughed. \"It's trying to be Mr. Potter's world, I think. But I think there's enough George Baileys out there that it's gonna balance their direction.\"",
      "Mr. Potter, a villain in the movie, seems to go unpunished, although Harold Buccholz, a student of the film, sees a greater message: \"We're a little bit surprised when George Bailey has his life back, and he's so excited to be alive again. And as he's running home he stops by the bank, he bangs on the window and says 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!' His arch enemy! And I think if we choose to accept that that's ultimately Capra's challenge to us, is love your enemies, you will be richer, and the community will be richer if you can find a way to do that.\"",
      "It's a picture-perfect Hollywood ending that endures as a message to our better angels, even if reality doesn't always go that way.",
      "\"It depends if you believe,\" said the angel-winged fan of the film. \"We all have a calling.\"",
      "Anwei Law said, \"There's this need for people to come together. And there's this need for people to care about each other and help each other. And this movie prompts that in people because that's within them.\"",
      "\"It's a spotlight on what we could be, on what we can be?\" I said.",
      "\"Exactly. And we all really want to be.\"",
      "\"And want to be. Not necessarily what we are.\"",
      "\"What we are? Yep, yep,\" said Law.",
      "I'll settle for that!",

      "Comedian and actor Albert Brooks said he's still in shock over the death of one of his oldest and best friends, Rob Reiner.",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News in the special \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" that aired Sunday. Brooks and Reiner met at Beverly Hills High School in a drama class 60 years ago.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found fatally stabbed in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14, authorities said. Their son, Nick, has been charged with first-degree murder in their deaths.",
      "Brooks said there are still moments he forgets his friend is gone.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Brooks said he agreed to sit down with CBS News for the special because he loves to talk about his rare friendship with Reiner and his wife.",
      "\"The fact that I'm here makes my heart break ... that we have to do this because of the reason. But by the same token, I love talking about them, because it's genuine and it's rare. And so, I just wish there was no reason to do this,\" he said.",
      "Brooks and Reiner returned to their high school, reminiscing about their time together while surveying the school's Wall of Fame, during an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in December 2023.",
      "\"This is the first time both of us have been back since we graduated,\" said Reiner. Brooks joked: \"Over a certain age, it's against the law. Well, life works best when you remember.\"",
      "As they pointed out a bench they used to sit on, Reiner joked, \"It brings back no memories,\" as Brooks agreed, \"Nothing. Nothing.\"",
      "Reiner directed the HBO documentary, \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" released in 2023. Before that, the pair was only in one movie together, \"The Muse\" in 1999. \"He hired me. He was nice enough to hire me,\" Reiner said. \"I was,\" Brooks replied.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel \u2014 especially under foot \u2014 and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen \u2014 a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled \u2014 a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-sourced sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:06:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "story": [
      "Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.",
      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",
      "The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn't reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as \"environmentally friendly\" and compliant with emissions standards.",
      "The agreement is still subject to court approval.",
      "Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz USA already agreed in 2020 to pay $1.5 billion to the U.S. government and California state regulators to resolve the emissions cheating allegations.",
      "Mercedes-Benz issued a statement saying the deal announced Monday will resolve all remaining legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions in the United States, but the company still considers the accusations unfounded and denies any liability. The automaker has made \"sufficient provisions\" for the cost of the settlement, the statement said.",
      "Fifty attorneys general, including the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, made up the coalition announced Monday. California was not part of the group.",
      "The settlement calls for the automaker to pay the attorneys general $120 million with another $29 million payment suspended and potentially waived pending completion of a consumer relief program.",
      "That effort will extend to the roughly 40,000 vehicles with the devices that hadn't been repaired or permanently removed from the road by Aug. 1, 2023. The owners of those vehicles would get $2,000 per vehicle if they install approved emissions modification software and an extended warranty.",
      "The settlement also calls for Mercedes to comply with reporting requirements and refrain from any further unfair or deceptive marketing or sale of diesel vehicles.",
      "Volkswagen also ended up paying $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case due to emissions cheating.",

    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators on Monday gave the green light to a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval handed drugmaker Novo Nordisk an edge over rival Eli Lilly in the race to market an obesity pill. Lilly's oral drug, orforglipron, is still under review.",
      "Both pills are GLP-1 drugs that work like widely used injectables to mimic a natural hormone that controls appetite and feelings of fullness.",
      "In recent years, Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound have revolutionized obesity treatment globally and in the U.S., where 100 million people have the chronic disease.",
      "The Wegovy pills are expected to be available within weeks, company officials said. Availability of oral pills to treat obesity could expand the booming market for obesity treatments by broadening access and reducing costs, experts said.",
      "About 1 in 8 Americans have used injectable GLP-1 drugs, according to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. But many more have trouble affording the costly shots.",
      "\"There's an entire demographic that can benefit from the pills,\" said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert. \"For me, it's not just about who gets it across the finish line first. It's about having these options available to patients.\"",
      "The Novo Nordisk obesity pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide. That's the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic and in Rybelsus, a lower-dose pill approved to treat diabetes in 2019.",
      "How much weight did people lose?",
      "In a clinical trial, participants who took oral Wegovy lost 13.6% of their total body weight on average over about 15 months, compared with a 2.2% loss if they took a placebo, or dummy pill. That's nearly the same as injectable Wegovy, with an average weight loss of about 15%.",
      "Chris Mertens, 35, a pediatric lung doctor in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, joined the Novo Nordisk trial in 2022 and lost about 40 pounds using the Wegovy pill. The daily medication worked to decrease his appetite and invasive thoughts of food, he said.",
      "\"If there were days where I missed a meal, I almost didn't realize it,\" Mertens said.",
      "Participants in a clinical trial who took the highest dose of Lilly's orforglipron lost 11.2% of their total body weight on average over nearly 17 months, compared with a 2.1% loss in those who took a placebo.",
      "Both pills resulted in less weight loss than the average achieved with Lilly's Zepbound, or tirzepatide, which targets two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, and led to a 21% average weight loss.",
      "All the GLP-1 drugs, oral or injectable, have similar side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.",
      "Both daily pills promise convenience, but the Wegovy pill must be taken with a sip of water in the morning on an empty stomach, with a 30-minute break before eating or drinking.",
      "That's because Novo Nordisk had to design the pill in a way that prevented the drug from being broken down in the stomach before it could be absorbed by the bloodstream. The drugmaker added an ingredient that protects the medication for about 30 minutes in the gut and makes it easier to take effect.",
      "By contrast, Lilly's orforglipron has no dosing restrictions. That drug is being considered under the FDA's new priority voucher program aimed at cutting drug approval times. A decision is expected by spring.",
      "How much will the Wegovy pills cost?",
      "Producing pills is generally cheaper than making drugs delivered via injections, so the cost for the new oral medications could be lower. The Trump administration earlier this year said officials had worked with drugmakers to negotiate lower prices for the GLP-1 drugs, which can cost upwards of $1,000 a month.",
      "The company said the starting dose would be available for $149 per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be available in January.",
      "It's not clear whether daily pills or weekly injections will be preferred by patients. Although some patients dislike needles, others don't seem to mind the weekly injections, obesity experts said. Mertens turned to injectable Zepbound when he regained weight after the end of the Wegovy pill clinical trial.",
      "He said he liked the discipline of the daily pill.",
      "\"It was a little bit of an intentional routine and a reminder of today I'm taking this so that I know my choices are going to be affected for the day,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Angela Fitch, an obesity expert and chief medical officer of knownwell, a health care company, said whatever the format, the biggest benefit will be in making weight-loss medications more widely accessible and affordable.",
      "\"It's all about the price,\" she said. \"Just give me a drug at $100 a month that is relatively effective.\"",

    "summary": "Analysts point to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as driving the year-end surge.",
    "story": [
      "Gold prices soared above $4,400 on Monday to reach a new all-time high, as analysts pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as key drivers of the surge.",
      "The price of the precious metal traded at\u00a0 $4,475 per ounce at 4 p.m. EDT after hitting a high of $4,477 per ounce earlier in the day. The asset has risen more than 70% since the start of this year. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation.",
      "\"The metals trade has been strong all year, and particularly for gold,\" Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, told CBS News. \"As its fundamentals remain intact, gold digested its recent rally to all-time highs quite well.\"",
      "Silver prices were also rallying on Monday, reaching $69 by 4 p.m. EDT. The metal is up 130% since the start of the year.",
      "Both gold and silver are on pace to reach all-time closing highs today, according to analysts. The rally comes amid expectations for a strong finish in the\u00a0stock market, where tech gains have helped boost performance.",
      "What's driving the surge in gold prices?",
      "Investors are moving money into gold due to a swirl of geopolitical factors, analysts note.",
      "Bond yields around the world floated higher at the same time major global currencies like the yen weakened, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at online brokerage platform FxPro, said in a statement. The combination is reviving interest in the so-called \"debasement trade\" \u2014 a strategy of moving money out of fiat currencies in favor of hard assets like gold, he noted.",
      "Other geopolitical risks, including the U.S. blockade of oil supplies from Venezuela and Ukraine's attack on a Russian shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, were also pushing investors toward gold on Monday, Kuptsikevich added.",
      "Softer monetary policy may also be driving the upswing in gold prices this year, with investors more bullish after three consecutive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many on Wall Street expect the central bank to continue to ease monetary policy in 2026, while President Trump is set to nominate a new central bank chief before Fed chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"The latest leg of the rally has been driven by the market pricing in an increasingly gold-friendly 2026 outlook, with lower rates and a potentially softer dollar acting as tailwinds for the bullion,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs, a New York-based investment company.",
      "Central banks in multiple countries are also buying more gold, Yates added, helping drive up the asset's price.",
      "Demand for the precious metal from monetary authorities like the National Bank of Poland has risen in recent months, according to the World Gold Council, a trade association for the gold industry. Central bank gold purchases through October totaled 254 tonnes, a slower pace than the previous three years, the World Gold Council said earlier this month.",
      "Yates said central bank holdings are still far below their historical levels.",
      "What's the forecast for gold in 2026?",
      "Despite investor exuberance this year, the gold rally may not continue its run in 2026, according to Capital Economics. The investment advisor firm predicted in a Monday research note that the price of the precious metal could fall to $3,500 by the end of next year \u2014 and that the drop will act as a drag on silver prices.",
      "\"So goes gold, so goes silver: the end of the speculative boom in the former will also kill off the rally in the latter,\" Capital Economics said in the research note.",
      "Other analysts hold a more optimistic outlook. Yates said he expects lower interest rates and a potentially weak U.S. dollar to help boost the case for hard assets like silver into next year.",
      "\"Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of a broader precious metals rally and remain constructive on both gold and silver,\" he said.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has approved a preliminary agreement for a class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples as they do with heterosexual couples.",
    "story": [
      "Like many young girls, Mara Berton and June Higginbotham both knew from an early age they wanted families and to become mothers. But as lesbians, they were excluded from accessing the same fertility treatment insurance benefits offered to heterosexual peers.",
      "Instead, like many other same-sex couples, Berton and Higginbotham, who live in California, had to pay $45,000 out of pocket to conceive while heterosexual colleagues with the same insurance plan had many of those costs covered.",
      "\"We knew it wasn't right,\" Berton said in an exclusive interview with CalMatters. She joined a class action lawsuit challenging the policy. \"What we're fighting for is about family building and having kids ... It was really important to both of us, I think, that other couples not have to do this.\"",
      "Last week, in a landmark settlement, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California Haywood Gilliam Jr. approved a preliminary agreement for the class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples \u2014 like artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization \u2014 as they do with heterosexual couples. It is the first case requiring a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees. An estimated 2.8 million LGBTQ members will benefit, including 91,000 Californians.",
      "Under the settlement, Aetna will also pay at least $2 million in damages to California-based members who qualify. Those who may be eligible must submit a claim by June 29, 2026.",
      "\"I truly hope that this is the first of many insurers to change their policy,\" said Alison Tanner, senior litigation counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center. \"We were looking at that as an issue of inequality \u2014 that folks who were in same-sex relationships were being treated differently.\"",
      "Roughly 9 million additional Californians will soon have access to mandated fertility benefits under a new law taking effect in January. The law applies to state-regulated plans \u2014 which Aetna is not in this case \u2014 and amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people.",
      "Previously, Aetna's policy required enrollees to engage in six to 12 months of \"unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse\" without conceiving before qualifying for fertility benefits, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women \"without a male partner\" to access benefits only after undergoing six to 12 cycles of artificial insemination unsuccessfully depending on age.",
      "Lawyers argued that the policy fundamentally treated LGBTQ members differently and effectively denied them access to the benefit, which can be prohibitively expensive for many people.",
      "In an email, Aetna spokesperson Phillip Blando said the plan provides infertility benefits in accordance with each member's plan, coverage rules and applicable law.",
      "\"Aetna is committed to equal access to infertility coverage and reproductive health coverage for all its members, and we will continue to strive toward improving access to services for our entire membership,\" Blando said.",
      "Berton, who was the lead plaintiff in the case, said she was blindsided by the policy. She had consulted with a fertility clinic and decided to move forward with donor sperm and artificial insemination, when a representative from Aetna called and said she did not meet the definition of infertility.",
      "She appealed the decision multiple times; she was rejected. The experience felt \"dehumanizing,\" her wife Higginbotham said.",
      "Insurance had dictated Berton attempt 12 rounds of artificial insemination before she would be eligible for benefits. Her doctors recommended no more than four rounds.",
      "Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a policy like that could only be designed to dissuade people from accessing their health benefits. Doctors typically recommend three to four cycles of artificial insemination before IVF, but Tipton said there have also been studies showing it is more efficient and cost effective to go straight to IVF.",
      "In 2023, the society updated its medical definition of infertility to include LGBTQ folks and individuals who don't have partners. They did so in part to stop insurers from denying claims like Berton and Higginbotham's.",
      "\"The driving force was a realization that it takes two kinds of gametes to have kids,\" Tipton said. \"Regardless of the cause of that absence, you have to have access in order to be treated for a fertility issue.\"",
      "Since the definition changed, Tipton said more employers and insurers are covering benefits for LGBTQ folks or single people. They have also leveraged the definition to enact statewide benefits expansions, including California's upcoming fertility benefits mandate.",
      "Berton and Higginbotham said they also worried about running out of donor sperm that matched Higginbotham's Jewish and Native American heritage \u2014 and was limited in supply.",
      "\"I don't feel like your insurance should be involved in those types of decisions and kind of determine your journey,\" Berton said.",
      "The couple pulled together money from family members and decided to proceed even without coverage. After four unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, they moved on to IVF, partially to give themselves the best chance of conceiving with the donor they chose.",
      "The experience was \"all consuming\" and emotionally difficult as Berton endured hormone injections, egg retrievals and a miscarriage. But today, she and Higginbotham have two healthy twin girls whose favorite thing is to play on the swings and \"take every book off of their shelf\" for their mothers to read.",
      "The couple achieved their family dreams before the lawsuit concluded. Even so, Higginbotham said she hopes the settlement will help other LGBTQ couples across the country.",
      "\"I know people that don't have children, that wanted children, because the stuff isn't covered. I know people that their timeline was delayed and maybe they have fewer kids than they wanted,\" Higginbotham said. \"The settlement is such a huge step forward that is really righting a huge wrong.\"",

      "The Interior Department didn't disclose the specific security issues raised by the Defense Department, instead pointing to unclassified federal reports that have found wind projects can create risks because the movement of turbine blades, combined with their reflective towers, can create radar interference.",
      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",
      "Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged\u00a0Trump's Day One order\u00a0that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.",
      "Halted projects",
      "Vineyard Wind 1, located about 15 miles south of the Massachusetts islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, is slated to include 62 wind turbines, each spaced by one nautical mile apart, according to the project's website. About half of those turbines were operational in October, the Vineyard Times reported that month.",
      "Once fully developed, the project is projected to generate renewable energy for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Revolution Wind, a project located off the coast of Rhode Island, is 80% completed, according to its website. It's operated by renewable energy company Orsted, which didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Dominion Energy's CVOW, which stands for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, is the largest offshore wind project in the U.S., with 176 turbines. The project was projected to be up and running by the end of 2026, according to its website.",

    "summary": "The main distillery will be closed for site enhancements, the company said. The pause comes after whiskey production has dropped amid a challenging year.",
    "story": [
      "The maker of Jim Beam bourbon whiskey said it plans to pause production at its main distillery in Kentucky starting Jan. 1.",
      "Jim Beam, which is owned by a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings, said in an email to CBS News that its distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, will temporarily halt production \"while we take the opportunity to invest in site enhancements.\" The company plans to keep its James B. Beam campus open for visitors during that time, the company added.",
      "Jim Beam will continue to distill at its Fred B. Noe craft distillery in Clermont and Booker Noe distillery in Boston, Kentucky.",
      "The pause comes amid several challenges in the wine and spirits industry. Americans overall are drinking less, with Gallup finding that the share of U.S. adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, near a 90-year low.",
      "Exports of U.S.-produced spirits fell 9% in the second quarter, partly due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, according to an October report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. Exports to Canada were particularly hard hit, declining by 85% during the period, after Canadian retailers pulled U.S. spirits from shelves in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs, the group noted.",
      "Through August, whiskey distillers had produced 55 million fewer proof gallons this year than a year ago, a decline of 28%, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A proof gallon is one U.S. gallon of liquid that is 50% proof alcohol.",
      "Whiskey connoisseurs may not have to worry about supplies running low. Kentucky warehouses now hold a record 16.1 million barrels of aging bourbon, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. The total \u2014 reported in October \u2014 marks the highest level since the repeal of Prohibition and reflects a 27% increase from 2024, the group said.",
      "The surge in bourbon supplies is partly due to an increase in the number of distillers located in Kentucky, the group said. But the industry is also witnessing a dip in demand due to uncertainty over tariffs, declining exports and shifts in drinking habits, it added.",
      "Bourbon, a type of whiskey, must adhere to U.S. distilling laws to be labeled as such. For instance, the liquor must be aged in new, charred oak containers and the grain recipe must be at least 51% corn, according to whiskey tourism site Bourbon Country.",

      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin.

Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder to get the Instagrammable selfie in front of one of the world's most celebrated waterworks.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro, or $2.35, fee for tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City's efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome's cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city $7.6 million extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome's Pantheon monument.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro or nearly $6 tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",
      "\"We believe that culture is a fundamental right of citizenship,\" Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference. \"We think it's correct and positive that the citizens of Rome can enjoy our museums free of charge.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",
      "So far this year, around 9 million people have waited in line to get that close-up visit, with some days as many as 70,000 passing through, Gualtieri said. That system now becomes permanent from 9 a.m.-9 p.m., with the fee to be paid by nonresidents. Visitors can either pay in advance online, while waiting in line or by buying tickets at tourist locations around town.",
      "After nightfall, access is open and free.",
      "Pope Urban VIII initially commissioned the fountain in 1640. In 1730, Pope Clement XII revived the project and the current fountain corresponds to the original designs of Roman architect Nicola Salvi.",
      "The towering fountain features at the Titan god flanked by falls cascading down the travertine rocks into a shallow turquoise pool, where Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg famously took their nighttime dip in \"La Dolce Vita.\"",
      "While bathing is prohibited nowadays, legend has it that visitors who toss a coin over their shoulders and make a wish will return to Rome.",
      "European officials have sought to curb overtourism amid protests from residents who say large amounts of visitors are making cities difficult to live in. Last year, Venice became the first city to\u00a0impose a tax for day-tripping tourists. A spate of viral incidents, including a woman who scaled the Trevi Fountain to\u00a0fill up her water bottle\u00a0and a British man who\u00a0carved his and his girlfriends' initials\u00a0into the Colosseum, also drew attention to the issue.",
      "\"These tourists are also vandals, because they have no respect for our cultural heritage, which belongs not just to Italy, but to the whole world,\" said Daniela Santanch\u00e8, Italy's tourism minister, at the time. \"We've introduced a bill with a very simple concept: You break it, you pay for it.\"",

    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",
      "\"Medicaid has prices that are much higher than what other European nations pay,\" a senior administration official said. \"Americans should not pay more than other developed nations.\"",
      "But injectable drugs and infusion medications will not be available on TrumpRx because the White House has concluded these drugs must be administered by health care providers and should not be on a direct-to-consumer platform.",

      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, cooler than economists had forecast and a sign that price pressures may be easing.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, providing a snapshot of price changes on everyday items such as food and apparel.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices rose 2.6% on an annual basis in November, down from 3.1% in September.",
      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",
      "Data collection was disrupted due to the government shutdown, which delayed the September and November CPI reports. The Labor Department on Thursday said it didn't collect October data due to the shutdown, but said it was able to retroactively acquire some non-survey data for the month.",
      "What economists are saying",
      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told\u00a0CNBC on Friday that data distortions likely pushed the CPI reading down by \"probably a tenth or so.\"",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "summary": "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits over allegations of poor care.",
    "story": [
      "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits alleging hundreds of patient injuries and deaths, encouraging those pursuing millions in damages.",
      "Genesis HealthCare, once the nation's largest nursing home chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in July with a proposal to protect its controlling investor, Joel Landau, from legal liability. In court papers, Genesis had originally estimated all its settled and pending cases \u2014 which it said numbered nearly a thousand \u2014 would cost $259 million to resolve.",
      "KFF Health News reported this month that in the years before filing for bankruptcy, Genesis had settled at least 155 patient injury and death lawsuits with provisions that allowed it to delay paying, sometimes for more than a year. As a result, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy in July, it still owed $41 million out of the $58 million promised in those settlements with families of current or former residents, according to the bankruptcy and case records KFF Health News reviewed.",
      "In hearings Wednesday and last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey G.C. Jernigan said she would not approve a sale of the company's assets that included legal releases from liability for Landau and a private equity associate, David Gefner. Landau, who was seeking to purchase the assets through another company he controlled, did not attend the bankruptcy hearings or respond to a subpoena, lawyers said in court.",
      "\"I'm very encouraged that someone is watching and paying attention to this,\" said Erin Pearson, whose father, James Sanderson, died in 2018 after spending less than a month in a Genesis facility in Albuquerque. \"And the guy who owns the most shares, not only did he not show up but doesn't just get to move things around and rebuy\" the nursing homes.",
      "According to Pearson's lawsuit, filed in 2019, Sanderson developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis while at the facility but was not sent to the hospital for more than a week.",
      "Genesis did not pay Pearson the $500,000 it agreed to in a settlement, according to Pearson's claim filed in bankruptcy court. \"I don't know if I'll ever see that settlement, but I would like to be hopeful,\" Pearson said in an interview Dec. 17.",
      "Genesis, Landau, Gefner, and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a public statement last week, David Harrington, the executive chairman of Genesis' board of directors, praised Landau and his company's investment in Genesis for helping it avoid bankruptcy in 2021. That \"lifeline,\" he said, enabled Genesis to transform into a \"nimble, market-based model dedicated to prioritizing resident and patient care.\"",
      "Ian Norris, who represents 19 clients with lawsuits against Genesis \u2014 including four who have not been paid their settlements \u2014 said the judge's ruling was \"a huge win for all those who were confronting the possibility that they would not be able to recover the settlements that were promised to them by Genesis prior to the bankruptcy.\"",
      "According to Genesis' bankruptcy filings, the company owes more than $1.6 billion in unpaid claims that are not secured by liens, including claims not only from former residents and their families but also from a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; and Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia, which are owed provider taxes. Daniel Simon, a lawyer representing Genesis' owners, said in court on Dec. 17 that $155 million would be available from the proceeds of the sale for these creditors under a bid for the nursing home assets from a new company controlled by Landau and Gefner.",
      "Genesis last month held an auction for its assets and announced that Landau's bid was the best, but the U.S. Trustee's Office and creditors objected, saying Genesis had unfairly excluded one group from bidding and downplayed the value of another group's bid that would have provided more money to creditors. Jernigan said there were too many irregularities in the auction for her to approve it and ordered it be redone under the watch of the U.S. Trustee's Office.",
      "\"I am aware that there is huge concern about Mr. Landau, and he is not here,\" Jernigan said last week. \"There is no way I can approve these releases without him on the witness stand and me being convinced of his good faith.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who along with two Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief questioning the fairness of the auction, said in a media statement: \"A private equity company tried to abuse the bankruptcy system to slither out of paying what they owe to neglected seniors in its nursing homes. This is a textbook case of why we need to get private equity out of health care altogether, and this decision is a good step forward in the fight to deliver relief for the victims of Genesis.\"",
      "In the Dec. 17 hearing, representatives of the company controlled by Landau and Gefner said they would bid again for the remains of Genesis without the promise of liability releases. The auction is expected to occur in January. Simon, the lawyer for Genesis, said at the hearing that the judge's ruling \"has humbled us.\"",
      "Lawyers for former and current Genesis residents said they hope to sue Landau and other parties that controlled the company and led it into bankruptcy. John Anthony, a Tampa attorney who represents 341 claimants, said, \"The victims believe that Mr. Landau richly deserves his day in court, so he can explain to a jury of his peers how he has apparently gotten so rich running all these supposedly insolvent facilities into the ground.\"",

      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",
      "DraftKings said its app, which is expected to be available in major app stores within days, will connect with multiple exchanges, starting with the derivatives marketplace CME Group.",
      "Once they have a DraftKings account, users can enter the DraftKings Predictions app and start trading by clicking on the yes/no questions associated with an event, such as an NFL game, and deciding how much money they want to wager.",
      "More specifically, users originate the trades, while DraftKings acts as a broker, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, the general manager of DraftKings Predictions, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're handling that order and it's getting sent to an exchange for it to be executed,\" she explained.",

      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports. Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, recently called out Kalshi on\u00a0social media\u00a0after the company filed forms to accept bets on the transfer decisions and status of student-athletes, saying it would threaten \"competition integrity and recruiting processes.\"",

      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",

Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS.

      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",

      "\"As he announced to the nation last night, thanks to President Trump's unwavering commitment to our warriors and the provisions provided in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, more than 1.45 million service members will, in the coming days, receive a one-time tax-free bonus of $1,776,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The checks will be tax-free because they are being paid as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement, The Hill\u00a0reported. The IRS\u00a0says\u00a0that such housing payments are considered a military benefit and are excluded from taxable income.",
      "Who gets a $1,776 check?",

      "Active duty officers with an O-6 pay grade and two years of experience or less earn $8,340.90 a month, according to 2025 military pay charts. O-1 officers with the same amount of experience earn $3,998.40 monthly.",

      "\"It's the end of the year and my employees are expecting some kind of raise, but I don't know how much I can give them because I don't know what kind of impact the tariffs are going to continue to have on me,\" Modlin told CBS News.",

      "U.S. importers currently face an average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Small business importers paid roughly $25,000 more per month on average due to the Trump administration's tariffs between April and September, compared to the same period in 2024, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy research institute.",
      "\"What should be a season of giving has become a season of paying for America's 36 million small businesses,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said at a press conference on Tuesday held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \"They are paying more for affordable health care, more for electricity and more for just about everything, thanks to Trump's tariffs.\"",

      "Who's to blame?",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship blamed small businesses' challenges on Democrats.",
      "\"Four years of Democrat control of Washington created a historic affordability crisis for small businesses as inflation soared and an unprecedented $1.8 trillion in new regulations were created,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. \"In just 11 months, Republicans have begun to undo the damage by passing the largest tax cut in history to complement the $907 billion regulatory rollback being undertaken by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The results speak for themselves as we just witnessed a record number of holiday shoppers, core inflation fell to the lowest level in five years, and hardworking Americans' real wages will increase by $1,000,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Spokespersons for the White House and Small Business Administration didn't respond to a request for comment on the affordability concerns cited by some small businesses.",
      "Another major concern for Modlin and her workers is that enhanced tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, which experts have said would sharply drive up premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "An October CAP\u00a0analysis found that 4.4 million small business owners and self-employed Americans will see their health insurance costs rise by an average of $1,500 if the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "In 2024, Modlin offered employees a $350 monthly stipend to help offset health plan costs. Now, she said she's trying to decide whether to increase that monthly payment or offer raises. She can't afford to do both, said Modlin, expressing concern about losing some of her machinists to larger competitors.",
      "\"I've interviewed job candidates who have said they need a better health insurance benefit,\" she said. \"The rest of our benefits are good, but I just can't keep up with the cost of insurance.\"",
      "Julie Robbins, CEO of Earthquaker Devices, an Akron, Ohio-based maker of guitar pedals and other musical effects products, said the 35-person company's costs have soared about 30% this year because of the sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "She and her husband, with whom she runs the business, purchase thousands of components sourced from more than a dozen countries to manufacture pedals in Ohio. The company has paid an additional $60,000 in tariffs this year, a figure that could rise to at least $180,000 in 2026, Robbins said at the Senate small business event held earlier this week.",
      "Robbins said Earthquaker plans to modestly hike its prices starting in January, noting that the company's suppliers have lifted their own prices. She acknowledges that such increases could scare away some customers.",
      "\"You can't calculate how demand will suffer from a price rise, so we try to avoid that whenever possible,\" Robbins told CBS News.",

      "Growth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.",
      "\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "Another tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.",
      "Still, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.",
      "Is my money safe?",
      "The biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.",
      "AI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with\u00a0earnings growth\u00a0from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.",
      "\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.",
      "Amid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.",
      "In its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.",
      "Crisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped. The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.",
      "\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"",
      "Still, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.",
      "\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 11:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Instacart's AI-driven pricing technology has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which is now probing the company over its use of the tool, according to\u00a0Reuters.",
      "\"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,\" \u00a0the FTC said in a statement. \"But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",
      "Most feel it's at least somewhat difficult to afford the things they're buying for the holidays. Some are pulling back on gifts, entertainment and travel, particularly those among the majority who say items cost more now than they did last year.",
      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",
      "In all, the season often brings feelings of gratitude and happiness, but finances can factor into sentiments, too: those who say it is hard to afford things are more apt to say the season also brings stress.",
      "With holiday travel coming, many do feel they're getting relief on gas prices. More say they are going down more than going up \u2014 the first time we've seen that this year.",
      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",
      "The people who are keeping purchases steady or buying more this year tend to be those who say their financial situation is good.",
      "Feelings about the holiday season",
      "Overall, the holiday season evokes more positive feelings than negative ones, with many saying they are happy and grateful.",
      "But those who are having difficulty affording holiday expenses are especially likely to report feeling stressed, too.",
      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",

    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board told its shareholders that Paramount Skydance's offer \"provides inadequate value\" for the business.",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on December 5 to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on December 8 with an all-cash offer for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that its bid, combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News), would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "Paramount is offering $30 a share for the entire company, while Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's stock traded on Wednesday at $28.30 a share.",
      "Paramount Skydance on Wednesday said that it is sticking with its $30 per share offer, expressing confidence that the bid offers \"superior value\" to Netflix's bid.",
      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department has disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department began disclosing\u00a0thousands of files and photos\u00a0related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, with additional batches released in subsequent days, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors for more transparency into the government's investigations into the disgraced financier.",
      "The records were released in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed last month and required the government to release virtually all Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said more files will be released \"over the next couple of weeks,\" even though the law required the documents to be disclosed by Friday. He later told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed more time to pore through the records and redact victims' names.",
      "Congressional Democrats have accused the Justice Department of failing to comply with the law, arguing the documents are too heavily redacted and should have been released in full on Friday.",
      "Where to find the Epstein files",
      "The files that were disclosed Friday under the Epstein Files Transparency Act are available on the Justice Department's website, broken into different data sets. Many of the files are photos, not text documents.",
      "CBS News is also uploading the records to a searchable database, which is available here.",
      "Here are the Justice Department's records:",

      "Data Set 6",
      "Data Set 7",
      "Data Set 8",
      "What's in the new Epstein files?",
      "Thousands of the files are images, including photos that were seemingly taken in Epstein's mansion in Manhattan or his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those include photos of his bedroom in New York, his risque wall art and a taxidermied tiger.",
      "Many photos show Epstein socializing with his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also appears in several of the images \u2014 in some cases, the former president is posing with celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Clinton traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but says he was not aware of Epstein's crimes, and accused the Justice Department of trying to scapegoat Clinton on Friday.",
      "Some of the photos are redacted \u2014 in certain cases, they show Epstein posing with people whose faces are obscured.",
      "There are also a number of investigative documents, some of which have heavy redactions. In a few cases, documents are almost entirely redacted.",
      "Why were some of the Epstein files redacted?",
      "The law that requires the Justice Department to release the files only allows redactions under narrow circumstances, including to take out Epstein survivors' personal information, violent images or child sexual abuse material. The government is also allowed to temporarily withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Records cannot be withheld solely because they would cause \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"",
      "Some redactions in the documents released Friday appeared to omit victims' names, but the exact reasons for every redaction are unclear. The law also requires the department to give Congress a list of its redactions within 15 days.",
      "What was Epstein investigated for and charged with?",
      "The files that were released Friday are expected to stem from the litany of investigations surrounding Epstein and Maxwell, stretching back at least 20 years.",
      "Allegations about Epstein's conduct appeared to emerge on the government's radar as early as the 1990s, when survivor Maria Farmer says she reported to the FBI that Epstein had abused her. In a lawsuit, she has accused the government of failing to look into her allegations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by local police in Florida and federal prosecutors starting in the mid-2000s. That probe ended with a controversial 2007 deal in which federal prosecutors in Miami agreed not to charge him, in exchange for a guilty plea on prostitution charges in state court.",
      "More than a decade later, Epstein was charged in New York federal court with abusing and trafficking dozens of underage girls. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking conspiracy the following year, and was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "Files from several other probes could be made public. The government has investigated the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019, officially ruled a suicide. And it has investigated Miami prosecutors' decision to cut a non-prosecution deal.",
      "Why the Epstein files are being released now",
      "The files are being released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in November. The legislation gave the attorney general 30 days to publicly release documents related to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the government's investigations into both and internal records about the cases.",
      "The legislation was the result of years of pressure from Epstein and Maxwell's survivors, who pushed lawmakers for more transparency about how the government handled both of their cases. Epstein's death fueled conspiracy theories about his connections to high-powered figures in government and the business world.",
      "The calls for transparency reached new heights over the summer. The Justice Department conducted a review of the Epstein files in the government's possession, and concluded that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he had blackmailed prominent figures. The findings infuriated many of the president's supporters who had been calling for the release of the Epstein files for years, and opened the door for a bipartisan push to unveil the records.",
      "California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, was the lead sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He introduced the bill in July, and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky filed a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on the measure. The push was delayed by opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the government shutdown in the fall. But in November, the petition received the final signature required to bring the bill up for a vote.",
      "It passed the House by a vote of 427 to 1 and the Senate unanimously approved it. President Trump signed it into law on Nov. 19, despite spending months pressuring Republicans to oppose it, starting the clock on the 30-day deadline.",
      "In the wake of Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, three separate judges approved Justice Department requests to unseal grand jury transcripts from investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. One of those rulings stemmed from grand jury proceedings in South Florida in 2005 and 2007. Epstein ultimately escaped federal charges there and instead agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.",
      "The other two court orders came from judges in New York, where Epstein and Maxwell were charged in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
      "When will the next group of Epstein files be released?",
      "It's unclear. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News earlier Friday that the department would release more files \"over the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "\"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected \u2014 is completely protected,\" Blanche said.",
      "That timeline does not comply with the law, which required the release of all eligible files by Dec. 19. The department's office of public affairs said before Friday's release that the \"initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"",
      "Blanche's comments, and the department's failure to release all of the files, angered many Democrats who have harshly criticized the administration for its handling of the documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of violating the law and suggested they could take legal action.",
      "\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin and Garcia said in a joint statement. \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena. The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\"",
      "Raskin and Garcia said they are \"examining all legal options\" given Blanche's earlier admission.",
      "\"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ,\" they said.",

    "summary": "ICE has filed more than 8,000 requests to toss out asylum claims in immigration court, asking judges to send immigrants to third-party countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has mounted a nationwide campaign to void the asylum claims of thousands of immigrants with active cases in immigration court by arguing that they can be deported to countries that are not their own, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "The effort appears to have intensified in recent weeks, targeting asylum-seekers with pending cases in immigration courts in Atlanta, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas and elsewhere across the U.S., multiple immigration lawyers and certified legal representatives told CBS News.",
      "Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch. Instead, they are administrative entities run by the Justice Department, which employs and oversees the judges that adjudicate the cases of people facing deportation. Lawyers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement represent the government in the proceedings.",
      "The administration's new tactic involves ICE attorneys asking the immigration judges to toss out asylum claims without hearing them on the merits. In these requests, known as \"pretermit\" motions, ICE argues that asylum-seekers fearing persecution in their home countries can instead be deported to one of several nations the Trump administration has persuaded to accept deportees who are not their citizens.",
      "As part of the effort, ICE attorneys have asked immigration judges to order asylum-seekers deported to third countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News and interviews with immigration lawyers. If granted, those petitions nullify asylum-seekers' claims and clear the way for them to be deported to third countries, absent any appeals.",
      "Previously undisclosed internal government data obtained by CBS News indicates that, as of early December, ICE attorneys had filed more than 8,000 motions in immigration court to toss out asylum claims by citing deportation agreements with third countries.",
      "The campaign is the latest move by President Trump to sharply curtail access to the American asylum system, which his administration has argued is being systematically abused by migrants who came to the U.S. for economic reasons, especially those who entered illegally along the southern border under the Biden administration.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration is \"working to get illegal aliens out of our country as quickly as possible while ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,\" the department added, citing \"lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strategy rests on a section of immigration law that disqualifies migrants from asylum if the applicant is eligible to request legal protection in another nation that has agreed to a \"safe third country\" arrangement with the U.S.",
      "In late October, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which reviews decisions by immigration courts, issued a ruling that lawyers believe will turbocharge efforts by the government to use \"safe third country\" agreements to cancel asylum cases. That order directed immigration judges to decide the motions by ICE to send immigrants to third-party countries before reviewing their asylum applications. It also placed the burden on asylum-seekers to prove they should not be sent to a third country because of fears of being persecuted there.",
      "\"You just have to give up\"",
      "While the Trump administration has argued its latest effort is meant to curb asylum fraud, multiple immigration lawyers told CBS News the campaign has affected clients with strong asylum claims who fled persecution in countries like Iran, Nicaragua and Russia.",
      "The attorneys argued the government's campaign is designed to eliminate the path to asylum in the U.S. Some said it is meant to coerce asylum-seekers into withdrawing their claims, by scaring them with the prospect of being deported to a country that is not their own.",
      "\"They see the asylum system as a whole as a problem, because it impedes them from deporting people in a quick manner,\" said Pa\u00fal Pirela, an immigration lawyer in Houston.",
      "\"If you want to apply for asylum, we're forcing you to apply in a country that you've never been to,\" Pirela continued. \"You just have to give up and go back to your country or go somewhere else,\" he added later.",
      "Pirela said one of his clients, a Nicaraguan asylum-seeker and political dissident, was ordered deported to Honduras after the government filed a pretermit motion in his case. ICE, he added, is also trying to get another client, an asylum applicant from Guatemala, ordered deported to Honduras.",
      "Atlanta immigration attorney Adriana Heffley got notice that DHS had motioned to pretermit her client's case and deport him to Uganda four days before a hearing, she told CBS News. Her client is from Iran, and was apprehended at the border when he entered the U.S. illegally last December, she said. He has been detained ever since.",
      "Heffley and her client had prepared a case arguing that he would face persecution and danger in Iran as someone who had previously been in same-sex relationships. But they had to switch gears and quickly prove he would also suffer in Uganda. The judge agreed and denied the DHS motion to preempt the case.",
      "\"Immigrants who are coming up on a hearing that will determine the course of the rest of their lives and their fate and their safety are being hit with this left-field motion just a day or two before that final hearing,\" Heffley said.",
      "New York immigration attorney David Treyster is not confident his case will see the same outcome. DHS moved to deport his client, a Russian national, and her 4-year-old child, to Uganda, he told CBS News. The judge initially planned to give Treyster 30 minutes to confer with her before hearing opposing arguments and ruling on the motion. After pleading with the judge, Treyster was able to schedule the hearing for Tuesday.",
      "The judge \"seemed to imply that her hands are being tied,\" he said, given the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling that the third-country deportations must be considered first. \"We haven't even had our hearing, [but] the judge kept saying, 'you're going to have to appeal this.'\"",
      "\"The person timely and properly applied for asylum and is in line waiting their turn, doing everything that the administration wants people to do, reporting to their court hearings, filing all their papers on time, and here we are just taking that due process away from them,\" Treyster added.",
      "Some immigration attorneys are challenging the tactic in court, including the 2019 regulation that ICE attorneys have been citing in their motions arguing that asylum-seekers can be deported to third countries.",
      "\"I think that this is in line with this administration's attempt to completely eviscerate the availability of asylum and other forms of protection in this country,\" said Blaine Bookey, legal director for San Francisco's Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, one of the groups litigating the case. \"This is, in their view, an easy way to cut off a case at the knees.\"",

      "\"This movie will rise and fall on love, not fights,\" Stallone said. \"Everyone can sort of go, oh my God, it's the little things in life, it's the love, it's the nurturing \u2014 that's the victory.\"",
      "Stallone calls the movie his biography when at the time he felt like he couldn't win. He went into acting in his 20s after growing up with his father, who Stallone said was emotionally and physically abusive. Movies were a way for Stallone to cope, and he said the mythic heroes he saw on screen changed his life.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to be that guy,'\" Stallone said. \"I don't want to be what's at the house, but I do want to be this noble creature.\"",

    "story": [
      "George Conway, a conservative lawyer turned vocal critic of President Trump, filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission   Monday for a bid to represent New York City in the House.",
      "The attorney who was once offered a job in the first Trump administration and was previously married to former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway became a prominent critic of Mr. Trump, and co-founded The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump super PAC, in 2019.",
      "Conway's rebukes of the president helped him build an online following as his frequent criticism\u00a0that came as his wife served as counselor to the president, spurring interest throughout Washington. The president once called Conway \"a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell.\"",
      "Conway, 62, enters a crowded race to succeed Rep. Jerrold Nadler in New York's 12th Congressional District. The district, which includes Manhattan's Upper East Side, Upper West Side and Midtown neighborhoods, is deeply Democratic and one of the nation's wealthiest districts.",
      "At least nine people are already vying for the Democratic nomination, including Jack Schlossberg, the only grandson of the late President John F. Kennedy, March for Our Lives co-founder Cameron Kasky and New York Assemblyman Micah Lasher, a protege of Nadler's.",
      "Nadler, 78, was first elected to represent New York in the House in 1992 and went on to chair the powerful House Judiciary Committee. He announced in September that he wouldn't seek reelection, citing a need for generational change in the Democratic Party.",
      "Days ago, Conway said on his podcast that he was leaving the show to do \"either the stupidest thing I've ever done, or the best thing. We'll see.\" He wrote Monday about the coming midterm elections on Substack, saying the House has become \"a kneeling gallery\" to the president, while warning that \"a handful of seats is all that stands between democracy and a president who answers to no one.\"",
      "\"We need Democrats to take over Congress \u2014 and not just any Democrats, but the most fearless and relentless ones,\" Conway wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department is facing continued backlash over its partial releases of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with lawmakers and survivors denouncing the limited scope of the disclosures.",
      "The Trump administration faced a Dec. 19 deadline to release most of the government's records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law last month. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the files will be released on a rolling basis over the coming weeks due to the volume of the materials and the need to shield the personal information of survivors.",
      "A first tranche of records was made public Friday, followed by a second batch Saturday. Many of the documents contained significant redactions, including whole pages of records that were blacked out.",
      "Early Tuesday, the department released tens of thousands of additional documents from the files. It wasn't immediately clear what impact that release would have on the criticism of the earlier releases.",
      "The Justice Department also removed more than a dozen of the earlier files without an initial explanation. The department said on X on Saturday that files would continue to be \"reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the removed files was an image of a group of framed photos, including two that appeared to show Mr. Trump. The department said on Sunday that the file was \"temporarily removed\" out of an abundance of caution after federal prosecutors in New York flagged it \"for potential further action to protect victims.\" The department reposted the photo after it said a review determined that \"there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph.\" Mr. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein.",
      "A group of survivors of abuse by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate who was convicted of sex trafficking, called on Congress to hold hearings and take legal action to demand compliance with the law. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "\"It is alarming that the United States Department of Justice, the very agency tasked with upholding the law, has violated the law, both by withholding massive quantities of documents, and by failing to redact survivor identities,\" they said in a statement Monday.",
      "The survivors said the government released \"a fraction of the files,\" and said the material that was disclosed was \"riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution Monday that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes in the new year.",
      "Schumer called the Justice Department's rollout a \"blatant cover-up,\" claiming Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche \"are shielding Donald Trump from accountability, and the Senate has a duty to act.\"",
      "\"The law Congress passed is crystal clear: release the Epstein files in full so Americans can see the truth,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "Bondi said in a post on X on Sunday\u00a0that the Justice Department \"will bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims,\" and urged any survivors with information to come forward.",
      "But in July, the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that a review of the government's files related to Epstein \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna expressed dissatisfaction with the release on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday. Khanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, authored the Epstein legislation and worked together on the discharge petition to force a vote on the measure.",
      "Massie said he and Khanna are \"talking about and drafting\" a resolution to hold Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress, which he called \"the quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims.\"",
      "Inherent contempt is a rarely used tool that Congress can use to enforce compliance with its directives. A 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service called it a \"long dormant\" power that allows lawmakers \"to detain and imprison a contemnor until the individual complies with congressional demands.\" The report noted that while there \"may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines\" as an alternative, there's no precedent for Congress imposing a fine for contempt.",
      "Last year, a push by GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida to hold then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in inherent contempt fell short in the House. Though she had initially signaled that she was pursuing a resolution to hold Garland in custody, the final measure would have imposed a fine of $10,000 per day on Garland for defying a congressional subpoena.",
      "Khanna said he and Massie are \"building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.\" To force a vote on the House floor upon the chamber's return next month, the resolution would likely be offered as a privileged motion, which would require leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general had 30 days from its enactment to make public \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" in the Justice Department's possession that related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The law prohibited the government from withholding, delaying or redacting records \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" But it did allow the attorney general to redact certain portions of documents, including personally identifiable information of survivors or depictions of child sexual abuse.",
      "The law also requires the Justice Department to provide written justification for any redactions to Congress.",
      "The president, asked about the Epstein documents at an event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Monday, voiced frustration that there is still so much attention focused on them.",
      "\"I believe they gave over 100,000 pages of documents,\" he said. \"And there is tremendous backlash, it's an interesting question, because a lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they're in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin a reputation of somebody. So a lot of people are very angry that this continues.\"",
      "Epstein was under investigation in South Florida in the early 2000s, but ultimately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Miami to escape federal charges. He agreed to instead plead guilty to state prostitution charges and serve 18 months in prison.",
      "He was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019 and died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility weeks later.",

President Trump has argued that boat strikes have been effective at quelling drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, but critics have questioned the president's legal authority to carry out the strikes.",
      "Monday's strike targeted a vessel in international waters that was \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes,\" the U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X. The military said the boat was operated by a designated terrorist organization \u2014 it did not specify the organization, but the Trump administration has categorized several Latin American drug cartels as terror groups.",
      "The military called the target of Monday's operation a \"low-profile vessel.\" Narcotics trafficking groups have\u00a0long been accused of using submarines and semi-submersible \"low-profile\" boats to transport drugs in certain cases. In October, Mr. Trump announced a strike against an alleged drug-trafficking submarine in the Caribbean, killing two people and leaving two survivors who were repatriated to their home countries.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Monday that the release of thousands of photos from the government's files on Jeffrey Epstein risked ensnaring \"highly respected\" people with no connection to the late sex offender's crimes, in the president's first public remarks since the files were released last week.",
      "The congressionally mandated releases brought to light images of former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, among others. Epstein was known for cultivating relationships with the rich and powerful, and he socialized with both Clinton and Mr. Trump at various points \u2014 though neither man has been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "Asked Monday what he thought about the emergence of photos of Clinton, Mr. Trump called it \"terrible\" and said he's \"always gotten along\" with the former president \u2014 and argued other people who appear in the photos could be unfairly tarred.",
      "\"I don't like the pictures of Bill Clinton being shown. I don't like the pictures of other people being shown. I think it's a terrible thing,\" the president told reporters. \"I think Bill Clinton's a big boy, he can handle it. But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago ... and they're highly respected bankers and lawyers and others.\"",
      "The president said Epstein was \"all over Palm Beach\" and many people crossed paths with him.",
      "\"A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein, but they're in a picture with him because he was at a party, and you ruin a reputation of somebody,\" Mr. Trump said Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "The Justice Department began releasing records on Epstein on Friday, a deadline set by Congress last month in the bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act that was signed by Mr. Trump. The department has said it plans to release more files \"on a rolling basis\" over the next few weeks, despite the law's Dec. 19 deadline, citing the need to redact victims' names and other information from documents.",
      "The files include decades' worth of material from the federal government's investigations into Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, but died by suicide in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted of trafficking. Epstein was also investigated by federal prosecutors in the 2000s, but in a controversial move, he avoided federal charges in exchange for a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in Florida.",
      "Mr. Trump encouraged GOP members to vote for the law after deriding Republicans who pushed for more information on the government's Epstein investigations, calling Democrats' fixation on the issue a \"hoax\" and arguing Democrats were using it as a distraction.",
      "The president's reservations about the issue appeared to still linger on Monday.",
      "\"I hate to see photos come out of [Clinton], but this is what the Democrats, mostly Democrats, and a couple of bad Republicans are asking for,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to the four House Republicans who joined with Democrats in forcing a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.",
      "Mr. Trump ran in some of the same social circles as Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, but the two had a falling out. The White House has said in the past\u00a0that the president kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago for acting like a \"creep.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled with Epstein on multiple occasions, but added he never went to Epstein's island. Clinton has said he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes. On Monday, Clinton spokesperson Angel Ure\u00f1a called on the government to release all additional photographs or records that include the former president, arguing he has nothing to hide.",
      "\"[W]hat the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why,\" Ure\u00f1a said in a statement. \"But we do know this: We need no such protection.\"",

Boasberg determined that the men were in the legal custody of the U.S. during the months they spent detained at CECOT, and that they should've been given a chance to challenge the Trump administration's allegations that they were gang members.",
      "\"On the merits, the Court concludes that this class was denied their due-process rights and will thus require the Government to facilitate their ability to obtain such hearing. Our law requires no less,\" Boasberg wrote in his opinion Monday.",
      "The group of 137 men who could benefit from the ruling is a subset of more than 200 Venezuelan deportees sent to CECOT in March, some of whom were deported to El Salvador under traditional immigration procedures. All of the Venezuelan men held at CECOT were released this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap.",
      "Boasberg said the U.S. government could comply with his order by allowing the men to return to the U.S. or otherwise offering them a hearing. The administration, he wrote, could \"theoretically offer Plaintiffs a hearing without returning them to the United States so long as such hearing satisfied the requirements of due process.\"",
      "Boasberg gave the government until Jan. 5 to file a plan to comply with his order.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the men ceased to be in U.S. custody after they were sent to El Salvador, so U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction to hear legal claims challenging their detention. But Boasberg wrote that the U.S. effectively maintained control over the men because El Salvador held them in prison at the U.S.'s behest, and the administration paid for them to be detained at CECOT.",
      "The first group of Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were deported on March 15, soon after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act and declared alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang enemies of the state who could be detained and deported with little to no due process.",
      "At the time, Trump administration officials called the deportees dangerous criminals, terrorists and gangsters.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT on March 15. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",
      "A report released last month by human rights groups determined that the treatment of the Venezuelan deportees imprisoned at CECOT amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse.",

    "summary": "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S. this month.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is still pursuing a sanctioned oil tanker in international waters, a U.S. official told CBS News on Monday, as the Trump administration appeared to intensify its targeting of oil vessels amid a pressure campaign directed at the Venezuelan government.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker, called the Bella 1, over the weekend, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official said.",
      "But the ship \u2014 which had not yet entered Venezuelan waters \u2014 refused to be boarded and sailed away, fleeing toward the Caribbean. An active pursuit began, with the vessel sending distress signals to nearby ships. That pursuit remained underway as of Monday afternoon, according to the official.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Sunday the pursuit involved \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion.\"",
      "\"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said.",
      "The Coast Guard's pursuit of the tanker was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters did not give a specific location for the operation or the name of the vessel being pursued.",
      "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S.\u00a0this month.",
      "In a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries. A U.S. official told CBS News that the interdiction of the vessel followed a similar playbook to an earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
      "And earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0called The Skipper that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the tanker seized on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",
      "\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" he added. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"",
      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is pushing for more information on a White House ballroom project championed by President Trump, sending a series of letters Monday to the project's architect and some attendees of a fundraising dinner.",
      "The White House disclosed a partial list of those who attended the October 15 dinner, which was held to recognize financial contributors to the $400 million ballroom project. CBS News obtained a more complete list of invitees through sources.",
      "Blumenthal\u00a0asked several reported attendees who weren't on the official list\u00a0how they decided whether to donate and how much to give. He also asks if they were given the option to stay off the White House-released list, and if so, why they chose to remain anonymous.",
      "David Baszucki, the CEO of game company Roblox, did not appear on the White House list, but did attend the dinner. Blumenthal asks Baszucki to confirm in writing that he donated $5 million to back the ballroom, an amount not previously reported. The senator writes that Baszucki told him about the donation during a meeting.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson said Baszucki donated to the non-profit organization supporting the ballroom project in his personal capacity \u2014 but declined to specify the amount.",
      "Blumenthal also sent letters to Trish Duggan, a wealthy Republican donor; Robert Goldstein, CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp.; Carey Smith, Parsons Corp. CEO; Dan Gilbert, Rocket Companies Chairman; Steve Rudder; Cliff Sims, a former White House official; John Solomon, Just The News editor-in-chief; TV personality Greta Van Susteren and her husband; and Geoff Verhoff, a lobbyist.",
      "Not all of the fundraising dinner's attendees have confirmed that they donated.",
      "\"Many of the donors have deep financial, business, or other personal interests before the Administration,\" Blumenthal wrote, arguing that Americans are entitled to \"all the relevant facts about who is funding the most substantial construction project at the White House in recent history.\"",
      "Roblox has faced criticism for insufficient child protections on its platform, and members of Congress have taken note. It also faces a wave of state lawsuits accusing the company of exposing minors to potentially harmful content. Tennessee sued Roblox as recently as last week.",
      "Since the October dinner, the company announced new child safety measures. Roblox has said it dedicates \"substantial resources\" to finding and taking down inappropriate content.",
      "Democrats lack subpoena power in Congress, so Blumenthal's asks amount to a request rather than a binding demand.",
      "Blumenthal also wrote to the architect who took over the ballroom project after tensions between Mr. Trump and the original architect became public.",
      "Shalom Baranes, a D.C.-based architect, was hired in early December. So far the White House has declined to share details about its financial arrangement with the firm.",
      "Blumenthal's letter asks for Baranes to provide details about how he became involved in the project, whether there is a contract between Baranes and the government and if he has shared design plans.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 19:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Animal rights groups celebrate, but the Trump administration is light on specifics about phasing out federally funded medical testing on animals.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. said this weekend that he is working across the government to end all federally funded animal testing.",
      "\"All the major agency heads are committed to ending animal experimentation,\" he said in an interview with Lara Trump\u00a0on Fox News, referring to research being conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy focused specifically on monkey testing, or \"non-human primate testing,\" during his remarks. There are over 100,000 monkeys in primate testing labs around the country, with more than 20,000 more being imported every year, he said.",
      "\"We are trying to put an end to that,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Earlier this year, a CBS News investigation with the South Carolina Post & Courier documented efforts to cancel nearly $28 million in federal grants for research that relied on animals. And it found that, as federal health agencies moved to phase out research on live primates, available alternatives were not yet ready for use.",
      "It was against this backdrop that scientists at the CDC were ordered last month to phase out all their monkey research, a directive first reported in the journal Science.",
      "\"Across the Trump Administration, there is a shift to prioritize animal welfare,\" a health department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"At HHS, that includes moves to reduce unnecessary animal testing requirements and prioritizing human-based research.\"",
      "Primate testing has been an integral part of medical advancement for nearly a century, and federal regulations require that most pharmaceuticals be tested on primates before they enter human clinical studies. Experiments on monkeys are credited with major medical advancements leading to the creation of Tylenol, the COVID-19 vaccine and Ozempic, among other things.",
      "Experiments on primates make up a small portion of biomedical research overall, but Deborah Fuller, director of the NIH-funded Washington National Primate Research Center, said they are essential for developing therapies that continue to save lives.",
      "\"The majority of the biomedical interventions that we have today went through a non-human primate at some point,\" she said. \"Shutting down a non-human primate research program, you're actually shooting yourself in the foot.\"",
      "For example, 200 primates are part of CDC's ongoing research into treatments for HIV and other infectious diseases. Non-human primates are the only animals that closely model HIV infection in humans, according to Fuller.",
      "\"It is a very small slice of all of the animal research that's done. And it is only done because that is the only model that can effectively answer the question that's being addressed,\" she said.",
      "But animal rights groups, who have found allies in the Trump administration, say this type of testing is outdated.",
      "\"I think it's baseless fear-mongering to suggest we need to torture animals to improve human health. All of the available evidence suggests otherwise,\" said Justin Goodman, senior vice president of advocacy and public policy at White Coat Waste Project. The organization",
      "advocates to end all federally funded animal testing and works closely with the Trump administration to cut grant programs that rely on it.",
      "Kennedy's pledge was \"unprecedented,\" Goodman said.",
      "\"As the head of the agency that funds more animal testing than anyone else in the world, RFK's commitment to ending testing on primates and other animals is game-changing,\" he said. \"We are optimistic \u2014 but the devil is in the details.\"",
      "The details for how the federal government intends to actually end animal testing remain sparse. The fate of monkeys already in labs across the country is also unclear.",
      "Kennedy said his agency is exploring options to retire animals to sanctuaries. But there are limited facilities equipped to take in the thousands of primates that may need continued medical monitoring. The estimated cost of transporting the animals alone could cost millions of dollars, even if there were available space for the animals in question.",
      "\"We need to make sure we have space somewhere that can take care of these animals for the rest of their lives,\" said Sally Thompson-Iritani, an associate professor at the University of Washington, who helps oversee the university's animal care program. \"And we currently don't have an infrastructure that supports that.\"",
      "\"I think there's legitimately logistical issues that have to be sorted out, which is why we are anxious to hear more details from HHS about what its plans are,\" Goodman agreed, calling such an effort \"a massive undertaking.\"",
      "Moreover, some animals that have been infected with dangerous diseases like Ebola would not be able to move to a sanctuary and would likely need to be euthanized, Goodman said.",
      "Kennedy has pushed for alternatives to animal testing, suggesting that AI and computer generated models are more accurate and efficient methods for predicting health outcomes in humans. The FDA and NiH put out updated guidelines advocating for the phasing out of live animal models in favor of alternative technologies this spring.",
      "But researchers on the cutting edge of these alternatives don't believe that the new technologies are ready to completely replace primate models.",
      "\"I want to see us get out of the business of using animals in research,\" said Paul Locke in an interview with CBS News over the summer. Locke is an environmental health lawyer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and serves on the board of the school's Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing.",
      "\"The question is when. When can we do that and reach the double goal of having better science and virtually no animals? The answer is not tomorrow.\"",

      "\"There's never been anything like these ships,\" the president continued. \"These have been under design consideration for a long time. And it started with me in my first term, because I said, 'Why aren't we doing battleships like we used to?'\"",
      "The president said the U.S. is \"desperately in need of ships\" because some of the United States' ships \"have gotten old and tired and obsolete.\" The Trump administration is trying to address U.S. shipbuilding shortfalls through multiple administrations, and beef up the United States' shipbuilding supply chain.",
      "The Navy's Phelan said the president has long talked about the need for battleships, and Phelan said that in speaking with other Naval leaders, he agrees.",
      "\"The future Trump-class battleship, the U.S.S. Defiant, will be the largest, deadliest, and most versatile, and best-looking warship anywhere on the world's oceans,\" Phelan said, thanking Mr. Trump for this \"game-changing capability for the United States' Navy.\"",
      "Phelan described the Trump-class battleship as an updated version of the Iowa-class battleship, calling this a \"generational investment.\"",
      "\"Now, this new battleship will command everything from warships to drones and everything in between,\" Phelan said. \"We're going to make battle groups great again, and this is just one piece of the president's Golden Fleet that we're going to build with the investments he talked about.\"",
      "Asked if the ships are being built to counter China, the president said, \"It's a counter to everybody. It's not China. We get along great with China.\" The president said, hopefully, the U.S. never needs to use them.",
      "Mr. Trump said the ships should take about two-and-a-half years to build.",
      "Phelan announced plans last week to build a new class of warship as a part of the president's \"Golden Fleet.\" In a video he posted Friday to social media, Phelan said the goal for the new Frigate class is to have American-designed ships made by Americans, with an eye on 2028 for launching the first ship.",
      "\"We're done admiring the problem. Our focus is on readiness,\" Phelan said in the video.",
      "The president's announcement Monday comes as the Trump administration has built up the United States' increased naval presence in Latin America amid tensions with Venezuela. The U.S. on Saturday announced the seizure of a second vessel in international waters, this one most recently docked off the coast of Venezuela, after the president announced a \"blockade\" of all oil tankers coming in or out of the country.",
      "During his announcement Monday, the president brought up his administration's strikes on alleged drug boats.",
      "\"And soon, we'll be starting the same program on land,\" he said. \"The land is much easier.\"",
      "The administration has also pressured the Venezuelan government in recent weeks, accusing it of working with drug cartels \u2014 which it denies. The president said Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro can do \"whatever he wants,\" but gave a warning.",
      "\"We have a massive armada formed, the biggest we've ever had, and by far the biggest we've ever had in South America,\" Mr. Trump said. But he also said if Maduro \"plays tough, it'll be the last time he's ever able to play tough.\"",

      "Copenhagen, Denmark \u2014 Denmark said Monday it would summon the U.S. ambassador after President Trump appointed a special envoy to Greenland, the Danish autonomous territory he has often expressed interest in obtaining.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January 2025, Mr. Trump has said the U.S. needs the resource-rich island for security reasons and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland.",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Monday he was \"deeply angered\" by the move and warned Washington to respect Denmark's sovereignty.",
      "In a post on social media platform Sunday night, Mr. Trump said Landry \"understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.\"",
      "Landry responded directly to Mr. Trump on social media, saying, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"",
      "The Danish foreign minister told television TV2 the Landry appointment and statements by Mr. Trump and Landry were \"totally unacceptable\" and said his ministry would call in the U.S. ambassador in coming days \"to get an explanation.\"",
      "\"As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty,\" he said.",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen meanwhile said the appointment \"doesn't change anything for us here at home.\"",
      "\"We will determine our future ourselves. Greenland is our country,\" he wrote on social media, adding: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.\"",
      "The vast majority of Greenland's 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark but don't wish to become part of the U.S, according to a January opinion poll.",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly insisted that the huge Arctic island isn't for sale and that it will decide its future itself.",
      "\"The appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland,\" Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement emailed to AFP.",
      "\"However, we insist that everyone -- including the U.S. -- must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",

      "\"We need Greenland for national security,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"We have to have it.\"",
      "Greenland's location, minerals put it in focus",
      "Greenland is strategically located between North America and Europe at a time of rising U.S., Chinese and Russian interest in the Arctic, where sea lanes have opened up because of climate change.",
      "Greenland's location also puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the United States.",

    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March \u2014 will remain free on supervised release until at least the end of the year, after a Maryland judge on Monday extended her order barring the government from detaining and deporting him again.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from federal immigration custody earlier this month. At a hearing on Monday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis extended a temporary restraining order from earlier this month that prohibits the Trump administration from again taking Abrego Garcia into custody as she considers how to rule next in the case.",
      "Xinis ordered the Justice Department to inform her by Dec. 26 on what the Trump administration's definitive plans are for how it intends to move forward with moving to deport Abrego Garcia. The Salvadoran national's attorneys will have until Dec. 30 to respond to the government's position. At least until then, Abrego Garcia will remain with his family in Maryland.",
      "In Monday's hearing, Xinis pushed Justice Department attorney Ernesto Molina on what specific steps the administration plans to take on Abrego Garcia, whom the Trump administration has indicated it plans to deport. Until she gets specifics, she suggested she is not going to allow the Trump administration to detain him.",
      "\"Why should I give the respondents the benefit of the doubt?\" she asked, referring to the Trump administration.",
      "Molina said he needed to talk to representatives at the Department of Homeland Security before giving her an answer.",
      "\"I need something to say, 'okay, they're not just going to pick Mr. Abrego Garcia up without lawful authority,'\" Xinis said to Molina. \"That's a real question. He was deported without lawful authority, he was detained without lawful authority.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has been in legal limbo for months. The Maryland resident, who first came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011, was deported to El Salvador and held in a supermax prison, despite a 2019 immigration court order barring him from being sent to his home country and an order from Xinis to fly him back. The Trump administration described his deportation as an \"administrative error.\" He was ultimately brought back to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges.",
      "He was then held in pre-trial detention in Tennessee, released after two months, and then re-arrested days later and held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention while the government seeks to deport him a second time. He was released from federal custody earlier this month, after Xinis found that he had been detained unlawfully.",
      "Abrego Garcia appeared in-person in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, for the first time since he was released from ICE custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys said they are deciding how to handle his ongoing immigration case, as he simultaneously faces a looming criminal prosecution on charges of alleged human smuggling in Tennessee in January. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty and has moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that the prosecution is selective and vindictive.",
      "\"If the government were to say today, we're going to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica,\" one of Abrego Garcia's attorneys Jonathan Cooper said, his client is prepared to go \"as soon as this afternoon.\"",
      "Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, another of Abrego Garcia's attorneys, said that his client is \"literally in a double bind in which he has two ankle bracelets on him,\" barring him from self-deporting.",

      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",

      "Halted projects",
      "Vineyard Wind 1, located about 15 miles south of the Massachusetts islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, is slated to include 62 wind turbines, each spaced by one nautical mile apart, according to the project's website. About half of those turbines were operational in October, the Vineyard Times reported that month.",

      "Dominion Energy's CVOW, which stands for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, is the largest offshore wind project in the U.S., with 176 turbines. The project was projected to be up and running by the end of 2026, according to its website.",

    "summary": "Rifts over the direction of the conservative movement emerged during Turning Point USA's conference, as speakers attacked each other by name.",
    "story": [
      "Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest highlighted a rift in the conservative movement that's emerged since the assassination of the group's co-founder, Charlie Kirk, in September.",
      "Over the course of the four-day conference, some of the speakers criticized one another by name. Podcaster and prominent right-wing personality Ben Shapiro called out Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and Megyn Kelly and accused them of being \"frauds and grifters\" and for entertaining far-right conspiracy theories following Kirk's killing.",
      "\"The conservative movement is in danger from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty,\" Shapiro said during his remarks Thursday night. He referred to Bannon as \"a PR flack for Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "One fault line that's emerged is how to handle the rise of far-right antisemitic and white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes after Carlson recently interviewed him on his podcast. Many conservatives were outraged at Carlson for giving Fuentes a platform, though some have defended him.",
      "At AmericaFest, Shapiro went after Carlson for hosting Fuentes \u2014 whom he called \"a Hitler apologist, Nazi-loving, anti-American piece of refuse\" \u2014 on his podcast.",
      "Bannon, in his remarks, compared Shapiro to \"a cancer\" on the conservative movement.",
      "\"Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,\" Bannon said. \"Mark my word, he will make a move on Turning Point, because he's always been envious of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "The event was the first of its kind since Kirk was assassinated in September while speaking at a Utah university. The noticeable rift between speakers made some of the attendees uneasy.",
      "Deacon Jones, a 19-year-old Turning Point USA member from Tennessee, has attended two of the conservative group's conferences in the past, and he said this weekend's AmericaFest felt noticeably different compared to previous years after Kirk's death. Jones suggested Kirk's absence seemed to make a palpable difference.",
      "\"I I think Charlie used to be the beacon that everybody could trust; he would take everybody's ideas and kind of boil it down to something that everybody could agree with,\" Jones said. \"I think everybody's just trying to figure out, like, 'Where do we go from here? How do we figure out who to listen to, who to trust?'\"",
      "Jones was one of the more than 25,000 people who attended the conference, which took place in Phoenix, Arizona, and included prominent conservatives such as Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Bannon, White House border czar Tom Homan, Carlson and a surprise appearance by rapper Nicki Minaj. President Trump called in to the conference by phone..",
      "Lucas Beaver, a 19-year-old Turning Point USA chapter president from North Carolina, told CBS News on Sunday that Fuentes is \"trying to grab the attention\" of the young conservatives.",
      "\"He tries to manipulate things, and in some ways, trying to hide his radicalism, in some ways, so that he can gain those people's trust,\" he said.",
      "Jones added that recent infighting is preventing the young conservative movement from finding common ground it needs to build on its momentum from 2024.",
      "\"We're making major issues minor and minor issues major. We're not talking about all the things we agree on. We're talking about all the things we're disagreeing on and splitting our party,\" Jones said.",
      "Andrew Kolvet, Turning Point's spokesman and executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said no single figure can help resolve MAGA's internal conflict in the vacuum left by Kirk's death, adding that \"it's going to be a team effort.\" But he was hopeful about the more positive direction from Vance, who addressed the conference on Sunday, its final day.",
      "\"With JD Vance's final address, the capstone of this event. It kind of felt like, you know, Dad's home,\" Kolvet said. \"He's telling the kids to settle down. You know, here's what we stand for, here's the Northern Star, and this is what we're chasing after.\"",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security has tripled its \"exit bonus\" offered to undocumented migrants who voluntarily leave the United States by Dec. 31, 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has tripled its \"exit bonus\" for undocumented migrants who voluntarily depart the United States through self-deportation, increasing the financial incentive from $1,000 to $3,000 for those who register with the U.S. government and depart the country by the end of the calendar year.",
      "DHS says all qualified participants who leave by Dec. 31, 2025, will also receive free airfare to their home countries and be waived of certain civil fines or penalties tied to remaining illegally in the U.S., if they voluntarily self-deport using the rebranded CBP Home app. The smartphone app is modeled off the Biden administration's CBP One platform.",
      "Under the Trump administration's policy, migrants are instructed to use the platform to signal their intent to depart. If determined to be eligible, DHS officials say they will receive travel assistance plus the $3,000 paid stipend once the U.S. government confirms the individual has left the country.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says that those who do not take advantage of the temporary incentive will be \"found,\" \"arrested\" and \"never return\" to the U.S.",
      "The CBP One app was originally built under the previous administration to schedule asylum appointments, but under the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda, it has been remodeled under a voluntary departure framework to permit those without lawful status to track their exit.",
      "DHS says the bonus stipend is part of a holiday season campaign aimed at accelerating removals and reducing taxpayer costs, with travel support typically considered less expensive than traditional detention and deportation operations. As of May 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated the average cost to arrest, detain and remove an undocumented migrant is approximately $17,000.",
      "As part of the self-deportation program, DHS says participants are deprioritized for ICE arrest and detention so long as they demonstrate \"meaningful strides\" toward leaving the U.S., though officials have not released detailed guidance explaining how long that protection lasts or how any compliance is judged.",
      "While ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrests nationwide are largely considered the most visible arm of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, the president has simultaneously pushed to compel self-deportation of families and unaccompanied children who entered the country without permission.",
      "In October, the U.S. government announced plans to grant migrant teenagers a $2,500 stipend if they choose to return to their home countries voluntarily, CBS News previously reported.",
      "DHS says that since January 2025, 1.9 million undocumented immigrants have \"voluntarily self-deported,\" with \"tens of thousands\" doing so through the CBP Home program specifically. Those figures have not been independently verified by CBS News, and DHS has not publicly released a detailed breakdown showing how many individuals received government-funded travel or stipends versus those who departed on their own.",
      "According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.",

    "summary": "The episode has deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department's much-anticipated document release.",
    "story": [
      "At least 15 files that were released by the Justice Department Friday in relation to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were no longer available on the department's website on Saturday, CBS News has determined.",
      "CBS News downloaded the complete set of documents on Friday and compared it to what is available Saturday.",
      "It was unclear why the files are missing. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "In a social media post to its X account Saturday night that seemed to touch on the issue, the DOJ wrote: \"Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the missing files showed a mass of framed photos on a credenza desk. The photos showed former President Bill Clinton, and another was of the pope. In an open drawer, there was a photo of President Trump, Epstein, and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "On Sunday, the Justice Department said the Southern District of New York had flagged the image of the framed photos for potential further action to protect victims and it had been put back online.",
      "\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review,\" the Justice Department said in a statement. \"After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"",
      "Other missing files included photos of a room with what appeared to be a massage table and nude photos and nude paintings.",
      "The episode has deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department's much-anticipated document release. The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein's crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions.",
      "Some of the most consequential records expected about Epstein are nowhere to be found in the Justice Department's initial disclosures, which span tens of thousands of pages.",
      "Missing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions \u2014 records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge.",
      "The records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain's former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability",
      "Among the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department's decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children.",
      "The releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein's homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians.",
      "There was a series of never-before-seen photos of Clinton but fleetingly few of Mr. Trump. Both have been associated with Epstein, but both have since disowned those friendships. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him.",
      "Despite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring survivors' names and other identifying information. The department has not given any notice when more records might arrive.",

    "summary": "Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said Sunday that President Trump's idea to give Americans $2,000 checks funded by tariff revenue will \"depend on what happens with Congress.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said Sunday that President Trump's idea to give Americans $2,000 checks funded by tariff revenue will \"depend on what happens with Congress.\"",
      "\"I would expect that in the new year, the president will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Since July, Mr. Trump has floated a possible rebate for some Americans based on tariff revenue. And last month, the president posted on social media that a \"dividend of at least $2,000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News last month that the checks would likely go to households making less than $100,000. He said at the time it remained \"in discussion.\"",
      "Hassett noted that Congress would have to approve the funds, which would likely be issued through the tax code and require lawmakers to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks. But Hassett touted \"a lot of positive news about the economy\" since July that he suggested makes the checks more possible.",
      "\"We've had a couple of quarters of almost 4% growth, we've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row, the deficit relative to last year is down by $600 billion,\" Hassett said. \"And so, in the summer, I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that. But now I'm pretty sure that there is.\"",
      "Hassett said the funds could come from tariff revenue, while noting that \"in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those money. That's an appropriation.\"",
      "The comments come as the president has defended the tariffs as one of his administration's signature policies, touting the approach for helping the U.S. raise new revenue and driving investment in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Hassett said most of the tariffs put in place this year \"have proven their mettle,\" pointing to high growth, reduction in the trade deficit and lower imports from China.",
      "\"So there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space,\" Hassett said. \"But there are also things that we're hearing, when we talk to people like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S., there are also things that maybe could be adjusted.\"",
      "Hassett said \"there's an appetite to exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S.,\" because of factors like climate. He said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is leading that effort.",
      "The top White House economic adviser also expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will side with the administration as the justices consider whether the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under a federal emergency powers law. The administration has relied on the law to impose duties on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "\"We really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us,\" Hassett said.",

    "summary": "More see Trump's policies responsible for economy today than Biden's; there are also concerns about AI impact on jobs.",
    "story": [
      "As 2025 wraps up, it's another in a string of years after the 2020 pandemic in which most Americans consistently voiced negative views about the economy amid ongoing concerns about costs \u2014 a topic that looks poised to dominate 2026, too.",
      "That's because in the eyes of many Americans today, the U.S. is an expensive place to live. Relatively few describe basics like food and housing today as easy to afford, while housing and health care, in particular, are described by more as \"difficult\" to afford than easy.",
      "Against that backdrop, persuading the wider public that things are improved \u2014 as President Trump aimed to do this past week \u2014 sets up a challenge for him going into 2026.",
      "Expectations aren't that high for the impact of his policies to make them better off in 2026, and many don't think that happened in 2025.",
      "Fewer than one in five say Mr. Trump's policies made them financially better in 2025. Outlook on that for 2026 is better by comparison, but still isn't widespread.",
      "And it still pales compared to 2025's expectations. Just ahead of him being sworn in, more expected Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off.",
      "Either way, in the public mind, it is more Mr. Trump's economy than Joe Biden's.",
      "Adding to his challenges: the Americans who give the economy bad grades are even more likely to hold him responsible.",
      "That's maybe partly about what he's done \u2014 people who oppose new tariffs, for example, are especially likely to call it his economy \u2014 but also what they think he hasn't done.\u00a0Those who feel he hasn't put enough focus on lowering prices are even more likely to say this economy is his alone.",
      "The president did halt a months-long steady decline in his handling of the economy and inflation. Each is still low, but now up from the lows of this term recorded in November. His overall approval saw the same dynamic, back up one point.",
      "Most still feel he describes things as better than they really are. That hasn't changed.",
      "On balance, Americans mostly grade the economy as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse.",
      "But plenty of people say their views of the president's job performance could change in the new year \u2014 that he could do something to change their minds. That includes a quarter of those who disapprove of Mr. Trump's performance now.",
      "Most of them say that it would have to do with the economy.",
      "All interviewing for this poll was done following the address to the nation on Wednesday night.",
      "Trump\u00a0 drew plenty of support in 2024 from voters in middle-income ranges, but today two-thirds of Americans say he favors the wealthy, not the middle class \u2014 and that number is higher than it was this spring.",
      "Meanwhile, a range of issues swirl ahead of 2026 that could impact people's bottom lines next year. These include the rise of AI, the impact of deportation efforts (including on jobs), and health care policy, which is looming large.",
      "AI",
      "When looking at a range of different aspects of the U.S. economy, Americans tend to be most optimistic about the technology sector. (more than housing or manufacturing, for instance).",
      "At the same time, there's a lot of skepticism about AI's impact, even as it drives the stock market and investments at ever-higher rates in one of the year's biggest economic stories.",
      "A majority think AI will decrease American jobs, not increase them.",
      "On balance, people would have government policy restrict, not promote, AI.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "The deportation program continues to divide the country, and it is also connected in the public mind to an impact on the economy and jobs. A sizable number \u2014 especially those who approve of it \u2014 believe jobs that were done by those being deported will now be done by citizens or legal immigrants.",
      "Most who disapprove of the deportation program think those jobs will go unfilled.",
      "Most continue to say border crossings are down this year. It's one reason the president's approval ratings on handling immigration has been higher than his ratings for handling the economy this year.",
      "Health care",
      "Most Americans would like to see the ACA tax credits extended, including more than four in 10 Republicans.",
      "A big majority think the administration's policies are making health insurance costs go up.",
      "Heading into his latest announcement of a recent deal with drug makers, the public was not convinced yet of the president's approach to lowering drug prices \u2014 more think he's making costs go up than down.",
      "On the international front",
      "People don't expect Mr. Trump's policies to have any more impact on peace and stability than they perceived in 2025, and a large majority still says Mr. Trump needs to explain what's going on with Venezuela.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,300 U.S. adults interviewed between December 17-19, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), established in 1960 as a federally funded research and education hub in Boulder, Colorado, will be broken up, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said on social media.",
      "Any of its operations deemed \"vital,\" such as weather research, will be moved \"to another entity or location,\" he said.",
      "\"This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,\" Vought said.",
      "The National Science Foundation will be breaking up the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country. A comprehensive review is underway & any vital activities such as weather\u2026",
      "The plan was first\u00a0reported\u00a0by USA Today. It said moves to dismantle NCAR will begin immediately.",
      "Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished NCAR scholar,\u00a0told The Washington Post breaking up the laboratory would result in a major loss of scientific research.",
      "Trenberth, an honorary academic in physics at New Zealand's University of Auckland, said the center was crucial to the search for advanced climate science discoveries.",
      "Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which oversees NCAR, told the Post that, \"Any plans to dismantle NSF NCAR would set back our nation's ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to severe weather and other natural disasters.\"",
      "The White House noted that NCAR's budget\u00a0more than doubled\u00a0from the 1980s to the 1990s and called it \"the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy,\" pointing to examples of its research on wind turbines and air pollution.",
      "Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement on Tuesday that he hadn't been briefed on the plans by White House officials, but said, \"If true, public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.\"",
      "He said part of the NCAR's work provides data on severe weather events \"that help our country save lives and property, and prevent devastation for families.\"",

    "summary": "NASA is gearing up to send four Artemis astronauts on looping test flight around the moon in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Four astronauts in training to fly around the moon early next year strapped into their Orion spacecraft this weekend for a dress rehearsal countdown in a major milestone toward launch.",
      "Based on repeated stops and starts seen on NASA's countdown clock, the complex test originally planned for late November, ran into problems at various points on Saturday. NASA provided no details, but Artemis 2 commander Reid Wiseman said that overall, the test went well.",
      "\"Extremely successful day in our spacecraft #Integrity,\" Wiseman said in a post on X. \"Did everything go perfectly? Absolutely not. But this vehicle and our team showed us they're up to the challenge. Launch is getting very close.\"",
      "Launch is tentatively targeted for early February, but the schedule is extremely tight and the flight may slip to early March. No decisions are expected until after the first of next year.",
      "In any case, Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, wearing bright orange pressure suits, strapped into their Orion capsule using the same procedures they'll follow on launch day.",
      "Such \"countdown demonstration tests\" have traditionally taken place shortly before launch with the rocket and crew ship already on the launch pad. But for Saturday's test, the astronauts boarded their spacecraft atop NASA's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Over the course of the exercise, the astronauts and the launch control team worked through the same countdown procedures they will follow on launch day, ending less than a minute before the clocks would normally hit zero.",
      "Five launch opportunities are available in February when the moon and Earth are in the proper relative positions. The first such opportunity comes on Feb. 6. To make that date, the SLS rocket and Orion would have to be rolled from the assembly building to pad 39B in mid January, setting the stage for a critical fueling test that must go well before NASA can proceed to launch.",
      "Given the amount of work remaining to complete preparations, sources say NASA may opt to delay the flight to early March.",
      "Whenever it takes off, the flight plan calls for the Orion and its crew to spend 25 hours in an elliptical orbit around Earth to test spacecraft life support, propulsion and navigation systems.",
      "The crew plans to fly in close proximity to the SLS rocket's upper stage to test the Orion's maneuvering systems and rendezvous procedures that will be needed for eventual moon landing missions.",
      "An uncrewed Orion carried out a similar loop around the moon during the Artemis 1 mission in November 2022. But the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft was not equipped with a full life support system and it did not carry out thruster firings like those needed for a rendezvous.",
      "Once the testing is complete, the Artemis 2 Orion will leave Earth orbit on a \"free return\" trajectory that will carry the crew around the moon and back to a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The ship will not go into orbit around the moon.",
      "But Artemis 2 will still be the first piloted trip back to the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, carrying Wiseman and his crewmates farther from Earth than any other humans have ever traveled.",
      "The flight will set the stage for Artemis 3, carrying yet-to-be-named astronauts to the surface of the moon near the lunar south pole, NASA hopes, in 2028.",
      "The Artemis 3 flight originally was planned for 2024, a target set during the first Trump administration. But the mission has been repeatedly delayed by processing problems, slowdowns during the COVID pandemic, Super Heavy-Starship testing and work to develop the lunar lander, known by NASA as the Human Landing System, or HLS.",
      "The current 2028 target was set in the past few weeks when it became apparent the space agency would not be ready in time for the most recent previous target of 2027.",
      "China also plans to land its own \"taikonauts\" on the moon by 2030, creating a new space race of sorts, one that NASA vows to win.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:21:27 -0500",
    "summary": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus is the first person with a significant physical handicap to reach space.",
    "story": [
      "In a space-age milestone, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a wheelchair-using engineer and handicap advocate to the edge of space Saturday, a 10-minute trip that allowed her to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness more than 65 miles above Earth.",
      "Michaela Benthaus, a German aerospace engineer who suffered a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident, joined a retired SpaceX manager and four entrepreneurs for the up-and-down flight to a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space.",
      "\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing, joking about turning upside down in weightlessness. \"I didn't only like the view and the microgravity, but I also liked the going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"",
      "Benthaus was assisted during training and inside the Blue Origin capsule by Hans Koenigsmann, a former SpaceX manager and engineer who was instrumental in the development of that company's workhorse Falcon family of rockets.",
      "A fellow German by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen, Koenigsmann helped arrange Benthaus' flight after meeting her last year.",
      "\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Benthaus said in a Blue Origin interview. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?",
      "\"Then he reached out to Blue Origin and told me oh, Blue actually is very excited about it. Okay, I have my doubts on it, but let's see. Thankfully it turned out we can do it. So Hans and me (ended) up flying as a team,\" Benthaus continued.",
      "Koenigsmann said Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time.\"",
      "Benthaus was able to make her own way from her wheelchair into the New Shepard capsule before launch, scooting along a bench extending from the hatch that was provided by Blue Origin. Koenigsmann was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.",
      "Running two days late because of last-minute technical issues, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero Saturday and the New Shepard blasted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch pad at 9:15 a.m. EST.",
      "Accelerating straight up into a mostly clear sky, the capsule's single-stage booster reached a velocity of nearly three times the speed of sound before its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "At that point, the New Shepard capsule was released to continue coasting upward on its own, and the crew, now weightless, was free to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin.",
      "Benthaus' legs were strapped together to keep them in place, but she, too, was free to enjoy the thrill of weightlessness as the New Shepard coasted up to a peak altitude of slightly more than 65 miles, well above the 62-mile-high point where aerodynamic forces no longer have any effect.",
      "At that altitude, the \"sky\" is deep black and Earth's horizon is sharply curved. Passengers are able to take in the view through the largest windows ever flown in space.",
      "\"Oh, my God,\" one passenger could be heard exclaiming over the capsule's radio.",
      "\"Incredible,\" another said.",
      "Falling back into the lower atmosphere, the crew was warned to get back in their seats to strap in before the onset of atmospheric deceleration. Maximum deceleration subjects New Shepard crews to about five times the normal pull of gravity.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, followed a similar trajectory, falling tail first back toward the launch site. Nearing the ground, the BE-3 engine re-ignited, landing legs deployed and the rocket settled to an on-target touchdown on a concrete pad near the launch gantry.",
      "The New Shepard came down under three large parachutes, landing in a cloud of dust near the booster and its launch pad. Blue Origin support personnel quickly reached the spacecraft to help the crew exit.",
      "Joining Benthaus and Koenigsmann aboard the New Shepard were physicist-investor Joey Hyde, entrepreneur Neal Milch, adventurer Jason Stansell and Adonis Pouroulis, a South African entrepreneur and mining engineer.",
      "All six waved, smiling broadly as they climbed out of the capsule one at a time. Benthaus was last out, carried from the spacecraft by Koenigsmann and a member of Blue Origin's recovery team to a nearby wheelchair.",
      "\"You should never give up on your dreams, right?,\" she said after landing. \"I just feel very lucky, and I'm very grateful to Blue and Hans and everyone who said yes to this journey.\"",
      "Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of a New Shepard seat, but the price is thought to be upwards of $500,000 each. How Benthaus' seat was financed was not revealed.",
      "Saturday's launch marked Blue Origin's 16th New Shepard flight with passengers aboard since Bezos, his brother and two others blasted off on the first such flight in July 2021. Including Saturday's flight, Blue Origin has now launched 92 men and women to space, including six who have flown twice.",
      "While Benthaus was the first person with a significant physical handicap to fly in space, European Space Agency astronaut John McFall, who has a prosthetic leg, has been cleared for selection to a future flight to the International Space Station.",
      "Benthaus said before launch the reaction to her flight aboard the New Shepard was mostly positive, saying she hopes more handicapped people might make their way to space.",
      "The big question for NASA and other space agencies and private companies is not so much whether handicapped astronauts can carry out their duties in the weightless environment of space. It's more about how they can handle an emergency that might require a speedy exit from their spacecraft, either on the ground or in space.",
      "In an interview with CNN, Benthaus said \"we're thinking more and more about long-duration space missions; some of us want to go to the Mars in the future.\"",
      "\"That's a very long journey. And, yes, people can get a disability on the way. People can have a stroke or break their leg or get a spinal cord injury.\"",
      "In the end, she said, \"people with disabilities actually bring value to a crew. ... You develop a very special resilience.\"",

      "During his second confirmation hearing in December, Isaacman pledged he would ensure the success of the Artemis lunar exploration program that began in 2017, during the first Trump administration.",
      "\"America will return to the moon before our great rival, and we will establish an enduring presence to understand and realize the scientific, economic and national security value on the lunar surface,\" Isaacman said.",

      "Instacart said Monday that it would halt the use of an AI-powered tool that allowed retailers to charge customers different prices for identical items on the grocery delivery platform.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, an nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway, Sprouts Farmers Market and Target were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",

    "summary": "Rapid emergence of AI will foster demand for new types of workers, including \"explainers\" and bias auditors, according to economist Robert Seamans.",
    "story": [
      "Workers with an aptitude for explaining how artificial intelligence tools function in simple terms are more likely to find success in the job market, according to an economist who focuses on the economic impact of AI.",
      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of new job that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",
      "\"AI will change the vast majority of the work we do, but it will affect each occupation in different ways,\" he said. \"A good analogy is to think about computers and the internet and how that changed jobs and the way we work.\"",
      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",
      "Seamans also expects employers to step up their hiring of instructors who can train workers on how to use a company's AI apps. His advice for workers, students and early-career employees?",
      "\"My encouragement would be for everyone to play around with AI and not assume there is one specific way you should be interacting with [AI],\" he said. \"Interact in a variety of ways because you'll get different answers.\"",

      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",

      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 06:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "ICE has filed more than 8,000 requests to toss out asylum claims in immigration court, asking judges to send immigrants to third-party countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has mounted a nationwide campaign to void the asylum claims of thousands of immigrants with active cases in immigration court by arguing that they can be deported to countries that are not their own, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "The effort appears to have intensified in recent weeks, targeting asylum-seekers with pending cases in immigration courts in Atlanta, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas and elsewhere across the U.S., multiple immigration lawyers and certified legal representatives told CBS News.",
      "Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch. Instead, they are administrative entities run by the Justice Department, which employs and oversees the judges that adjudicate the cases of people facing deportation. Lawyers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement represent the government in the proceedings.",
      "The administration's new tactic involves ICE attorneys asking the immigration judges to toss out asylum claims without hearing them on the merits. In these requests, known as \"pretermit\" motions, ICE argues that asylum-seekers fearing persecution in their home countries can instead be deported to one of several nations the Trump administration has persuaded to accept deportees who are not their citizens.",
      "As part of the effort, ICE attorneys have asked immigration judges to order asylum-seekers deported to third countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News and interviews with immigration lawyers. If granted, those petitions nullify asylum-seekers' claims and clear the way for them to be deported to third countries, absent any appeals.",
      "Previously undisclosed internal government data obtained by CBS News indicates that, as of early December, ICE attorneys had filed more than 8,000 motions in immigration court to toss out asylum claims by citing deportation agreements with third countries.",
      "The campaign is the latest move by President Trump to sharply curtail access to the American asylum system, which his administration has argued is being systematically abused by migrants who came to the U.S. for economic reasons, especially those who entered illegally along the southern border under the Biden administration.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration is \"working to get illegal aliens out of our country as quickly as possible while ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,\" the department added, citing \"lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strategy rests on a section of immigration law that disqualifies migrants from asylum if the applicant is eligible to request legal protection in another nation that has agreed to a \"safe third country\" arrangement with the U.S.",
      "In late October, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which reviews decisions by immigration courts, issued a ruling that lawyers believe will turbocharge efforts by the government to use \"safe third country\" agreements to cancel asylum cases. That order directed immigration judges to decide the motions by ICE to send immigrants to third-party countries before reviewing their asylum applications. It also placed the burden on asylum-seekers to prove they should not be sent to a third country because of fears of being persecuted there.",
      "\"You just have to give up\"",
      "While the Trump administration has argued its latest effort is meant to curb asylum fraud, multiple immigration lawyers told CBS News the campaign has affected clients with strong asylum claims who fled persecution in countries like Iran, Nicaragua and Russia.",
      "The attorneys argued the government's campaign is designed to eliminate the path to asylum in the U.S. Some said it is meant to coerce asylum-seekers into withdrawing their claims, by scaring them with the prospect of being deported to a country that is not their own.",
      "\"They see the asylum system as a whole as a problem, because it impedes them from deporting people in a quick manner,\" said Pa\u00fal Pirela, an immigration lawyer in Houston.",
      "\"If you want to apply for asylum, we're forcing you to apply in a country that you've never been to,\" Pirela continued. \"You just have to give up and go back to your country or go somewhere else,\" he added later.",
      "Pirela said one of his clients, a Nicaraguan asylum-seeker and political dissident, was ordered deported to Honduras after the government filed a pretermit motion in his case. ICE, he added, is also trying to get another client, an asylum applicant from Guatemala, ordered deported to Honduras.",
      "Atlanta immigration attorney Adriana Heffley got notice that DHS had motioned to pretermit her client's case and deport him to Uganda four days before a hearing, she told CBS News. Her client is from Iran, and was apprehended at the border when he entered the U.S. illegally last December, she said. He has been detained ever since.",
      "Heffley and her client had prepared a case arguing that he would face persecution and danger in Iran as someone who had previously been in same-sex relationships. But they had to switch gears and quickly prove he would also suffer in Uganda. The judge agreed and denied the DHS motion to preempt the case.",
      "\"Immigrants who are coming up on a hearing that will determine the course of the rest of their lives and their fate and their safety are being hit with this left-field motion just a day or two before that final hearing,\" Heffley said.",
      "New York immigration attorney David Treyster is not confident his case will see the same outcome. DHS moved to deport his client, a Russian national, and her 4-year-old child, to Uganda, he told CBS News. The judge initially planned to give Treyster 30 minutes to confer with her before hearing opposing arguments and ruling on the motion. After pleading with the judge, Treyster was able to schedule the hearing for Tuesday.",
      "The judge \"seemed to imply that her hands are being tied,\" he said, given the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling that the third-country deportations must be considered first. \"We haven't even had our hearing, [but] the judge kept saying, 'you're going to have to appeal this.'\"",
      "\"The person timely and properly applied for asylum and is in line waiting their turn, doing everything that the administration wants people to do, reporting to their court hearings, filing all their papers on time, and here we are just taking that due process away from them,\" Treyster added.",
      "Some immigration attorneys are challenging the tactic in court, including the 2019 regulation that ICE attorneys have been citing in their motions arguing that asylum-seekers can be deported to third countries.",
      "\"I think that this is in line with this administration's attempt to completely eviscerate the availability of asylum and other forms of protection in this country,\" said Blaine Bookey, legal director for San Francisco's Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, one of the groups litigating the case. \"This is, in their view, an easy way to cut off a case at the knees.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department is facing continued backlash over its partial releases of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with lawmakers and survivors denouncing the limited scope of the disclosures.",
      "The Trump administration faced a Dec. 19 deadline to release most of the government's records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law last month. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the files will be released on a rolling basis over the coming weeks due to the volume of the materials and the need to shield the personal information of survivors.",
      "A first tranche of records was made public Friday, followed by a second batch Saturday. Many of the documents contained significant redactions, including whole pages of records that were blacked out.",
      "Early Tuesday, the department released tens of thousands of additional documents from the files. It wasn't immediately clear what impact that release would have on the criticism of the earlier releases.",
      "The Justice Department also removed more than a dozen of the earlier files without an initial explanation. The department said on X on Saturday that files would continue to be \"reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the removed files was an image of a group of framed photos, including two that appeared to show Mr. Trump. The department said on Sunday that the file was \"temporarily removed\" out of an abundance of caution after federal prosecutors in New York flagged it \"for potential further action to protect victims.\" The department reposted the photo after it said a review determined that \"there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph.\" Mr. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein.",
      "A group of survivors of abuse by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate who was convicted of sex trafficking, called on Congress to hold hearings and take legal action to demand compliance with the law. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "\"It is alarming that the United States Department of Justice, the very agency tasked with upholding the law, has violated the law, both by withholding massive quantities of documents, and by failing to redact survivor identities,\" they said in a statement Monday.",
      "The survivors said the government released \"a fraction of the files,\" and said the material that was disclosed was \"riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution Monday that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes in the new year.",
      "Schumer called the Justice Department's rollout a \"blatant cover-up,\" claiming Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche \"are shielding Donald Trump from accountability, and the Senate has a duty to act.\"",
      "\"The law Congress passed is crystal clear: release the Epstein files in full so Americans can see the truth,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "Bondi said in a post on X on Sunday\u00a0that the Justice Department \"will bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims,\" and urged any survivors with information to come forward.",
      "But in July, the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that a review of the government's files related to Epstein \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna expressed dissatisfaction with the release on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday. Khanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, authored the Epstein legislation and worked together on the discharge petition to force a vote on the measure.",
      "Massie said he and Khanna are \"talking about and drafting\" a resolution to hold Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress, which he called \"the quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims.\"",
      "Inherent contempt is a rarely used tool that Congress can use to enforce compliance with its directives. A 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service called it a \"long dormant\" power that allows lawmakers \"to detain and imprison a contemnor until the individual complies with congressional demands.\" The report noted that while there \"may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines\" as an alternative, there's no precedent for Congress imposing a fine for contempt.",
      "Last year, a push by GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida to hold then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in inherent contempt fell short in the House. Though she had initially signaled that she was pursuing a resolution to hold Garland in custody, the final measure would have imposed a fine of $10,000 per day on Garland for defying a congressional subpoena.",
      "Khanna said he and Massie are \"building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.\" To force a vote on the House floor upon the chamber's return next month, the resolution would likely be offered as a privileged motion, which would require leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general had 30 days from its enactment to make public \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" in the Justice Department's possession that related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The law prohibited the government from withholding, delaying or redacting records \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" But it did allow the attorney general to redact certain portions of documents, including personally identifiable information of survivors or depictions of child sexual abuse.",
      "The law also requires the Justice Department to provide written justification for any redactions to Congress.",
      "The president, asked about the Epstein documents at an event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Monday, voiced frustration that there is still so much attention focused on them.",
      "\"I believe they gave over 100,000 pages of documents,\" he said. \"And there is tremendous backlash, it's an interesting question, because a lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they're in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin a reputation of somebody. So a lot of people are very angry that this continues.\"",
      "Epstein was under investigation in South Florida in the early 2000s, but ultimately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Miami to escape federal charges. He agreed to instead plead guilty to state prostitution charges and serve 18 months in prison.",
      "He was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019 and died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility weeks later.",

      "That's because no tickets came up winners of Monday night's jackpot of an estimated $1.6 billion jackpot.",
      "The winning numbers for that one were 3, 18, 36, 41 and 54, with a Powerball of 7.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 19:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Animal rights groups celebrate, but the Trump administration is light on specifics about phasing out federally funded medical testing on animals.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. said this weekend that he is working across the government to end all federally funded animal testing.",
      "\"All the major agency heads are committed to ending animal experimentation,\" he said in an interview with Lara Trump\u00a0on Fox News, referring to research being conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy focused specifically on monkey testing, or \"non-human primate testing,\" during his remarks. There are over 100,000 monkeys in primate testing labs around the country, with more than 20,000 more being imported every year, he said.",
      "\"We are trying to put an end to that,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Earlier this year, a CBS News investigation with the South Carolina Post & Courier documented efforts to cancel nearly $28 million in federal grants for research that relied on animals. And it found that, as federal health agencies moved to phase out research on live primates, available alternatives were not yet ready for use.",
      "It was against this backdrop that scientists at the CDC were ordered last month to phase out all their monkey research, a directive first reported in the journal Science.",
      "\"Across the Trump Administration, there is a shift to prioritize animal welfare,\" a health department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"At HHS, that includes moves to reduce unnecessary animal testing requirements and prioritizing human-based research.\"",
      "Primate testing has been an integral part of medical advancement for nearly a century, and federal regulations require that most pharmaceuticals be tested on primates before they enter human clinical studies. Experiments on monkeys are credited with major medical advancements leading to the creation of Tylenol, the COVID-19 vaccine and Ozempic, among other things.",
      "Experiments on primates make up a small portion of biomedical research overall, but Deborah Fuller, director of the NIH-funded Washington National Primate Research Center, said they are essential for developing therapies that continue to save lives.",
      "\"The majority of the biomedical interventions that we have today went through a non-human primate at some point,\" she said. \"Shutting down a non-human primate research program, you're actually shooting yourself in the foot.\"",
      "For example, 200 primates are part of CDC's ongoing research into treatments for HIV and other infectious diseases. Non-human primates are the only animals that closely model HIV infection in humans, according to Fuller.",
      "\"It is a very small slice of all of the animal research that's done. And it is only done because that is the only model that can effectively answer the question that's being addressed,\" she said.",
      "But animal rights groups, who have found allies in the Trump administration, say this type of testing is outdated.",
      "\"I think it's baseless fear-mongering to suggest we need to torture animals to improve human health. All of the available evidence suggests otherwise,\" said Justin Goodman, senior vice president of advocacy and public policy at White Coat Waste Project. The organization",
      "advocates to end all federally funded animal testing and works closely with the Trump administration to cut grant programs that rely on it.",
      "Kennedy's pledge was \"unprecedented,\" Goodman said.",
      "\"As the head of the agency that funds more animal testing than anyone else in the world, RFK's commitment to ending testing on primates and other animals is game-changing,\" he said. \"We are optimistic \u2014 but the devil is in the details.\"",
      "The details for how the federal government intends to actually end animal testing remain sparse. The fate of monkeys already in labs across the country is also unclear.",
      "Kennedy said his agency is exploring options to retire animals to sanctuaries. But there are limited facilities equipped to take in the thousands of primates that may need continued medical monitoring. The estimated cost of transporting the animals alone could cost millions of dollars, even if there were available space for the animals in question.",
      "\"We need to make sure we have space somewhere that can take care of these animals for the rest of their lives,\" said Sally Thompson-Iritani, an associate professor at the University of Washington, who helps oversee the university's animal care program. \"And we currently don't have an infrastructure that supports that.\"",
      "\"I think there's legitimately logistical issues that have to be sorted out, which is why we are anxious to hear more details from HHS about what its plans are,\" Goodman agreed, calling such an effort \"a massive undertaking.\"",
      "Moreover, some animals that have been infected with dangerous diseases like Ebola would not be able to move to a sanctuary and would likely need to be euthanized, Goodman said.",
      "Kennedy has pushed for alternatives to animal testing, suggesting that AI and computer generated models are more accurate and efficient methods for predicting health outcomes in humans. The FDA and NiH put out updated guidelines advocating for the phasing out of live animal models in favor of alternative technologies this spring.",
      "But researchers on the cutting edge of these alternatives don't believe that the new technologies are ready to completely replace primate models.",
      "\"I want to see us get out of the business of using animals in research,\" said Paul Locke in an interview with CBS News over the summer. Locke is an environmental health lawyer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and serves on the board of the school's Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing.",
      "\"The question is when. When can we do that and reach the double goal of having better science and virtually no animals? The answer is not tomorrow.\"",

According to Garmin, their emergency \"Autoland\" system was activated for the first time ever for the landing at around 2 p.m. Saturday. The landing was successful and the charter company for the plane told CBS Colorado that everyone involved was OK.",
      "According to LiveATC and a pilot who heard the communication at the time, a robotic voice over air traffic control communication can be heard saying, \"Pilot incapacitation, two miles south\u2026 emergency Autoland in 19 minutes on runway 3-0.\"",
      "It came not long after taking off from Aspen's airport and pilots reported a pressurization problem while flying over the Denver Metro area.",
      "\"We lost pressurization,\" the pilot told air traffic control.",
      "Cases of pilot incapacitation are rare, but nearly always fatal. The Autoland system works with the push of a button and can be activated by anyone on board the aircraft or can self-activate after a prolonged period of no pilot activity.",
      "In the air traffic control audio, the same robotic voice can also be heard describing the flight's tail number as N479BR. On Flight Aware, this tail number is shown landing at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on Saturday afternoon, flying in from Aspen.",
      "Local flight instructor Adam Lendi was with a student when he says he heard the traffic over his radio and went out to see the plane land.",
      "\"We saw the fire trucks starting to head out,\" Lendi went on to explain, \"I was familiar with the auto land systems, and I recognized that's what was going on. So I told my student, I said, 'We might be witnessing something pretty cool here.'\"",
      "In a statement to CBS Colorado, Garmin said: \"Garmin can confirm that an emergency Autoland activation occurred at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, Colorado. The Autoland took place on Saturday, Dec. 20, resulting in a successful landing. We look forward to sharing additional details at the appropriate time.\"",
      "Flight Aware shows the operators of the plane that landed at that time as Buffalo River Aviation, who say everyone involved is OK.",
      "On Monday, the company sent CBS News Colorado a statement, saying no passengers were on board and that the pilots allowed the system to retain control of the plane, \"exercising conservative judgement.\"",
      "\"Climbing through 23,000ft MSL, the aircraft experienced a rapid, uncommanded loss of pressurization. As per standard procedures, the two pilots immediately put on their oxygen masks,\" the company's CEO Chris Townsley. \"The aircraft, equipped with Garmin Aviation's latest Emergency Descent Mode (EDM) and Autoland systems, automatically engaged exactly as designed when the cabin altitude exceeded the prescribed safe levels. The system selected a suitable airport per Garmin criteria (KBJC, Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport), navigated to it, and communicated automatically along the way.\"",
      "Townsley said that reports of the pilots being incapacitated are \"incorrect\" and were the result of the technology's automated communication and reporting functions.",
      "\"In this case, the crew consciously elected to preserve and use all available tools and minimize additional variables in an unpredictable, emergent situation, prioritizing life and a safe outcome over all other factors, as they are trained to do. The aircraft returned home the following day without incident,\" Townsley said. \"Buffalo River Aviation is grateful to the pilots for their exceptional judgment and execution of protocols, and to the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport and Denver Center Tracon personnel for their assistance and support during this event.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced plans to build a new \"Trump class\" of battleships, part of the Pentagon's new \"Golden Fleet.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced plans to build a new fleet of Navy battleships, anchoring what he called the Pentagon's \"Golden Fleet.\"",
      "The president said he approved plans to begin constructing \"two brand-new, very large, largest we've ever built, battleships.\" He later said he expects to build a total of 10 ships in short order, and ultimately 20 to 25. He made the announcement flanked by renderings of ships that were referred to as \"Trump class.\"",
      "Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate, Mr. Trump said, \"each one of these will be the largest battleship in the history of our country, the largest battleship in the history of the world, ever built.\" The president made the announcement alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of the Navy John Phelan.",
      "\"As commander-in-chief, it is my great honor to announce that I have approved a plan for the Navy to begin the construction of two brand-new, very large, largest we've ever built, battleships,\" he said.",
      "\"There's never been anything like these ships,\" the president continued. \"These have been under design consideration for a long time. And it started with me in my first term, because I said, 'Why aren't we doing battleships like we used to?'\"",
      "The president said the U.S. is \"desperately in need of ships\" because some of the United States' ships \"have gotten old and tired and obsolete.\" The Trump administration is trying to address U.S. shipbuilding shortfalls through multiple administrations, and beef up the United States' shipbuilding supply chain.",
      "The Navy's Phelan said the president has long talked about the need for battleships, and Phelan said that in speaking with other Naval leaders, he agrees.",
      "\"The future Trump-class battleship, the U.S.S. Defiant, will be the largest, deadliest, and most versatile, and best-looking warship anywhere on the world's oceans,\" Phelan said, thanking Mr. Trump for this \"game-changing capability for the United States' Navy.\"",
      "Phelan described the Trump-class battleship as an updated version of the Iowa-class battleship, calling this a \"generational investment.\"",
      "\"Now, this new battleship will command everything from warships to drones and everything in between,\" Phelan said. \"We're going to make battle groups great again, and this is just one piece of the president's Golden Fleet that we're going to build with the investments he talked about.\"",
      "Asked if the ships are being built to counter China, the president said, \"It's a counter to everybody. It's not China. We get along great with China.\" The president said, hopefully, the U.S. never needs to use them.",
      "Mr. Trump said the ships should take about two-and-a-half years to build.",
      "Phelan announced plans last week to build a new class of warship as a part of the president's \"Golden Fleet.\" In a video he posted Friday to social media, Phelan said the goal for the new Frigate class is to have American-designed ships made by Americans, with an eye on 2028 for launching the first ship.",
      "\"We're done admiring the problem. Our focus is on readiness,\" Phelan said in the video.",
      "The president's announcement Monday comes as the Trump administration has built up the United States' increased naval presence in Latin America amid tensions with Venezuela. The U.S. on Saturday announced the seizure of a second vessel in international waters, this one most recently docked off the coast of Venezuela, after the president announced a \"blockade\" of all oil tankers coming in or out of the country.",
      "During his announcement Monday, the president brought up his administration's strikes on alleged drug boats.",
      "\"And soon, we'll be starting the same program on land,\" he said. \"The land is much easier.\"",
      "The administration has also pressured the Venezuelan government in recent weeks, accusing it of working with drug cartels \u2014 which it denies. The president said Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro can do \"whatever he wants,\" but gave a warning.",
      "\"We have a massive armada formed, the biggest we've ever had, and by far the biggest we've ever had in South America,\" Mr. Trump said. But he also said if Maduro \"plays tough, it'll be the last time he's ever able to play tough.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:21:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Analysts point to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as driving the year-end surge.",
    "story": [
      "Gold prices soared above $4,400 on Monday to reach a new all-time high, as analysts pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as key drivers of the surge.",
      "The price of the precious metal traded at\u00a0 $4,475 per ounce at 4 p.m. EDT after hitting a high of $4,477 per ounce earlier in the day. The asset has risen more than 70% since the start of this year. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation.",
      "\"The metals trade has been strong all year, and particularly for gold,\" Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, told CBS News. \"As its fundamentals remain intact, gold digested its recent rally to all-time highs quite well.\"",
      "Silver prices were also rallying on Monday, reaching $69 by 4 p.m. EDT. The metal is up 130% since the start of the year.",
      "Both gold and silver are on pace to reach all-time closing highs today, according to analysts. The rally comes amid expectations for a strong finish in the\u00a0stock market, where tech gains have helped boost performance.",
      "What's driving the surge in gold prices?",
      "Investors are moving money into gold due to a swirl of geopolitical factors, analysts note.",
      "Bond yields around the world floated higher at the same time major global currencies like the yen weakened, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at online brokerage platform FxPro, said in a statement. The combination is reviving interest in the so-called \"debasement trade\" \u2014 a strategy of moving money out of fiat currencies in favor of hard assets like gold, he noted.",
      "Other geopolitical risks, including the U.S. blockade of oil supplies from Venezuela and Ukraine's attack on a Russian shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, were also pushing investors toward gold on Monday, Kuptsikevich added.",
      "Softer monetary policy may also be driving the upswing in gold prices this year, with investors more bullish after three consecutive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many on Wall Street expect the central bank to continue to ease monetary policy in 2026, while President Trump is set to nominate a new central bank chief before Fed chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"The latest leg of the rally has been driven by the market pricing in an increasingly gold-friendly 2026 outlook, with lower rates and a potentially softer dollar acting as tailwinds for the bullion,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs, a New York-based investment company.",
      "Central banks in multiple countries are also buying more gold, Yates added, helping drive up the asset's price.",
      "Demand for the precious metal from monetary authorities like the National Bank of Poland has risen in recent months, according to the World Gold Council, a trade association for the gold industry. Central bank gold purchases through October totaled 254 tonnes, a slower pace than the previous three years, the World Gold Council said earlier this month.",
      "Yates said central bank holdings are still far below their historical levels.",
      "What's the forecast for gold in 2026?",
      "Despite investor exuberance this year, the gold rally may not continue its run in 2026, according to Capital Economics. The investment advisor firm predicted in a Monday research note that the price of the precious metal could fall to $3,500 by the end of next year \u2014 and that the drop will act as a drag on silver prices.",
      "\"So goes gold, so goes silver: the end of the speculative boom in the former will also kill off the rally in the latter,\" Capital Economics said in the research note.",
      "Other analysts hold a more optimistic outlook. Yates said he expects lower interest rates and a potentially weak U.S. dollar to help boost the case for hard assets like silver into next year.",
      "\"Overall, we continue to believe we are in the early innings of a broader precious metals rally and remain constructive on both gold and silver,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "When the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety announced it would be introducing a robust new array of classes to help people safely buy, use and store firearms, the decision caught some longtime supporters off guard.",
      "\"They need to remember who it was that was there to help them get where they are,\" said Colorado state Sen. Tom Sullivan, who began supporting the group after losing his son Alex in the 2012 Aurora mass shooting. \"It's people who are out there who are visiting cemeteries and going to church services.\"",
      "Though it may have surprised some, officials at Everytown for Gun Safety told CBS News their decision to enhance efforts to train gun users was wholly consistent with its mission.",
      "The organization was galvanized more than a decade ago by the horrors of the Sandy Hook school shooting to begin lobbying for stronger background checks, an assault weapons ban and other measures aimed at reducing gun violence. Greg Lickenbrock, a firearms expert who helped design the group's new gun training initiatives, said his goal is to expand the group's reach.",
      "\"I'm a responsible gun owner who believes in common-sense gun laws. Everything we do at Everytown is about safety and responsibility,\" Lickenbrock said. \"We're not abandoning anything.\"",
      "Everytown is marketing the new programming under the name TrainSMART, and plans to offers a variety of courses online where students can choose either on-demand or live Zoom-style instruction. The courses cover a wide range of topics including how to buy a gun, gun ownership, gun safety and marksmanship. The group hopes to offer in-person classes as soon as early next year.",
      "\"For Everytown to move into the business of working with gun owners and meeting gun owners where they are \u2014 that is a crucial step in promoting gun safety,\" said Chris Marvin, a former Black Hawk helicopter pilot and fourth generation Army combat veteran who helped design the program.",
      "Marvin said the course relies on the same principles he learned during his time with the military: training, safety and accountability.",
      "\"If it works for the military, if it works for the nation's profession of arms, it should be the best way to approach civilian gun training as well,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Marvin says that includes learning about the components of your firearm and proper storage practices for locking it up.",
      "In anticipation for its move into in-person instruction, the group has been hosting events at various gun ranges across the country to train and evaluate potential future instructors.",
      "Still, not all survivors and families of victims have bought into the new approach.",
      "Sullivan believes that with gun violence still rampant in the U.S., groups like Everytown need to focus on their original mission.",
      "\"I hope that we're still reading from the same book, but maybe \u2026 they're a couple chapters ahead of me,\" Sullivan said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ivf-treatments-aetna-same-sex-couples-settlement/",
    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:21:16 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has approved a preliminary agreement for a class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples as they do with heterosexual couples.",
    "story": [
      "Like many young girls, Mara Berton and June Higginbotham both knew from an early age they wanted families and to become mothers. But as lesbians, they were excluded from accessing the same fertility treatment insurance benefits offered to heterosexual peers.",
      "Instead, like many other same-sex couples, Berton and Higginbotham, who live in California, had to pay $45,000 out of pocket to conceive while heterosexual colleagues with the same insurance plan had many of those costs covered.",
      "\"We knew it wasn't right,\" Berton said in an exclusive interview with CalMatters. She joined a class action lawsuit challenging the policy. \"What we're fighting for is about family building and having kids ... It was really important to both of us, I think, that other couples not have to do this.\"",
      "Last week, in a landmark settlement, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California Haywood Gilliam Jr. approved a preliminary agreement for the class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples \u2014 like artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization \u2014 as they do with heterosexual couples. It is the first case requiring a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees. An estimated 2.8 million LGBTQ members will benefit, including 91,000 Californians.",
      "Under the settlement, Aetna will also pay at least $2 million in damages to California-based members who qualify. Those who may be eligible must submit a claim by June 29, 2026.",
      "\"I truly hope that this is the first of many insurers to change their policy,\" said Alison Tanner, senior litigation counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center. \"We were looking at that as an issue of inequality \u2014 that folks who were in same-sex relationships were being treated differently.\"",
      "Roughly 9 million additional Californians will soon have access to mandated fertility benefits under a new law taking effect in January. The law applies to state-regulated plans \u2014 which Aetna is not in this case \u2014 and amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people.",
      "Previously, Aetna's policy required enrollees to engage in six to 12 months of \"unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse\" without conceiving before qualifying for fertility benefits, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women \"without a male partner\" to access benefits only after undergoing six to 12 cycles of artificial insemination unsuccessfully depending on age.",
      "Lawyers argued that the policy fundamentally treated LGBTQ members differently and effectively denied them access to the benefit, which can be prohibitively expensive for many people.",
      "In an email, Aetna spokesperson Phillip Blando said the plan provides infertility benefits in accordance with each member's plan, coverage rules and applicable law.",
      "\"Aetna is committed to equal access to infertility coverage and reproductive health coverage for all its members, and we will continue to strive toward improving access to services for our entire membership,\" Blando said.",
      "Berton, who was the lead plaintiff in the case, said she was blindsided by the policy. She had consulted with a fertility clinic and decided to move forward with donor sperm and artificial insemination, when a representative from Aetna called and said she did not meet the definition of infertility.",
      "She appealed the decision multiple times; she was rejected. The experience felt \"dehumanizing,\" her wife Higginbotham said.",
      "Insurance had dictated Berton attempt 12 rounds of artificial insemination before she would be eligible for benefits. Her doctors recommended no more than four rounds.",
      "Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a policy like that could only be designed to dissuade people from accessing their health benefits. Doctors typically recommend three to four cycles of artificial insemination before IVF, but Tipton said there have also been studies showing it is more efficient and cost effective to go straight to IVF.",
      "In 2023, the society updated its medical definition of infertility to include LGBTQ folks and individuals who don't have partners. They did so in part to stop insurers from denying claims like Berton and Higginbotham's.",
      "\"The driving force was a realization that it takes two kinds of gametes to have kids,\" Tipton said. \"Regardless of the cause of that absence, you have to have access in order to be treated for a fertility issue.\"",
      "Since the definition changed, Tipton said more employers and insurers are covering benefits for LGBTQ folks or single people. They have also leveraged the definition to enact statewide benefits expansions, including California's upcoming fertility benefits mandate.",
      "Berton and Higginbotham said they also worried about running out of donor sperm that matched Higginbotham's Jewish and Native American heritage \u2014 and was limited in supply.",
      "\"I don't feel like your insurance should be involved in those types of decisions and kind of determine your journey,\" Berton said.",
      "The couple pulled together money from family members and decided to proceed even without coverage. After four unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, they moved on to IVF, partially to give themselves the best chance of conceiving with the donor they chose.",
      "The experience was \"all consuming\" and emotionally difficult as Berton endured hormone injections, egg retrievals and a miscarriage. But today, she and Higginbotham have two healthy twin girls whose favorite thing is to play on the swings and \"take every book off of their shelf\" for their mothers to read.",
      "The couple achieved their family dreams before the lawsuit concluded. Even so, Higginbotham said she hopes the settlement will help other LGBTQ couples across the country.",
      "\"I know people that don't have children, that wanted children, because the stuff isn't covered. I know people that their timeline was delayed and maybe they have fewer kids than they wanted,\" Higginbotham said. \"The settlement is such a huge step forward that is really righting a huge wrong.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said on Monday that it is suspending leases for five offshore U.S. wind farms because of national security risks identified by the Department of Defense in classified reports.",
      "The Department of the Interior \"is PAUSING leases for 5 expensive, unreliable, heavily subsidized offshore wind farms!  ONE natural gas pipeline supplies as much energy as these 5 projects COMBINED,\" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum wrote in a social media post.",

      "The Interior Department didn't disclose the specific security issues raised by the Defense Department, instead pointing to unclassified federal reports that have found wind projects can create risks because the movement of turbine blades, combined with their reflective towers, can create radar interference.",
      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",
      "Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged\u00a0Trump's Day One order\u00a0that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.",
      "Halted projects",
      "Vineyard Wind 1, located about 15 miles south of the Massachusetts islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, is slated to include 62 wind turbines, each spaced by one nautical mile apart, according to the project's website. About half of those turbines were operational in October, the Vineyard Times reported that month.",
      "Once fully developed, the project is projected to generate renewable energy for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Revolution Wind, a project located off the coast of Rhode Island, is 80% completed, according to its website. It's operated by renewable energy company Orsted, which didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Dominion Energy's CVOW, which stands for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, is the largest offshore wind project in the U.S., with 176 turbines. The project was projected to be up and running by the end of 2026, according to its website.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Dominion said the Trump administration's order threatens \"thousands of jobs\" and could create energy inflation. It added that the project would also supply energy for the nation's security apparatus and artificial intelligence data centers.",

    "summary": "The main distillery will be closed for site enhancements, the company said. The pause comes after whiskey production has dropped amid a challenging year.",
    "story": [
      "The maker of Jim Beam bourbon whiskey said it plans to pause production at its main distillery in Kentucky starting Jan. 1.",
      "Jim Beam, which is owned by a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings, said in an email to CBS News that its distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, will temporarily halt production \"while we take the opportunity to invest in site enhancements.\" The company plans to keep its James B. Beam campus open for visitors during that time, the company added.",
      "Jim Beam will continue to distill at its Fred B. Noe craft distillery in Clermont and Booker Noe distillery in Boston, Kentucky.",
      "The pause comes amid several challenges in the wine and spirits industry. Americans overall are drinking less, with Gallup finding that the share of U.S. adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, near a 90-year low.",
      "Exports of U.S.-produced spirits fell 9% in the second quarter, partly due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, according to an October report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. Exports to Canada were particularly hard hit, declining by 85% during the period, after Canadian retailers pulled U.S. spirits from shelves in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs, the group noted.",
      "Through August, whiskey distillers had produced 55 million fewer proof gallons this year than a year ago, a decline of 28%, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A proof gallon is one U.S. gallon of liquid that is 50% proof alcohol.",
      "Whiskey connoisseurs may not have to worry about supplies running low. Kentucky warehouses now hold a record 16.1 million barrels of aging bourbon, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. The total \u2014 reported in October \u2014 marks the highest level since the repeal of Prohibition and reflects a 27% increase from 2024, the group said.",
      "The surge in bourbon supplies is partly due to an increase in the number of distillers located in Kentucky, the group said. But the industry is also witnessing a dip in demand due to uncertainty over tariffs, declining exports and shifts in drinking habits, it added.",
      "Bourbon, a type of whiskey, must adhere to U.S. distilling laws to be labeled as such. For instance, the liquor must be aged in new, charred oak containers and the grain recipe must be at least 51% corn, according to whiskey tourism site Bourbon Country.",

    "summary": "Doctors and scientists say this year's influenza season could be tougher than usual, with a new version of the flu virus, called H3N2, spreading quickly.",
    "story": [
      "Doctors and scientists say this year's influenza season could be tougher than usual. A new version of the flu virus, called H3N2, is spreading quickly. At the same time, fewer people are getting flu shots.",
      "\"This flu season is no joke. We are seeing more cases than we would expect for this time of year,\" Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said on \"CBS Mornings.\" Specifically, she explained, \"we are seeing influenza A, and within influenza A we are seeing a subtype or variant called H3N2.\"",
      "\"It's pretty likely to be an H3N2-dominated flu season,\" said Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution. \"I don't see any reason to think that this is an unprecedentedly bad one, but current indicators are that it may be substantially more severe than the typical winter flu season.\"",
      "Bloom said the H3N2 virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize, but a flu shot could still help.",
      "\"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do,\" he explained. \"It's not going to eliminate their chance of getting infected, but it does mitigate their risk.\"",
      "A changing virus",
      "Other experts share Bloom's concern. \"I would say pretty worried,\" said Dr. Helen Chu, a flu expert at the University of Washington. \"Based on the U.K. and Japan data, it's looking like it's causing a lot of cases of flu and hospitalizations.\"",
      "She said flu activity \"is starting everywhere right now,\" overlapping with RSV but coming before a likely winter COVID-19 wave. Early flu vaccine data from other countries show good protection at first, around 70% in children, but that may not last.",
      "\"Total season effectiveness is probably going to actually be much, much lower,\" Chu warned, because immunity fades over time.",
      "Trevor Bedford, who also studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said H3N2 tends to evolve faster than other influenza strains.",
      "\"I expect more H3 incidence than the typical year and poorer vaccine effectiveness,\" he said. These large \"jumps\" in how the virus appears to our immune system usually occur every three to four years, he explained.",
      "Stephen Morse, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, noted that influenza's behavior still defies confident forecasting.",
      "\"Many excellent scientists have come to grief trying to predict what influenza will do \u2014 consider 1976,\" he said, referring to a year with a notorious scare over a swine flu outbreak that didn't end up spreading widely. He added that the emergence of the H3N2 K subclade was \"one of those surprises,\" and while surveillance detected it quickly, \"the bad news is that we weren't really prepared for it.\"",
      "Why that matters: H3N2 is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors. The new strain has changed in ways that make it harder for the immune system to recognize, so more people may get sick and need hospital care.",
      "The flu vaccine still helps",
      "Even with these changes, doctors say the annual flu shot is still the best protection available.",
      "\"The match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good,\" said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. \"Even though we are expecting a H3N2 mismatch, vaccine effectiveness doesn't always correlate with vaccine match. \u2026 Bottom line, still a good idea to get the vaccine.\"",
      "Early-season data from the U.K. suggest the flu vaccine is still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children, even with the H3N2 mismatch. Protection in adults appears more modest and is expected to decline over time. Experts stress that flu vaccines are designed mainly to reduce severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths \u2014 not necessarily to prevent every infection.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, added that people who work with animals should also be vaccinated. \"Persons working with cattle, poultry, and pigs should receive their annual influenza vaccine,\" he said. That helps stop human viruses from mixing with animal ones and creating new strains that could be dangerous to both.",
      "Morse also underscored the value of vaccination despite the virus's unpredictability.",
      "\"I still advocate the annual influenza vaccine\u2026 It's still a good precaution,\" he said, pointing out that flu shots help protect against multiple circulating viruses, not just H3N2.",
      "Flu symptoms to watch for, and what you can do",
      "The CDC estimates there have been 4.6 million flu cases across the U.S. since this season began, and 1,900 patients have died from it, including at least three children.",
      "\"There are tons of these cases throughout the country, and it's causing a very, very severe flu,\" Kravitz said. \"Symptoms that are very intense, they come on really, really rapidly. It's very contagious, so it is spreading quickly through communities.\"",
      "Flu is often accompanied by \"high, high fevers, like 103, 104 degrees Fahrenheit,\" as well as body aches and cough, Kravitz said. In addition, she added, \"we see vomiting in children this year, specifically with this variant of the flu.\"",
      "She advised parents to help keep their child hydrated, and \"if the symptoms last a long time, more than four or five days, especially that high fever, it's a good idea to call their pediatrician.\"",
      "Experts say there's no need to panic, but it's important to prepare.",
      "\"Get your vaccine,\" Chu said. \"It's still not too late.\" The shot helps protect against severe illness and may even give \"some cross protection against H5N1 as well,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security has tripled its \"exit bonus\" for undocumented migrants who voluntarily depart the United States through self-deportation, increasing the financial incentive from $1,000 to $3,000 for those who register with the U.S. government and depart the country by the end of the calendar year.",
      "DHS says all qualified participants who leave by Dec. 31, 2025, will also receive free airfare to their home countries and be waived of certain civil fines or penalties tied to remaining illegally in the U.S., if they voluntarily self-deport using the rebranded CBP Home app. The smartphone app is modeled off the Biden administration's CBP One platform.",
      "Under the Trump administration's policy, migrants are instructed to use the platform to signal their intent to depart. If determined to be eligible, DHS officials say they will receive travel assistance plus the $3,000 paid stipend once the U.S. government confirms the individual has left the country.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says that those who do not take advantage of the temporary incentive will be \"found,\" \"arrested\" and \"never return\" to the U.S.",
      "The CBP One app was originally built under the previous administration to schedule asylum appointments, but under the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda, it has been remodeled under a voluntary departure framework to permit those without lawful status to track their exit.",
      "DHS says the bonus stipend is part of a holiday season campaign aimed at accelerating removals and reducing taxpayer costs, with travel support typically considered less expensive than traditional detention and deportation operations. As of May 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated the average cost to arrest, detain and remove an undocumented migrant is approximately $17,000.",
      "As part of the self-deportation program, DHS says participants are deprioritized for ICE arrest and detention so long as they demonstrate \"meaningful strides\" toward leaving the U.S., though officials have not released detailed guidance explaining how long that protection lasts or how any compliance is judged.",
      "While ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrests nationwide are largely considered the most visible arm of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, the president has simultaneously pushed to compel self-deportation of families and unaccompanied children who entered the country without permission.",
      "In October, the U.S. government announced plans to grant migrant teenagers a $2,500 stipend if they choose to return to their home countries voluntarily, CBS News previously reported.",
      "DHS says that since January 2025, 1.9 million undocumented immigrants have \"voluntarily self-deported,\" with \"tens of thousands\" doing so through the CBP Home program specifically. Those figures have not been independently verified by CBS News, and DHS has not publicly released a detailed breakdown showing how many individuals received government-funded travel or stipends versus those who departed on their own.",

      "The best chances for a white Christmas this week in the U.S. are across the northern halves of Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota and the northern Great Lakes, according to Scott Kleebauer, a meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center.",
      "\"Around the Adirondacks, across northern New England and into northern Maine. Those are the areas that look to be pretty good to have a white Christmas,\" he said.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines a white Christmas as at least 1 inch of snow on the ground on the morning of Dec. 25.",
      "Other areas may still \"hang on to the white Christmas idea\" despite longer odds, Kleebauer added.",
      "The chances decrease the farther west you go from Minnesota, and there's a very low chance of no snow across much of South Dakota, Iowa and the South.",
      "A substantial ridge of high pressure is expected to develop across the southern central Plains, Kleebauer said.",
      "\"That [ridge] is going to control so much of the weather pattern over the course of several days into next week, and we're going to see temperatures are going to be well above normal,\" he told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Temperatures will be well above normal all the way into Minnesota and the Dakotas, though some of those areas already have a decent snowpack.",
      "\"It's going to be really hard to melt all the snow, even with the warm temperatures across the northern latitudes up here across the upper Midwest,\" Kleebauer said.",
      "Overall, chances for a white Christmas will be limited farther South and West.",
      "\"The East is going to get a little bit lucky because it looks like the Northeast is going to remain at least near normal \u2014 they're going to kind of stay away from the worst of the ridge,\" he said.",

      "Look up the historical odds for a white Christmas where you are",
      "Historically, the northern tier of states near Canada has the highest chances of a white Christmas, along with parts of the East such as northern Maine and the northern Great Lakes, which are all \"pretty prone to having a white Christmas,\" Kleebauer said.",
      "The map below shows the historical likelihood of having at least 1 inch of snow on the ground on Christmas Day at weather stations across the United States, according to data from NOAA.",
      "It is based on the 1991-2020 U.S. Climate Normals, the most recent 30-year averages for climate measures such as temperature, precipitation, snowfall and freeze dates, calculated using observations from nearly 15,000 stations nationwide.",
      "Dark gray areas on the map indicate places where the probability of snow on Christmas typically has been less than 10%, while white areas show probabilities greater than 90%.",
      "Among major cities, Minneapolis-St. Paul has one of the highest chances of a white Christmas historically, at about 74%. Other northern cities have lower odds, including Cleveland (39%), Detroit (35%), Chicago (34%), Indianapolis (26%) and New York City (13%).",
      "Southern states have had the lowest likelihood of a white Christmas.",
      "\"As you move south, there's still a chance, but it definitely degrades, especially once you get, say, south of I-80,\" Kleebauer said. \"South of I-80 is where you really start seeing a precipitous drop off of the chances for a white Christmas, unless you're in like the highest elevations of the Appalachian Mountains in like West Virginia.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of the National Economic Council Kevin Hassett said Sunday that President Trump's idea to give Americans $2,000 checks funded by tariff revenue will \"depend on what happens with Congress.\"",
      "\"I would expect that in the new year, the president will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Since July, Mr. Trump has floated a possible rebate for some Americans based on tariff revenue. And last month, the president posted on social media that a \"dividend of at least $2,000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News last month that the checks would likely go to households making less than $100,000. He said at the time it remained \"in discussion.\"",
      "Hassett noted that Congress would have to approve the funds, which would likely be issued through the tax code and require lawmakers to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks. But Hassett touted \"a lot of positive news about the economy\" since July that he suggested makes the checks more possible.",
      "\"We've had a couple of quarters of almost 4% growth, we've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row, the deficit relative to last year is down by $600 billion,\" Hassett said. \"And so, in the summer, I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that. But now I'm pretty sure that there is.\"",
      "Hassett said the funds could come from tariff revenue, while noting that \"in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those money. That's an appropriation.\"",
      "The comments come as the president has defended the tariffs as one of his administration's signature policies, touting the approach for helping the U.S. raise new revenue and driving investment in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Hassett said most of the tariffs put in place this year \"have proven their mettle,\" pointing to high growth, reduction in the trade deficit and lower imports from China.",
      "\"So there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space,\" Hassett said. \"But there are also things that we're hearing, when we talk to people like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S., there are also things that maybe could be adjusted.\"",
      "Hassett said \"there's an appetite to exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S.,\" because of factors like climate. He said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is leading that effort.",
      "The top White House economic adviser also expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will side with the administration as the justices consider whether the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs under a federal emergency powers law. The administration has relied on the law to impose duties on nearly every U.S. trading partner.",
      "\"We really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us,\" Hassett said.",

Another 112 tickets purchased ahead of the drawing won $50,000 prizes, and 22 tickets won $150,000 prizes, according to the game.",
      "\"Powerball is giving players a chance to dream bigger than ever this holiday season,\" said Matt Strawn, Powerball Product Group chair and Iowa Lottery CEO.",
      "Monday's drawing will be the 46th since the last time a jackpot was won \u2013 the longest such Powerball run. A $1.787 billion jackpot was hit Sept. 6 in Missouri and Texas.",
      "To win the grand prize, a ticket must match the five white balls pulled during the drawing as well as the red Powerball. A single jackpot winner would have the choice of taking a lump sum payment estimated at $735.3 million or opting for a payout via an annuity, which would consist of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year.",
      "The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, according to Powerball, but lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade. Drawings take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 11 p.m. ET.",
      "In 2022, a single ticket sold in Altadena, California, claimed a $2.04 billion jackpot, the largest in both Powerball and lottery history. The first Powerball drawing was in 1992.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:05:56 -0500",
    "summary": "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S. this month.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is still pursuing a sanctioned oil tanker in international waters, a U.S. official told CBS News on Monday, as the Trump administration appeared to intensify its targeting of oil vessels amid a pressure campaign directed at the Venezuelan government.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker, called the Bella 1, over the weekend, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official said.",
      "But the ship \u2014 which had not yet entered Venezuelan waters \u2014 refused to be boarded and sailed away, fleeing toward the Caribbean. An active pursuit began, with the vessel sending distress signals to nearby ships. That pursuit remained underway as of Monday afternoon, according to the official.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Sunday the pursuit involved \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion.\"",
      "\"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said.",
      "The Coast Guard's pursuit of the tanker was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters did not give a specific location for the operation or the name of the vessel being pursued.",
      "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S.\u00a0this month.",
      "In a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries. A U.S. official told CBS News that the interdiction of the vessel followed a similar playbook to an earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
      "And earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0called The Skipper that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the tanker seized on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",
      "\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" he added. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"",
      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Monday he was \"deeply angered\" by the move and warned Washington to respect Denmark's sovereignty.",

      "\"It is with immense sadness that we announce the death of beloved Chris,\" said a statement on behalf of his wife and two children, the\u00a0BBC reported. \"He passed away peacefully in hospital earlier today following a short illness, surrounded by his family.\"",
      "Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "Christopher Anton Rea was born in 1951 in Middlesbrough, in northeast England, to an Italian father and Irish mother. He was one of seven children.",

      "Rea found fame in the 1980s in Britain with hits such as \"Fool (If You Think It's Over)\" and \"Let's Dance.\"",
      "Throughout his career, Rea recorded 25 solo albums, two of which \u2014 \"The Road to Hell\" in 1989 and \"Auberge\" in 1991 \u2014 went to No. 1 in the country. The song he is probably most well-known for in the U.S., \"Fool (If You Think It's Over),\" earned Rea a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist in 1979.",
      "\"Driving Home for Christmas,\" first released in 1986, became one of the U.K.'s most loved festive songs and featured in a Marks and Spencer's TV advertisement this year.",

His songs helped put Middlesbrough on the map and he leaves behind a brilliant legacy.\"",
      "He had suffered from health problems, including pancreatic cancer, and in 2016, he suffered a stroke. In more recent years, he turned away from pop and released several bluesy records.",

    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 A man accused of killing 15 people at Sydney's Bondi Beach obtained firearms training in New South Wales state outside Sydney with his father, according to Australian police documents released on Monday.",
      "The documents, made public following Naveed Akram's video court appearance from a Sydney hospital where he has been treated for an abdominal injury, said the two men recorded footage justifying the meticulously planned attack.",
      "Officers wounded Akram at the scene of the Dec. 14 shooting and killed his father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram.",
      "The state government confirmed Naveed Akram was transferred Monday from a hospital to a prison. Authorities identified neither facility.",
      "The 24-year-old and his father began their attack by throwing four improvised explosive devices toward a crowd celebrating an annual Jewish event at Bondi Beach, but the devices failed to explode, the documents said.",
      "Police described the devices as three aluminum pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb containing an explosive, gunpowder and steel ball bearings. None detonated, but police described them as \"viable\" IEDs.",
      "The pair had rented a room in the Sydney suburb of Campsie for three weeks before they left at 2:16 a.m. on the day of the attack. CCTV recorded them carrying what police allege were two shotguns, a rifle, five IEDs and two homemade ISIS flags wrapped in blankets.",
      "Police also released images of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge, providing them with an elevated vantage point and the protection of waist-high concrete walls.",
      "The largest IED was found after the gun battle near the footbridge in the trunk of the son's car, which had been left draped with the flags.",
      "Authorities had been looking into a month-long trip by the father and son to the Philippines, where there's been a decades-long Islamist insurgency in the south of the country.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said last week that the\u00a0attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City told CBS News the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Authorities have charged Akram with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to the wounded survivors and one count of committing a terrorist act.",
      "The antisemitic attack at the start of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration was Australia's worst mass shooting since a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "The New South Wales government introduced draft laws to Parliament on Monday that Premier Chris Minns said would become the toughest in Australia.",
      "The new restrictions would include making Australian citizenship a condition of qualifying for a firearms license. That would have excluded Sajid Akram, who was an Indian citizen with a permanent resident visa.",
      "Sajid Akram also legally owned six rifles and shotguns. A new legal limit for recreational shooters would be a maximum of four guns.",
      "Police said a video found on Naveed Akram's phone shows him with his father expressing \"their political and religious views and appear to summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack.\"",
      "The men are seen in the video \"condemning the acts of Zionists\" while they also \"adhere to a religiously motivated ideology linked to (ISIS),\" police said.",
      "Video shot in October shows them \"firing shotguns and moving in a tactical manner\" on grassland surrounded by trees, police said.",
      "\"There is evidence that the Accused and his father meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,\" police allege.",
      "An impromptu memorial that grew near the Bondi Pavilion after the massacre, as thousands of mourners brought flowers and heartfelt cards, was removed Monday as the beachfront returned to more normal activity. The Sydney Jewish Museum will preserve part of the memorial.",
      "Victims' funerals continued Monday with French national Dan Elkayam's service held in the nearby suburb of Woollahra, at the heart of Sydney's Jewish life. The 27-year-old moved from Paris to Sydney a year ago.",
      "The health department said 12 people wounded in the attack remained in hospitals Monday.",

      "Thousands of mourners gathered under tight police security at Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Sunday evening to mark a week since two gunmen targeting a Jewish festival killed 15 people. Since then, Australian governments have been galvanized into action on countering antisemitism and tightening already strict national gun controls.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, his predecessors John Howard and Scott Morrison, and Governor-General Sam Mostyn, who represents Australia's head of state King Charles III, were among the dignitaries at the commemoration that drew more than 10,000 people.",
      "\"This has to be the nadir of antisemitism in our country,\" New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies President David Ossip told the crowd. \"This has to be the moment when light starts to eclipse the darkness.\"",
      "The crowd booed Albanese when Ossip acknowledged his presence. Opposition leader Sussan Ley, who had said that a conservative government led by her would reverse a decision made by Albanese's center-left Labor Party government this year to recognize a Palestinian state, was cheered.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at Albanese over the attack on the Hannukah celebration, saying \"your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire.\" Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to link widespread calls for a Palestinian state, and criticism of Israel's military offensive in Gaza following Hamas' 2023 attack, to growing incidents of antisemitism worldwide.",
      "A national Day of Reflection to honor the victims",
      "Images of the victims, aged 10 to 87, were projected at the commemoration. \"Waltzing Matilda\" was sung in honor of the youngest victim, whose Ukrainian parents gave their Australian-born daughter what they described as the most Australian name they knew.",
      "A widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, Ahmed al Ahmed, sent a message of support from his hospital bed. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the Syrian-born immigrant was\u00a0seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker. On Tuesday, Albanese said \"Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",
      "\"The Lord is close to the broken-hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters,\" he wrote.",
      "His father, Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed, was invited to light a candle on the Jewish candelabrum known as a menorah on the final night of Hannukah.",
      "Beyond the famous beach, people around Australia united with Sydney's stricken Jewish community by lighting candles and observing one minute of silence at their homes at 6:47 p.m. to remember the moment the massacre unfolded. Television and radio networks across Australia also fell silent.",
      "The federal and New South Wales state governments declared Sunday a national Day of Reflection to mark Australia's worst mass shooting since 35 died in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "Albanese had earlier announced a review of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies following last week's attack, which was inspired by the Islamic State group.",
      "Indigenous leaders held a traditional smoking ceremony on Sunday morning at the waterfront Bondi Pavilion, where an impromptu memorial has grown as flowers and heartfelt messages have accumulated. The memorial is to be cleared on Monday.",
      "Mostyn, the governor-general, accepted an invitation from the National Council of Jewish Women for women of all faiths to lay a flower at the memorial on Sunday morning. Hundreds of women and girls dressed in white joined her in making the gesture.",
      "She later delivered a message from the British monarch saying he and Queen Camilla were \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic attack on Jewish people the Hannukah celebration on Bondi Beach.\"",
      "Tight security at Bondi Beach",
      "One of the suspects, Naveed Akram, 24, was shot by police. He has been charged with 15 counts of murder and 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to those wounded. His father, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene.",
      "The Health Department said 13 of those wounded at Bondi remained in Sydney hospitals on Sunday.",
      "Police bolstered security around Bondi on Sunday, including officers armed with rifles. There was criticism that the first police responders last week were armed only with Glock pistols, which did not have the lethal range of the assailants' shotguns and rifles. Two police officers were critically wounded.",
      "Flags flew at half-staff on the Sydney Harbor Bridge and government buildings, which were lit in yellow on Sunday night in a show of solidarity with the Jewish community.",
      "Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief Alex Ryvchin said the victims' families felt \"tragically, unforgivably let down\" by government failures to combat a growth in antisemitism in Australia since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023.",
      "A day after the attack, an emergency meeting of federal and state leaders committed to tightening national gun laws with measures including limiting the number of guns an individual can own. Sajid Akram legally owned six guns, including the two shotguns and two bolt-action rifles used at Bondi.",

      "The winter solstice is when the sun makes its shortest, lowest arc, but many celebrate it as a time of renewal because after Sunday, the sun starts climbing again and days will get a little longer every day until late June.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, good morning to you.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We took you literally. You said last Sunday you'd come back and talk to us about that household survey, the jobs picture. You said you really trust it. That report came out. It showed America added 64,000 jobs, with unemployment ticking up to 4.6%. But we've seen analysis, including from the top economist at us, navy, federal, saying the US is in a quote, hiring recession. Very few jobs being added since the spring, and wage gains are slowing. Are we in a hiring recession?",
      "HASSETT: No, I don't think so. I think that basically, the number was about what the market expected. It was a number that was less than 100 which is a little bit lower than you'd like. But then after that, we got the consumer price index numbers, which were really amazing. And so if you look at the three month moving average of core consumer prices, then they're running at an annual rate of about 1.6% way below the Fed's target. And my old friend, all the way back to grad school, Austin Goolsby, is now one of the Fed governors voting on interest rates, conceded that they should have cut rates faster and that he's going to do so in the future because of this inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was one of the dissenters when the Fed's decision came out. But when it comes to inflation, as you just referred to, that number showed there was still a rise in inflation, it was just at a slower pace than expected. If you pull out energy and pull out food, it rose at the slowest pace since 2021 up 2.6% in November from a year ago. But then there are quirks in here, because it looks like the prices weren't gathered until Thanksgiving discounts kicked in. There was no increase reflected in terms of housing costs. Why do you trust the data now, when you haven't in the past?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, you know, I think that you're right to always be suspicious about data, and it'll look a lot cleaner when we get a full survey, which we didn't have this time. But you know, two of the three numbers, if we go back to the three month moving average, we're fine. And so I think that the error band around the 1.6% inflation, about that's the pace it's running is probably pretty tight. Surely there will be supervisions, but I think the numbers are about right, and I usually, Margaret, don't like to go to year over year when we're talking about what's going on with inflation, because that includes a lot of high inflation Biden months in the back, and fewer and fewer as we get further into the year. But I think that the trajectory right now is best seen by the three month moving average, and that's below two, below the Fed target. So it means the Fed, as Austan Goolsbee said, has plenty of room to cut rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President said inflation has stopped. You'd acknowledge that's an exaggeration.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I guess the inflation being above the target has stopped, for sure, and so, but inflation is not zero Also, that's fair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, he did not give those caveats. He just said inflation has stopped. But Kevin, Kevin Hassett, stay with us. I've got to take a quick break, and I want to talk about the rest of what we've learned. On the other side of it. We've got more questions. Stay with us.",
      "PART 1 ENDS",
      "PART 2 STARTS",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation, and we continue our conversation now with the Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett. This past week, we saw the President announce further changes to immigration policy. He halted diversity visas. There are now 39 countries on this travel ban or restricted list. This is in addition to all the deportations and revocations of asylum. The business community has made clear that the constant changes make it hard for them to plan, particularly in the small business category. They're concerned about a labor shortage and we've seen the U.S. workforce lose more than 1 million foreign-born workers in the past year. Are you hearing those concerns from the business community?",
      "HASSETT: Actually, it's the opposite. So in the sense that native-born workers are up more than 2 million. And so what we've seen is that as foreign-born workers, and a lot of them, don't forget, were illegal immigrants that have been deported, that when foreign-born workers depart, then it creates jobs for people who are native-born. The interesting thing too, which I'd like to remind everybody, is that native-born Americans aren't necessarily racially distinct at all.\u00a0 And so the majority of the native-born jobs that have been created over the last year are Hispanic Americans. It's, you know, just basically taking folks that are legally in the country and getting the jobs to them is what we see in the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Associated General Contractors of America didn't say they're replacing those workers easily. They're saying they're having a hard time doing that, and issued a statement saying it's a significant challenge, urging the administration to look at ways to expand the construction workforce and allow more people to lawfully enter the country.",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things we're seeing, this is exactly how markets work. Right? So construction workers, their salaries this year have gone up by $3,300 on average, according to the latest report --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because the scarcity?",
      "HASSETT: Well, but when the price goes up, then people say, oh, I should go and I used to be a construction worker, but now I'm doing something else. I should go back to construction work because the salaries are so high. And so we're seeing a lot of that go on. And so we're very bullish on construction, and really happy to see that wages are going way back up. And so instead of having, you know, basically illegal people come in and take jobs away from native-born Americans at low wages, we're seeing people reenter the labor force at high wages.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear from the business community part of the question is\u00a0 what is legal? Because you're changing the definition and pulling back asylum from some groups. So there's confusion at the constant change in policy. Will there be clarity in the new year?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, there will definitely be clarity in the new year. And I think there's clarity now that what we've done is that we've made it so that people are legally residents of the country and legally allowed to work, that they're, you know, basically top of the list when you're looking for somebody to hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you a bit about tariffs. Since as far back as July, we have heard the president refer to this idea of $2,000 checks being given out to households. The Treasury secretary said this would go to households making less than $100,000. Should Americans plan to receive those checks in 2026?",
      "HASSETT: That's going to depend on what happens with Congress. Congress is going to have to send those money to those peoples. But the thing we can say is that since July, we've had a lot of positive news about the economy. We've had a couple of quarters of almost 4% growth. We've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row. The deficit relative to last year, is down by $600 billion and so in the summer, I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that, but now I'm pretty sure that there is, and so I would expect that in the new year, the President will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So a new proposal for these, it's not necessarily coming from existing tariff revenue?",
      "HASSETT: Well, it could come from from tariff revenue, but in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those monies. That's an appropriation. And so this would have to be money that would be an appropriation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So don't bank on it, in other words. So are you projecting that in the new year certain tariffs will remain in place, or do you see some of them going away?",
      "HASSETT: I think that most of the tariffs that we've passed this year have proven their mettle. We've got still high growth, which people said we couldn't if we had tariffs. We have reduction in the deficit. Reduction in the trade deficit. Imports from China are the lowest they've been since China entered the WTO. So there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space. But there are also things that we're hearing when we talk to people like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S.. There are also things that maybe could be adjusted. You saw that we decided to exempt coffee, for example, because we don't make a lot of coffee in the U.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And coffee prices are up.",
      "HASSETT: And I think that if there's something that's not made in the U.S. at all, that there's an appetite, and Jamieson Greer is leading the effort to study these matters, that there's an appetite to exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S. because of, you know, like climate or things like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also go got the Supreme Court decision pending in terms of the specific IEEPA, as they're called, these are tariffs where the justification was citing fentanyl, Canadian crude, some Chinese imports. If the Supreme Court doesn't find in your favor, who gets the refund? Is it the companies, or is it the consumers? How does that work?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, we really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us, and I also think that if they didn't find with us, that it's going to be pretty unlikely that they're going to call for widespread refunds, because it would be an administrative problem to get those refunds out to there. But basically, whoever paid the tariff, like, actually cut the check to buy the thing, would be the person who would be getting the refund, if there were one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't the administration claim it was the country that paid that? You're saying the company.",
      "HASSETT: It would be- like, I'm not talking about the incidence, right? That like, so the incidence of the tariff. So in the end, who pays the tariff depends on elasticities of supply and demand, and we know that China cut the price a lot, so that the post tariff price from Chinese goods is about what it was before the tariff. But the people who pay the tariff, if there is a refund, the people who actually paid for the good, the importer, in most cases, they're the ones who would be the first line of defense for refunding the tariff. But I really, really don't think that's going to happen, it'd be very complicated. And then that person would be responsible for allocating the tariff refund to the appropriate folks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a mess.",
      "HASSETT: Yes, it is a mess, and that's why I think the Supreme Court wouldn't do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait and see. I want to quickly ask you about the oil market. I asked you last Sunday about that decision to seize a tanker off the coast of Venezuela. We saw yet another one over the weekend. You said last Sunday, it probably won't affect oil prices to be taking this oil off the black market. Do you stand by that? And was all that oil going to China?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, you know, I haven't been briefed on the latest. I did see that this is another ship that was basically operating in the black market. And so there have been a little bit, there's been a little bit of black market activity in the oil sector to go to sanctioned countries and to get them some oil. And they're getting that oil in order to avoid the reforms that we think would make countries a better place. And so it's not a lot of oil compared to world supply. And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships. There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were these sanctioned ships going to China?",
      "HASSETT: I'm not sure where they were going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Kevin Hassett, thank you for your time--",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have a great holiday. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Paul S. Coakley, President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Oklahoma City Archbishop, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Father, I want to ask you about this role you have at the head of the conference of bishops. Last month, there was this urgent message. It was a very rare statement addressing concern for the evolving situation impacting migrants, and the language was pretty sharp in it. Quote, \"We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.\" What are bishops that you talk to seeing in parishes all around the country? What triggered this?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I think it varies from place to place, for sure. So in communities with a more dense migrant population, there is a great deal of fear and uncertainty, anxiety because of the level of rhetoric that is- that is often employed when addressing issues around migration and the threats of deportation. So there's a lot of anxiety, so our pastors are trying to accompany people, walk with people, reassure people, and that's the message of the Church. And that was the reason for our special message in November, that we're with you. We hear you, we're aware of your suffering or your fears, and we fully intend to accompany you during this difficult time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know there have been bishops in places like Charlotte, in parts of California, who have formally granted permission, or dispensation is the word used, for people to skip Sunday mass if they're afraid they could be targeted by ICE. Are you actually seeing a decline in the number of people attending mass because they're afraid they'll be arrested?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: We're not seeing that here in in Oklahoma. And I haven't heard it reported widely from my brother bishops. So I know that that is the case in some, some places, but I don't think it's as common, at least here locally or in places that I have personal contact with. There's a- there's an anxiety, there's a fear, but I don't think it's kept people away in great numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this video that you released really got a lot of attention. It certainly got ours, and it mentioned being troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship as well as hospitals and schools. You know, I spoke to the Vice President JD Vance last year and asked him about this change in policy that would allow for ICE to enter churches and schools. And he really pushed back hard. He says that the Catholic Church receives funds to help resettle immigrants. Thus they are motivated by financial and not humanitarian reasons. Have you had any kind of conversation with the Trump administration, with the Vice President to explain what it is you're trying to say?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I have not had any personal conversations at this point with either the president or the vice president, so I look forward to engaging with them over matters of mutual concern, and certainly, undoubtedly the question of immigration is going to come up. I think we have opportunities to work together. We have opportunities to speak frankly with one another, so I will look forward to that in the near future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Vice President calls himself a devout Catholic, which is also why I ask. I mean, do you- what do you say to Catholics like him who argue that these hard line immigration policies have had a result that they sought, that the end justifies the means.",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I don't think we can ever say that the end justifies the means. We have to treat everyone with respect, respect of the human dignity, dignity of every person. There is no conflict necessarily between advocating for safe and secure borders and treating people with respect and dignity. We always have to treat people with, with dignity, God-given dignity. The state doesn't award it, and the state can't take it away. So it's, it's from the Creator. So I think as Christians, as believers, we- that's kind of a foundational bedrock thing for us, that people are to be respected and treated with dignity, whether they are documented or undocumented, whether they are here legally or illegally, they don't forfeit their human dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what is it that you think is causing that to be an issue right now? Why do you think that there is a loss of dignity? Are there specific policies that you are thinking of when you say that?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, not necessarily. I mean, I- just to treat people with respect, to afford them due process. The deportations that are, that are happening around the country can- it's instilling, as I said, fear in a rather widespread manner. So I think that's, that's something that concerns us all, that people have a- have a right to live in, in security and without fear of random and deportations. I think we're believers, of course, in due process. We have provisions in law that award due process to, to everyone. So that's what we are wanting to emphasize.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would you advise others, other people of faith, to do for these immigrants?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, we are a nation of immigrants ourselves. So I think that's something that we as Americans need to always come back to. We are founded upon the immigrant experience. So I think we need to be generous in welcoming immigrants. We certainly have a right and a duty to respect borders of our nation. And I would say, remind all of us that we have a right and a duty to respect sovereign borders of a state, but, but we also have a responsibility to welcome migrants. This is kind of a fundamental principle in, in Catholic social teaching regarding immigration and migration. People have a right to to remain in their homeland, but, but they also ought to be allowed to migrate when conditions in their homeland are unsafe and necessitate moving to a place where they can find peace and security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City, thank you for your time today.",

      "RUSSELL: Well, Sudan is, at this moment, the largest humanitarian crisis we're facing. And there are many things happening there. One is that children, in particular, but people are on the move. Millions of people are moving around the country. We have hunger, extreme hunger, including famine designated in certain parts of the country. We're also seeing just horrific levels of violence- excuse me, including rape, including against children. UNICEF did a report about that about a year ago, even children under the age of one. Absolutely terrible stories. And a woman I met in Chad who had fled Darfur told me about the effort to sort of rape women in front of their families and their communities, really trying to terrorize them and videotaping it to humiliate them. And so the levels of violence are horrific. We have children out of school. So the bottom line here is that the needs are enormous. The challenges are just absolutely staggering. And I think the world needs to come together. You know, in the short term, for sure, we need better humanitarian access. We need to reach all of these communities, \u00a0that's hard to do right now. But the truth is Margaret that what I heard from children across Sudan was the same thing, which is, I would say to them, you know, what do you think about? What do you want? And they all said the same thing, which is, we want peace. I think they understand that the only answer here, really, is to solve the political problems so that people can get back to some sort of a decent life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I just, I don't want to let go what you just mentioned, in terms of why something like that would be done to children and to women in front of their families. The term genocide is used in Sudan. What you are describing there in terms of treatment of gender based violence, it sounds like you are saying that is an attempt to destroy a society by carrying out rape.",
      "RUSSELL: I mean, there are definitely atrocities that are intended to terrorize communities, to force them to move, to scare them. And you know, they're effective strategies for sure. And I think you know the world needs to take a look. I mean, Sudan, I know it seems so far away, and it is in many ways, but it is also a place where children are suffering so enormously. And I think especially, you know, now we're in the holiday season, you know, you want to think about, you know, people being with their families all the rest of it. I mean, children in so many places are not- are not having those sort of luxuries. They are really suffering. And I think the world needs to pay attention to that. And I commend, you know, Senator Rubio- Secretary Rubio, now for pointing this out, because I think the key thing here is that we need attention to the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. has historically been the largest donor to UNICEF, but we've seen tremendous cuts by this administration, including a $142 million claw back of congressionally approved funds. Secretary Rubio said no one died from these aid cuts, and on Friday, he said he's very proud of the changes that were made in foreign aid. Tell us what the reality is of the funding cuts.",
      "RUSSELL: The funding cuts are challenging. And I think the issue to understand is it's not just the United States. It's almost every donor to- certainly to UNICEF, but to the UN system broadly, and to the humanitarian sector. And so when you add all of those together, the impacts are really dramatic, because it means that you know what- what financial support we do get, we have to spread now over- over more places, and with less support from- from donor countries. So I think you know there are, certainly, you know, there have been and will probably always be catastrophes that we're trying to deal with, and children are suffering. The United States has always proudly led, I think, on humanitarian response and on helping children. And, you know, we're hopeful that some of the money that has been taken back will be restored to us. We continue to work with the State Department. There are efforts to fund a lot of the humanitarian and sort of life saving work that we do. But really, you know, the needs around the world are just absolutely enormous, and it's the United States and other donors who have to come in behind that, along with the private sector, I have to add that that is also important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I should point out that the U.S. is one of the largest foreign aid donors to South Sudan, but that foreign aid is also under threat at this moment because of the government not complying with what the U.S. is demanding. Let me quickly--",
      "RUSSELL: --South Sudan is a challenge. I was just there too, and that is, you know, the government there needs to do a better job",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly before I let you go. Gaza, how are things improving?",
      "RUSSELL: Well, again, I would say, thanks to the ceasefire and the administration here was critical on doing that, things have gotten a bit better. We are able to move around better. But, you know, there's tremendous misery. The challenges remain. We have a lot of work that needs to get done. I mean, you've seen all of the images, the destruction. You know, we still have serious level- levels of malnutrition. We are trying to get shelter in place. You know, there's rain and just misery for children all around. So I think, you know, I would say there definitely is progress with the ceasefire. God willing that holds, and then we can continue to get more and more aid in there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: God willing that holds, as you say. Catherine Russell, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by two House members who pushed their colleagues into passing the bill to release these documents. Republican Thomas Massie, who is in Garrison, Kentucky, and Democrat Ro Khanna, who joins us this morning from Palo Alto, California. It's good to have both of you here. I want to start with you, Congressman Massie, because in these past 48 hours, we have seen the Justice Department acknowledge it's an incomplete release, but they have put out more than 13,000 files. They say more will come. This isn't everything you asked for just yet, but would you acknowledge that they are complying with this spirit, if not the intent of your law?",
      "REP. THOMAS MASSIE: No, they're flouting the spirit and the letter of the law. It's very troubling the posture that they've taken. And I won't be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied. You know, I said in the hours leading up to this release that we will know if they are complying, if they implicate any of the other criminals that are involved and the suspects that are involved. The witnesses this- the victims themselves, have given to the FBI, and they've never been mentioned.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are some disclosures in here that seem new. Congressman Khanna. The documents confirm that the FBI received a complaint about Jeffrey Epstein back in 1996 but the woman, whose name is Maria Farmer who made that complaint, said federal officials failed to follow up. She said the disclosure makes her feel redeemed, and that this was one of the best days of her life to see these documents made public. What action do you want taken around a case like this?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: That was the single most important disclosure of what we got. I know Maria's sister. She sounded the alarm in 1996, she complained to the FBI. The problem is that Epstein was so connected with law enforcement and powerful politicians, the FBI did nothing for a decade. Frankly, she deserves compensation. She deserves an explanation, but the broader point is, Blanche was on this morning saying that Massie and I have a problem, that it's taking too long. That's not the problem. The problem is, this was a slap in the face of survivors. What do they want? They want to know who are the rich and powerful men who visited Epstein's rape island and covered up the abuse and the key documents that our law basically said needed to be released. The 60-count indictment that actually implicates a lot of these people and the prosecution memo were not released. It's not about the timeline, it's about the selective concealment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yet. Right? The Deputy Attorney General said there are more disclosures that will be made. You believe that they will not release that particular part? You did give them some leeway for redactions.",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, first of all, the redactions were excessive. And even Harvard Law professors who have looked at that have said, you can't redact internal communications, you can't redact workforce product, and the courts are going to find that these were excessive. But my point, and I'm sure Congressman Massie can elaborate, is that we want the files out. So if our sounding the alarm on what is missing is going to help them get those files out, fine. But this shouldn't be a big document dump. There's a pretty simple point, who raped these young girls who covered it up, and why are they getting away with it?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying specific things regarding the indictment. Congressman Massie, I saw in a video that you posted, you had a very specific benchmark of success here. You said, you know there are at least 20 men accused of sex crimes known to the FBI. How do you know that number? And do you know those names?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Yeah, the survivors' lawyers have told me those numbers, and they've described their professions and in general, but they've only given me one of those names, and I mentioned that in a congressional hearing, Jess Staley. So I searched these documents, I didn't see Jess Staley's name, nor did I see 19 other names. And here's why we shouldn't be optimistic that Blanche or Bondi are going to release these things. They sent a six page memo to Congress and said- they cited pre-existing laws as reasons that they weren't going to follow our law. For instance, our law requires them to release information regardless of embarrassment, but they are trying to say that a previous law prevails when it doesn't. Common sense says it doesn't, the Privacy Act doesn't protect them from that. And then also, as Ro said, internal communications those they're using a FOIA standard that doesn't apply because our law already says they have to give us internal communications",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the gentleman there you referenced as accused. I mean being in the document doesn't necessarily prove criminal behavior right? In terms of the redactions, what the Deputy Attorney General said is that they were abiding by your law, and also a judge in New York had ordered them to listen to victims. So they're claiming that information that they had initially even published Friday they had to pull down because they were trying to protect victims. You aren't- you don't sound convinced that they are abiding by, you know, this intent?",
      "REP. MASSIE: No, they are not abiding. And all three judges who released the grand jury material said that our law trumps the prior law. That's just common sense. Law school 101. Yet Todd Blanche is using a different theory that wouldn't survive first contact with any court, which is he's trying to say that prior laws override our law. That's not the way this works.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : Okay, what are you going to do about it, to force them to comply? I mean, can you do anything?",
      "REP. MASSIE: Oh, absolutely. Look, people have talked about- and by the way, Todd Blanche is the face of this, but it's really the Attorney General's Office, Pam Bondi, who is responsible. And there are several ways to get at this. Some take longer. Some are shorter. The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts and give her and, and- basically Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, well, I mean, on another network this morning, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said, impeachment or contempt, it is premature, Congressman Khanna. And the Deputy Attorney General said, \"bring it on.\" They don't seem to be taking this very seriously. And if you just don't have the math in the Senate, including, at least now this Democratic senator not being convinced, doesn't that sort of show that you're at the limit of pressure?",
      "REP. KHANNA: No, we only need the House for inherent contempt, and we're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents. I'll tell you why, I've talked to the survivors, why this is such a slap in the face. One of the survivors said they released her name accidentally, but they still have not released the FBI file about the people who abused her at her request. And the problem here is that there are rich and powerful people. We all know this. There are 1,200 victims. They're rich and powerful people who either engaged in this abuse, covered it up or were on this island. And what the American people want to know is, who are these people? And instead of holding them accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law. And this is the corrupt system, the Epstein class that people are sick of. So I believe we're going to get bipartisan support in holding her accountable, and a committee of Congress should determine whether these redactions are justified or not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometime in January, when you all come back. I assume that- that will happen. I want to ask you though Congressman Khanna, there have been images released in the past 48 hours. Some of them include former President Bill Clinton. There's at least one image of Donald Trump. I should say neither man has been accused of any wrong doing related to Epstein, though they clearly knew him. But since Friday's publication, we're showing the image here now. One of the pictures was pulled down. There were 15 images total that were then redacted from the DOJ website. And it's-\u00a0 it's kind of hard to see, but it's an open drawer with a photo of President Trump. Why do you think that was pulled down? Because the Deputy Attorney General says this was victims saying that their privacy or somehow their integrity was being compromised by having that image published.",
      "REP. KHANNA: Well, I'm less concerned about that photo. I don't know the facts. My concern is the major documents that we know are out there that haven't been released, the 60-count indictment that shows massive financial fraud and foreign interference, the prosecution memo and look--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Foreign interference?--",
      "REP. KHANNA: --They put out these Bill Clinton pictures- Well, they- there are allegations that there are foreign governments that potentially were involved. And that all needs to come out. And it needs to come out in the indictments, it needs to come out in the prosecution memos. But the reality is, they put out these pictures for Bill Clinton. Fine, put it all out. But don't distract from the fundamental issue, which is, who are these powerful people who were visited rape- the rape island? I mean, they're 1200 victims. It defies common sense that it was just Epstein and- and Maxwell, and they're hiding something. And you know why the American people are so upset? My X account had MAGA supporters supporting me for the first time, saying, you know, Pam Bondi whiffed, according to Susan Wiles, she is breaking the law. She needs to be held accountable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to the Vanity Fair quote that the chief of staff gave, saying the \"whiffed,\" and she said that Pam Bondi gave them \"binders full of nothingness.\" And then when it came to the client list, she said it was on her desk. \"There is no client list,\" quote \"and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.\" Do you see that as an acknowledgement here, though, that, that the politics have overtaken the substance?",
      "REP. KHANNA: No, for us, it's about the survivors. And if you look at Thomas Massie and my comments, the morning of the release, we were giving t- Blanche the benefit of the doubt. We said, if it's not all there, fine, just get the information out. It's when the survivors said that this is an insult, this is a slap in their face that we aren't getting the truth about who these men were on the - on rape island, that we started sounding the alarm. And this is more documents of nothingness. And I guess the question the American people have even to me, is, is the system so corrupt, is the system so corrupt that Thomas Massie and you defy the odds, pass a bill through a discharge petition, get the Senate, get the president to sign it, and still, these rich and powerful people are being protected. Who has this kind of hold on our government? What are they hiding? Why are they not releasing this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you want what people involved in those initial investigations down in Florida, re-examined and possibly prosecuted?",
      "REP. KHANNA: I want the information out which was in that prosecution memo that Acosta disregarded, that were in those indictments, that there were 60 counts against Epstein, only two counts were prosecuted. I want to know who were these other people who were on the Epstein's rape island, who were the people who saw young girls being paraded around at parties, 13,14,15 year olds, and didn't say anything. And why- why is it so hard when there's a law requiring these names to come out? What we're seeing is survivors' names come out, but not the men who abuse them. And instead of, instead of holding elites accountable, Pam Bondi is breaking the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when you gentlemen come back to work sometime in January, what your next measures are. It sounds like you've made it clear you're moving action against the Attorney General. Thank you both for your reaction today, Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

Settlements are widely considered illegal under international law.",

Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      "HASSETT:\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And voice should be heard is going to be--",
      "HASSETT: You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      "HASSETT: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks as always. We'll be right back.",

    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel \u2014 especially under foot \u2014 and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen \u2014 a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled \u2014 a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-sourced sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

    "title": "Arctic temperatures rising twice as fast as elsewhere, NOAA report says",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arctic-temperatures-climate-change-noaa-report/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 10:02:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Temperatures in the Arctic continue to follow a long-term warming trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic just experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began more than a century ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Rising temperatures in the polar region show no signs of leveling off, either, according to the agency, which said they are rising twice as fast as overall global temperatures.",
      "NOAA reviewed how the Arctic is faring in a warming world in the latest iteration of its annual Arctic Report Card.",
      "\"To observe the Arctic is to take the pulse of the planet,\" reads the report's executive summary. \"The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples. Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.\"",
      "Since the previous year's report card, climate change has continued to impact the Earth's northernmost area even more than the rest of the planet, NOAA said. The latest report details some of the most concerning developments observed over the last year, with scientists noting \"a clear pattern of Arctic warming.\"",
      "During the observational period, from October 2024 to September 2025, average sea surface temperatures measured in the Arctic were higher than the 1991-2020 average by as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. Those were the warmest sea surface temperatures observed in the Arctic since at least 1900, signaling an intensifying climate pattern for the region.",
      "In March, Arctic winter sea ice hit its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47 years of satellite data collection, and six months later, the ice reached its 10th lowest annual minimum. \"All of the 19 lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the last 19 years,\" the report noted.",
      "Air temperatures increased, too. The autumn season of 2024 was the warmest on record, and the winter of 2025 ranked as the second-warmest, the report card said. Scientists also determined that Arctic temperatures since 2006 have increased at more than double the rate of global temperature changes. They have been warning for years that climate change is heating up the northern polar region more dramatically than anywhere else.",
      "Vital ecosystems are being transformed as a result of the Arctic's persistent warmth, according to the report card. The heat is accelerating sea ice loss and glacier melt while transforming the region's landscapes. Its tundra, for example, has been turning green as thawed permafrost and longer summers give foliage more opportunities to grow.",
      "Scientists emphasize that what happens to the Arctic directly affects the rest of the world, especially as sea ice minimums have continued to drop. Glaciers in Scandinavia saw their largest annual loss of ice on record between 2023 and 2024, and the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an estimated 129 billion tons of ice in 2025, according to NOAA, continuing an ongoing trend.",
      "\"Ongoing glacier loss contributes to steadily rising global sea levels, threatening Arctic communities' water supplies, driving destructive floods and increasing landslide and tsunami hazards that endanger people, infrastructure, and coastline,\" NOAA's report said.",

      "HERE IS WHAT\u2018S IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE\u2019S LATEST EPSTEIN FILES DROP",
      "\"Epstein was a highly skilled manipulator and Andrew a blithering idiot/ buffoon. Epstein needed Andrew's monied circle of friends. It gave him status and a platform to grow his vile empire. Entitled Andrew with the promise of sex, money and friendship was hoodwinked into believing Epstein was his friend,\" Chard said.",
      "\"Epstein was a highly skilled manipulator and Andrew a blithering idiot/ buffoon.\"",

      "A photo of Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell found in the Justice Department's latest release of Epstein files. (Department of Justice)",
      "\"What stands out most to me is the context of these images, not just their content. Seeing Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell appear in settings directly tied to royal life (particularly Sandringham and Royal Ascot) underscores how close Andrew allowed them to come to the monarchy\u2019s central spaces. Sandringham is one of the family\u2019s most intimate hideaways, and Ascot is one of its most visible social stages. Access to both goes\u00a0well beyond casual association,\" Matta began.",

      "\"That\u2019s why Tina Brown\u2019s description of Andrew as a 'useful idiot' remains so apt. Epstein and Maxwell didn't need\u00a0Andrew to consciously facilitate anything to benefit from him. His title alone granted status and legitimacy. Being seen with a senior royal opened doors,\" Matta told Fox News Digital.",

      "She said that these photos are devastating to the monarchy.",
      "\"For an institution that must be seen as dignified and above scandal, the idea that Epstein and Maxwell were able to move so freely through royal-adjacent spaces is a nightmare and dulls the shine,\" Matta said.",
      "She continued, \"Andrew's\u00a0public role is already effectively over, so the real question is how long the monarchy will remain burdened by the consequences of his connections.\"",

      "Fordwich continued, \"What Andrew\u00a0conferred was something no amount of money could ever buy Epstein and what he craved above all else as well as what perpetuated his power, legitimacy. By bringing Epstein into his sphere of Royal access Andrew sent a signal to others it was acceptable and indeed desired to be with Epstein. Andrew\u2019s presence conferred royal cachet as it was perceived by all as tangibly vouching for Epstein who needed social camouflage.\"",
      "The royal commentator found the images \"disturbing\" for a number of reasons. \"Particularly, from the photo taken at Sandringham with Andrew sprawled across several women\u2019s laps in his mother\u2019s QEII\u2019s private estate, which she so cherished, such betrayal of his family and of the nation all with young girls suffering,\" she said.",

      "When speaking with Peter Lassally, Carson's producer for 22 years, Malkhoff confirmed the infamous \"Tonight Show\" ban list existed. He added that to his knowledge there was never a physical list, but both \"Burt Reynolds and Rich Little both claimed to have seen a 'hard copy' with over thirty names on it.\"",

      "Jay Leno made his \"Tonight Show\" debut in March 1977 and was a smash hit, so much so that he soon became a regular on the show.",
      "Things went wrong, however, after his fifth appearance in February 1978, when \"the audience laughs were so light that Johnny decided never to invite him back,\" according to the book.",
      "\"Tonight Show\" stand-up talent scout Jim McCawley wrote in his unpublished book that producers were told by Carson not to invite Leno back. Malkoff wrote that McCawley tried to fight for Leno, but producer Peter Lassally shut him down.",

      "DeGeneres was reportedly banned for making a joke she was told not to make. (Randy Holmes/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images)",
      "Ellen DeGeneres made history as the first-ever female comedian to be called over to the couch by Carson when she made her first appearance on the show in November 1986.",
      "She returned to the show two more times before upsetting Carson and effectively getting banned for the rest of his tenure as host. According to the show's publicist, Charlie Barrett, Carson told DeGeneres not to make a certain joke during her third appearance in May 1987, but the comedian chose to do so anyway.",
      "\"Barrett was there in the green room after the show when Jim [McCawley] chastised Ellen in front of everyone,\" Malkoff wrote. \"Pointing at her, he said, 'I told you not to do that material.' Barrett recalled Ellen looking embarrassed. Jim made Ellen and her guest leave, saying, 'You won\u2019t be back again too soon.'\"",

      "The \"Star Trek\" actor was unaware of the unwritten rules for guests appearing on the talk show and accidentally broke three. According to the book, Shatner made the mistake of speaking \"monotonously for four minutes straight,\" without letting Carson interject.",
      "\"Second, he turned his back on his host to talk to Buddy Hackett,\" the book states. \"Third, he disregarded the Tonight rule that it was okay to mention your non-NBC TV series but not the network it aired on. Shatner mentioned the show, his series T. J. Hooker, and then also mentioned that it was on ABC. (The word was muted for air.)\"",
      "While Shatner would come back to the show as a guest, it was only with guest hosts, including Jay Leno and Patrick Duffy. Shatner evidently didn't understand why he wasn't asked back, as, according to the book, he later told USA Today that Carson \"would get a hate-on for people\" and decide they would not come back to the show.",

      "That all changed in January 1986, when Sagan corrected Carson twice as the two were discussing Halley's comet.",
      "\"Carson made light of his mistakes. He hid his embarrassment with his affable smile,\" Malkoff wrote. \"Inside, though, he felt slighted. Strange that such a brief exchange carried such a sting, but despite his abiding respect for Sagan, Carson made sure the astrophysicist was not invited back to the talk show that had brought him enviable celebrity status.\"",

      "The comedian had been playing Carson in similar sketches since the late 1980s. Jeff Sotzing, a producer on the \"Tonight Show,\" told Malkoff in the book that Carson wasn't a fan, saying, \"I don\u2019t talk like that. I don\u2019t use those expressions,\" with Sotzing adding he thought they made him \"seem like he was old and confused.\"",
      "Despite his dislike of the sketches, Carson continued to have Carvey on the show until a 1990 sketch that portrayed Carson as \"out of touch, unhip and clueless\" while chatting with his guest and competitor Arsenio Hall.",
      "\"After that, Carvey was permanently banned from Tonight,\" the book says. \"Days after the airing of the offending sketch about him and Ed, during his monologue, Johnny referenced it without mentioning the show.

      "Things changed when Welles told Carson that he would be doing a mentalist routine while guest-hosting the show for the fifth time. While Carson was skeptical, he watched as Welles' trick failed, later finding out that the director had hired two men to sit in the audience to help him. The two messed up, leading to Welles' failure.",
      "\"He wasn\u2019t irate because the trick flopped; he was furious that Orson was dishonest,\" Malkoff wrote. \"A magician using audience plants was inexcusable. The towering figure of world cinema and part-time magician never again appeared as a guest with Carson hosting.\"",

      "After Lewis guest hosted for a week, Malkoff writes that the show's cue card guy, Don Schiff, told Carson he would never be in charge of cards when Lewis was guest hosting. When pressed for a reason, Schiff told Carson, Lewis \"got hysterical [and] verbally abusive\" when Schiff told him he couldn't fulfill his request in time.",
      "\"After hearing the story, Johnny made a quick decision,\" the book says. \"Despite Lewis\u2019s being a giant of American entertainment, Johnny was clear: Lewis would never guest-host or appear on the show again. And other than one brief exception, he never did.\"",

      "Things soured between the two of them in October 1982, the final time Allen guest hosted. Malkoff writes that one of the reasons Allen was banned was because he mocked a previous injury suffered by Carson. In addition, word got back to Carson that Allen was rude to crew members for making changes his associates requested.",
      "Infuriated at the changes his own people had requested, Steve phoned the crew member the next day, yelling at them. Word got back to Johnny. The crew member asked never to work with Allen again. Johnny assured him that he wouldn\u2019t have to, because Allen had been banned.",

      "When speaking with Fox News Digital, Murphy explained that discovery is still ongoing in this case, saying Nick's lawyer, Alan Jackson, \"needs to carefully review as much discoveries as he can get,\" so that he can \"confidently decide\" if his client should \"just plead not guilty\" or to submit a \"guilty by reason of insanity plea.\"",
      "\"So continuing an arraignment, there's nothing unusual about that. And it's also important to remember that Nick Reiner not being transported \u2013 there's no verdict on that. There's no mental health professional that is making that call. The defense has the unilateral ability to, like I said, declare a doubt.

      "\"The defense will then prepare what's known as a live-z packet, or in Los Angeles County, they call it a live z hearing. He's gonna accumulate as much information as he can regarding factors in mitigation,\" he explained. \"In the death penalty analysis, it's about factors in aggravation versus factors in mitigation.

      "About 10% of people with chronic acid reflux will develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a condition where the lining of the lower esophagus is replaced with abnormal cells that are more prone to cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "In most people, the lower esophageal sphincter \u2014 which Gioffre refers to as the \"acid gate\" \u2014 keeps acid in the stomach, which is lined with thick mucus and specialized cells designed to protect it.",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "\"But when the gate gets weak, it relaxes or stays slightly open, and acid slips back up the wrong way,\" he said. This \"gate\" can weaken with magnesium deficiency, high stress, alcohol, poor sleep, dehydration and late-night snacking, all of which can disrupt healthy digestion.",
      "When acid hits the esophagus, it irritates tissue that was never designed to withstand it, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Every time acid comes back up the wrong way, it injures the lining like a slow chemical burn,\" said Gioffre, who is also the author of \"Get Off Your Acid\" and \"Get Off Your Sugar.\" Over time, that irritation erodes the lining, drives inflammation and can change the cells.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",

      "Once the cells start changing, the risk of further mutation goes up. If that process continues, Gioffre warned, it can progress to dysplasia, which is the stage right before esophageal cancer.",
      "Some studies have shown that among those with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, between 3% and 13% will go on to develop cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"So the real danger is not the heartburn you feel,\" he summarized. \"It is the repeated acid exposure forcing the esophagus to adapt in ways it was never designed to. Fixing reflux at the root stops this entire cascade before those cellular changes begin.\"",
      "Men at higher risk",
      "Men generally have a higher risk because they burn through magnesium faster, tend to carry more visceral fat pushing upward on the stomach, eat heavier meals and snack late at night, Gioffre cautioned. These activities all weaken the acid gate and shut down healthy digestion.",
      "THE BREAD THAT KEEPS THINGS MOVING IN THE BATHROOM \u2014 AND DOCTORS SAY IT REALLY WORKS",
      "\"Eating within three hours of lying down almost guarantees the stomach does not empty, and that is one of the biggest drivers of nighttime reflux,\" he said. \"On top of that, men often ignore symptoms, or mask them with PPIs and antacids instead of fixing the root cause.\"",
      "All of these factors contribute to a \"perfect storm\" for chronic inflammation and long-term damage, according to Gioffre.",

      "There are certain red flags that indicate when acid reflux has gone beyond an occasional annoyance and has progressed to constant and chronic.",
      "\"If that burn becomes more frequent or more intense, or starts showing up even when you have not eaten, your body is waving a giant warning flag,\" Gioffre said.",

Now, researchers say a surprising clue may help explain it, a domesticated sheep that lived more than 4,000 years ago.",

      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "When Stephanie got pregnant with her first child at age 32, she channeled her limited energy and finances towards things like preparing space in her home and gathering supplies. The task, and cost, of securing and taking prenatal vitamins fell by the wayside.",
      "As an unemployed mom in Columbia, South Carolina, she\u2019s not alone. The state is home to a high number of women of reproductive age who lack health insurance \u2014\u00a0one in eight to be exact \u2014 and even more who don\u2019t have access to proper prenatal care. The effects can be dire, contributing to birth defects, preterm birth, and even infant and maternal death.",
      "But when Stephanie conceived her second child years later at age 41, she had a leg up: Through a local diaper bank called Power in Changing, she received not just diapers, information, support, and other supplies, but also free prenatal vitamins from the global health nonprofit\u00a0Vitamin Angels. Had the supplements not been free, Stephanie said, she likely would have prioritized something else and skipped them once again. That, fortunately, wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\"With this pregnancy, I took the prenatal and I felt good throughout the whole pregnancy with him\u2026I just overall generally feel healthier,\" Stephanie said. Despite being significantly older, she recovered faster from childbirth too. Stephanie\u2019s second child, she added, \"definitely benefited from having a healthy mom and a healthy start. He\u2019s brought a lot of joy to my life.\"",
      "Prenatal vitamins like those provided by Vitamin Angels are more than nice to have:\u00a0Research shows that pregnant women with inadequate nutrition are more likely to experience complications including post-partum hemorrhage and preterm delivery, and their babies are at higher risk of poor cognitive and physical development.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "\"During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body works overtime to nourish her baby,\" said\u00a0Colleen\u00a0Delaney, PhD, RDN, a researcher and registered dietitian nutritionist who serves as a technical advisor for Vitamin Angels. Simply eating more doesn\u2019t cut it. Moms with so-called \"hidden hunger\" may not lack calories, \"but they are short on the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support their health and their baby\u2019s development,\" Delaney added. \"Prenatal multivitamins are a simple, proven way to meet that need.\"",
      "But social and economic barriers like unemployment and unstable housing can prevent moms-to-be like Stephanie from taking the vitamins regularly. In fact, more than 1 million underserved pregnant women in the US miss out on important prenatal services, including multivitamins and nutrition support.",
      "That\u2019s where Vitamin Angels comes in. Thanks to donations from individuals and corporate partners like the brain supplement brand\u00a0Prevagen (which acts as a philanthropic collaborator and not a prenatal vitamin maker), pregnant women across the country can receive the supplements free of charge. And importantly, the women access them from local providers they already use and trust.",
      "\"Partners like Power in Changing know their community, they know the mothers they serve by name, and they know the support their clients need,\"\u00a0Ana C\u00e9spedes, Vitamin Angels CEO, said. \"We further support their work by giving them more tools \u2014 a proven prenatal multivitamin and nutrition education \u2014 to put into women\u2019s hands when they need it most.\"",
      "From South Carolina to East India",
      "A few states away from Stephanie, a Florida woman named Ty\u2019hara had trouble finding prenatal care options that accepted her Medicaid coverage. But when she discovered Bond Community Health Center, which provides a wide range of health services, she was able to access and take prenatal vitamins from Vitamin Angels diligently.",

      "One of the most widely known risks linked to the COVID-19 vaccine is myocarditis, especially in young males \u2014 and now a new Stanford study has shed some light on why this rare effect can occur.",
      "Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart, occurs in about one in 140,000 people who receive the first dose of the vaccine and one in 32,000 after the second dose, according to a Stanford press release. Among males 30 and younger, that rises to one in 16,750.",
      "Symptoms of the condition include chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and palpitations, which can occur just one to three days after vaccination. Another marker is heightened levels of cardiac troponin, which indicates that the heart muscle has been damaged.",
      "LOWER DEMENTIA RISK LINKED TO ROUTINE VACCINATION IN MAJOR NEW ANALYSIS",
      "In most cases, people who experience myocarditis recover quickly and restore full heart function, according to study author Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, the director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and a professor of medicine and radiology.",
      "One of the most widely known risks linked to the COVID-19 vaccine is myocarditis, especially in young males. (iStock)",
      "\"It\u2019s not a heart attack in the traditional sense,\" Wu told Fox News Digital. \"There\u2019s no blockage of blood vessels as found in most common heart attacks. When symptoms are mild and the inflammation hasn\u2019t caused structural damage to the heart, we just observe these patients to make sure they recover.\"",
      "In rare cases, however, severe heart inflammation can lead to hospitalizations, critical illness or death, Wu noted.",
      "Finding the cause",
      "The new Stanford study \u2014 conducted in collaboration with The Ohio State University \u2014 aimed to determine the reasons for the myocarditis. The research team analyzed blood samples from vaccinated people, some with myocarditis and some without.",
      "They found that those with myocarditis had two proteins in their blood, CXCL10 and IFN-gamma, which are released by immune cells. Those proteins then activate more inflammation.",
      "COVID VACCINE UNDER NEW SCRUTINY AFTER STUDIES REVEAL POSSIBLE HEALTH RISKS",
      "\"We think these two are the major drivers of myocarditis,\" said Wu. \"Your body needs these cytokines to ward off viruses. It\u2019s essential to immune response, but can become toxic in large amounts.\"",
      "In mouse and heart tissue models, high levels of these proteins led to signs of heart irritation, similar to mild myocarditis.",
      "Prevention mechanism",
      "\"One of the most striking findings was how much we could reduce heart damage in our models by specifically blocking these two cytokines, without shutting down the entire (desired) immune response to the vaccine,\" Wu told Fox News Digital, noting that a targeted, \"fine\u2011tuning\" immune approach might be enough to protect the heart.",
      "Myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart, occurs in about one in 140,000 people who receive the first dose of the vaccine and one in 32,000 after the second dose. (iStock)",

      "Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano provides an update on the agency's work on 'The Claman Countdown.'",
      "EXCLUSIVE: The Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) internal watchdog has confirmed that the agency\u2019s publicly reported phone service data was accurate and that performance improved during fiscal year 2025, according to a new audit completed after Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., questioned whether the figures could be trusted.",
      "The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reviewed the SSA\u2019s national 800-number telephone metrics and found that the data the agency released to the public was correct, and that overall service improved during fiscal year 2025, according to a draft audit report provided to agency leadership ahead of public release. The report did not issue any recommendations to the agency.",
      "The review was initiated after Warren expressed concerns in June about long wait times and the reliability of SSA\u2019s phone performance data. She formally requested an audit on July 24, prompting SSA Commissioner Frank J. Bisignano, who serves under President Donald Trump, to agree to an independent review by the watchdog.",
      "The audit found that SSA served 68 million callers during fiscal year 2025, either through live agents or automated systems, a 65% increase from the prior year. Average wait times fluctuated early in the year but improved steadily, according to the audit, ending the fiscal year at roughly seven minutes in September after peaking at about 30 minutes in January.",

      "President Donald Trump poses with Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano in the Oval Office as Trump displays a signed proclamation. (Courtesy of the Social Security Administration)",
      "The metric cited by the agency, known as Average Speed of Answer, measures only the time callers actively wait on hold before speaking to an employee and does not include time spent waiting for callbacks.",
      "\"Last year, people waited 40 minutes on the phone, and now they\u2019re in single digits. We\u2019re doing twice as many calls,\" Bisignano said.",
      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Bisignano said the audit confirmed what agency leadership had been reporting publicly about improvements in service levels.",
      "\"Senator Warren was completely wrong in everything that she was saying, and it\u2019s now been proven out,\" Bisignano said, citing the watchdog\u2019s finding that SSA\u2019s publicly reported telephone metrics were calculated accurately.",

      "The inspector general\u2019s report concluded that SSA\u2019s telephone performance improved during fiscal year 2025 largely because of operational changes, including the rollout of a new cloud-based telecommunications platform, expanded automation and staffing realignments. The platform, implemented in August 2024, allowed SSA to increase call capacity, expand self-service options and monitor performance in real time, according to the report.",
      "The watchdog also confirmed that SSA\u2019s internal data-verification process ensured accuracy by comparing raw data with reported metrics and working with vendors to resolve any discrepancies. The audit found no evidence that the agency misrepresented its national 800-number performance.",
      "Bisignano said improvements were driven by a combination of technology, process changes and workforce adjustments.",
      "The report explains that SSA experienced especially high call volumes between January and March 2025 due to Medicare and tax-related questions, as well as the implementation of the Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, which affected more than 3.2 million beneficiaries.",
      "Despite the surge, the agency reduced average wait times over the course of the year.",

      "Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano responds to criticism that the Trump administration is destroying the social safety net program.\u00a0 (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The audit also found that about 25 million calls during fiscal year 2025 ended without callers receiving service, either because callers disconnected, did not answer callback attempts or encountered busy signals. Those calls were not included in the agency\u2019s wait-time metrics.",
      "Automation played a growing role in absorbing the surge. According to the audit, automated systems handled an average of nearly 2.9 million calls per month in fiscal year 2025, up from about 300,000 per month the year before. Automated services allowed callers to complete common tasks without speaking to a live agent, reducing pressure on phone lines.",
      "The inspector general also reviewed how SSA calculates its Average Speed of Answer metric, which measures the time callers actively wait on hold before speaking to an employee. The audit clarified that callers who accept a callback are counted as having zero active wait time, a methodology that reduces the average but does not include the time callers wait to receive callbacks.",
      "Bisignano said transparency about how the numbers are calculated is essential.",
      "\"We figured out how to leverage technology, process engineering, and human capital,\" he said.",
      "Staffing changes also contributed to the turnaround. Early in fiscal year 2025, the number of employees available to answer national 800-number calls declined by about 13%. By July, SSA began assigning roughly 1,000 field office employees each day to help handle national call volume. The audit found that this coincided with sharp improvements in wait times, with Average Speed of Answer dropping from about 13 minutes in June to roughly 7.5 minutes in July.",
      "The audit did not evaluate service levels or wait times at local Social Security field offices.",
      "Beyond wait times, the audit found that service quality remained high. About 87% of callers who responded to post-call surveys said their issue was resolved on the first contact. The survey results reflect feedback from callers who reached an SSA employee and do not include callers who only used automated services.",
      "Bisignano said the improvements matter most for seniors and beneficiaries who rely on Social Security services.",
      "\"We\u2019re investing in Social Security and servicing the American public at a level they\u2019ve never been serviced before,\" he said. \"We\u2019ll meet you where you want to be met: on the phone, in the field offices or on the web.\"",
      "He added that people who haven\u2019t called the agency recently may be surprised by how much has changed.",
      "\"What would surprise them the most is how quickly they can get their phone call answered,\" he said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Looking ahead, Bisignano said the agency plans to continue expanding digital services and reducing backlogs, including in disability claims, while maintaining accountability through ongoing oversight.",
      "\"Expect us to always have double-digit improvements in every metric we have,\" he said. \"This is just the beginning.\"",
      "The OIG report in full can be read here.",
      "\"The bottom line is that Donald Trump\u2019s Social Security chief lied about call wait times to cover up his customer service mess,\" Sen. Warren said in an email to Fox News Digital. \"This new watchdog report reveals that true wait times were more than three times higher than what Commissioner Bisignano claimed, and tens of millions of callers were simply unable to get help on the phone at all.\"",

      "At 18, Jamie Grohsong was living a dream many young athletes chase for years. He was a three-time all-conference shortstop, a Division I college prospect and a player who lived for the game. Then one Fourth of July night in 2023, everything changed. A firework exploded in his hand. In seconds, Jamie lost his pitching hand, his season and what felt like his entire baseball future. The path he had worked toward since childhood disappeared. For a while, Jamie accepted that reality. Baseball, the sport that shaped his identity, was over.",

      "Jamie Grohsong throws a baseball using a bionic prosthetic hand after losing his pitching hand in a fireworks accident. His return shows how technology can help athletes reclaim what they love. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When technology reopens a closed door",
      "Two years later, Jamie stepped back onto a baseball field wearing something he never imagined using. A bionic prosthetic known as the Ability Hand.",
      "\"The fact that I can feel and sense everything to the finest details opened my mind to the possibility of everything that could actually be done,\" he told CyberGuy.",
      "The goal was not to recreate the past. It was to find out what might still be possible.",
      "Engineers who build advanced prosthetic hands saw Jamie's story and reached out with a simple question. What if he did not have to give up the game entirely? That question started an extraordinary journey that blended grit, patience and cutting-edge engineering.",
      "\"When building the Ability Hand, we prioritized real-life usage,\" Dr. Aadeel Akhtar, founder and CEO of PSYONIC, told CyberGuy. \"While we already put the hand through its fair share of stress tests, baseball is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Baseball is definitely a brutal test for any piece of equipment. Throwing requires precise release timing. Hitting demands force, stability and follow-through. At first, nothing came easily.",
      "Learning how to throw again",
      "Throwing a baseball with a bionic hand is not about raw strength. It is about timing and grip. The Ability Hand uses muscle sensors that detect subtle movements in the arm. During a throw, many muscles activate at once, which can cause the hand to open too early. Early throws slipped away. Some felt right. Others did not.",
      "Instead of forcing the hand to grip harder, the PSYONIC team adjusted the technique. Jamie learned to hold the ball lightly and let momentum release it naturally. Small grip changes made a real difference. Slowly, throws began to land. Then they became repeatable. For Jamie, each clean throw rebuilt confidence that had been missing for two years.",

      "The pitch was not perfect. That never mattered. Standing on a Major League Baseball field with a bionic hand, Jamie proved something bigger than accuracy.

      "\"Swinging a bat was a feeling I didn't think I'd feel again,\" Jamie said.",
      "Engineers discovered that bat placement matters more with prosthetics than with natural hands. When the bionic hand serves as the bottom hand on the bat, impact spreads across the fingers. When it sits on top, stress concentrates on the thumb. Jamie bats left-handed, which placed the prosthetic in a safer position. He told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"I can hit with this thing for sure.\"",
      "Then came the first swings. The sensation was unfamiliar. The contact felt strange. Still, the bat met the ball. One swing turned into another. Soon, balls started flying deep into the field. Then it happened. Jamie sent one over the fence.",
      "A world-first moment",
      "Those swings marked what many believe to be the first documented home runs hit using a multi-articulating bionic hand. For Jamie, it was more than a technical milestone. It was emotional closure and a new beginning at the same time. He was not trying to prove that prosthetics make athletes better. He was proving that they can help people reconnect with what they love. The bionic hand did not replace his identity. It gave him a new way to express it.",

Even so, advanced prosthetics remain expensive and imperfect, and they can break under stress. Because of that, users need time, training and patience to adapt.

      "Scammers steal photos from public social media accounts and manipulate them to create fake proof of life images that fuel fear and urgency. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the fake kidnapping scam works",
      "According to the FBI, scammers usually start with a text message. They claim they have kidnapped a loved one and demand immediate payment for their release. To make the threat feel real, the criminals send an altered photo pulled from social media. The FBI says these images may be sent using timed messages to limit how long victims can examine them. The agency warns that scammers often threaten extreme violence if the ransom is not paid right away. This urgency is designed to shut down rational thinking.",
      "Signs the photo may be fake",
      "When victims slow down and look closely, the altered images often fall apart. The FBI says warning signs may include missing scars or tattoos, strange body proportions or details that do not match reality. Scammers may also spoof a loved one's phone number, which makes the message feel even more convincing. Reports on sites like Reddit show this tactic is already being used in the real world.",
      "Why this fake kidnapping scam is so effective",
      "Virtual kidnapping scams work because they exploit emotion. Fear pushes people to act fast, especially when the message appears to come from someone they trust. The FBI notes that criminals use publicly available information to personalize their threats. Even posts meant to help others, such as missing person searches, can provide useful details for scammers.",

      "A major data breach tied to U.S. fintech firm Marquis is rippling through banks, credit unions and their customers. Hackers broke into Marquis systems by exploiting a known but unpatched vulnerability in a SonicWall firewall, gaining access to deeply sensitive consumer data.",
      "At least 400,000 people are confirmed to be affected so far across multiple states. Texas has been hit the hardest with more than 354,000 residents affected. That number is expected to rise as additional breach notifications are filed.",
      "Marquis operates as a marketing and compliance provider for financial institutions. The company says it serves more than 700 banks and credit unions nationwide. That role gives Marquis access to centralized pools of customer data, which also makes it a high-value target.",

      "A major data breach tied to fintech firm Marquis exposed sensitive banking and identity data for hundreds of thousands of people. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information was stolen in the Marquis cyberattack",
      "According to legally required disclosures filed in Texas, Maine, Iowa, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, hackers accessed a wide range of personal and financial data. Stolen information includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account, debit and credit card numbers. The breach dates back to Aug. 14, when attackers gained access through the SonicWall firewall vulnerability. Marquis later confirmed the incident was a ransomware attack.",
      "While Marquis did not publicly name the attackers, the campaign has been widely linked to the Akira ransomware gang. Akira has previously targeted organizations running SonicWall appliances during large-scale exploitation waves. This was not a routine credential leak.",
      "We reached out to Marquis for comment, and a company spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"In August, Marquis Marketing Services experienced a data security incident. Upon discovery, we immediately enacted our response protocols and proactively took the affected systems offline to protect our data and our customers\u2019 information. We engaged leading third-party cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive investigation and notified law enforcement.",
      "\"The incident was quickly contained, and our investigation was recently completed. It was determined that an unauthorized third party accessed certain non-public information within our network. However, there is no evidence indicating that any personal information has been used for identity theft or financial fraud. We have notified potentially affected individuals.",
      "\"We know our customers place great trust in us, and at Marquis, we take that responsibility seriously by making the protection of their information our highest priority. We are extremely appreciative of the cooperation, understanding, and support of our employees and customers during this time.\"",
      "HOW TO STOP IMPOSTOR BANK SCAMS BEFORE THEY DRAIN YOUR WALLET",
      "Why the Marquis data breach creates long-term identity risk",
      "When a data breach exposes your full identity, the danger does not disappear after the news cycle ends. Unlike a stolen password, this kind of information cannot be changed, which means the risk can stick around for a long time.",
      "\"With a typical credential leak, you reset passwords, rotate tokens and move on,\" Ricardo Amper, CEO and Founder of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, tells CyberGuy. \"But core identity data is static. You cannot meaningfully change your date of birth or SSN, and once those are exposed, they can circulate on criminal markets for years. The breach is a moment in time, but the exposure it creates can follow people for the rest of their financial lives.\"",
      "That is why identity breaches are so dangerous. Criminals can reuse the same stolen data years later to open new accounts, build fake identities or run highly targeted scams that feel personal and convincing. Many attackers now combine this data with AI tools to scale their efforts. As a result, phishing emails, phone calls and even voice impersonations are harder to spot when they reference real details about your bank or account history.",
      "The most likely scams after identity data is stolen",
      "When criminals obtain verified identity data, fraud becomes targeted rather than opportunistic.",
      "\"Once criminals get their hands on rich, verified identity data, fraud stops being a guessing game and becomes a targeted execution,\" Amper said.",
      "The first major threat is account takeover. With enough personal details, attackers can bypass knowledge-based checks, reset passwords, change contact information and abuse accounts in ways that often look legitimate. The second risk is new account fraud. This includes credit cards, loans, buy now pay later services and even new bank accounts. High-quality data helps these applications pass automated systems and manual reviews.",
      "The fastest-growing threat is synthetic identity fraud. Real data, like a Social Security number, is blended with fabricated details to create a new identity that matures over time before a large financial bust.",
      "\"These attacks are hard to catch early because the data being presented is accurate and often reused across multiple institutions,\" Amper noted. \"If your defenses can't reliably tell a real human from an AI-generated impersonation, you are starting every decision from a position of disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Why unpatched firewall flaws pose such a serious threat",
      "Ransomware groups like Akira increasingly focus on widely deployed infrastructure to maximize impact. Firewalls sit at the boundary of trusted networks. When one is compromised, everything behind it becomes reachable.",
      "\"What we're seeing with groups like Akira is a focus on maximizing impact by targeting widely used infrastructure. The strategy remains the same: Find a single weak point that gives access to many downstream victims at once,\" Amper said.",
      "This approach exposes a persistent blind spot in traditional cybersecurity thinking. Many organizations still assume traffic passing through a firewall is safe.",
      "\"When the perimeter device itself is the entry point, static defenses and outdated controls simply can't keep up,\" Amper explained.",
      "Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers and bank details by exploiting an unpatched firewall vulnerability.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How long affected consumers should assume risk remains high",
      "Identity data does not expire. Social Security numbers and birth dates stay the same for life.",
      "\"When core identity data reaches criminal markets, the risk does not fade quickly,\" Amper emphasized. \"Fraud rings treat stolen identity data like inventory. They hold it, bundle it, resell it and combine it with information from new breaches.\"",
      "Warning signs of misuse can be subtle. These include credit inquiries you did not authorize, account recovery alerts from unfamiliar services or phone calls that convincingly mimic a bank's verification process using deepfake voice tools.",
      "\"The most damaging fraud often starts long after the breach is no longer in the news,\" Amper added.",
      "The overlooked impact of identity theft",
      "Financial losses are only part of the damage. Victims often experience a lasting erosion of trust.",
      "Amper says, \"The most overlooked consequence is the psychological toll of knowing that you can no longer trust who is contacting you. Deepfake impersonation turns every phone call, video message or urgent request into a potential attack.\"",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Marquis data breach",
      "When a breach exposes Social Security numbers, bank details and birth dates, the risk does not end with a password reset. These steps focus on protections that reduce long-term identity misuse and help you detect fraud early.",
      "A credit freeze prevents criminals from opening new accounts in your name using stolen identity data. This is critical after the Marquis breach, where full identity profiles were exposed. Freezing credit does not affect your score and can be lifted temporarily when needed. Place a free credit freeze with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion online or by phone. Each bureau must be contacted separately. Once frozen, new credit cannot be opened unless you temporarily lift or remove the freeze using a PIN or account login.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. It adds protection if you are not ready to freeze credit everywhere or want an extra layer on top of a freeze. Fraud alerts last for one year and can be renewed. You only need to contact one credit bureau to place a fraud alert. Equifax, Experian or TransUnion will notify the others for you. Fraud alerts are free and last for one year.",
      "Turn on alerts for withdrawal, purchase, login attempts and password changes across all financial accounts. Real-time alerts can help you catch account takeovers or unauthorized activity before serious damage occurs.",
      "Check statements and credit reports often, even months or years after the breach. Identity data from incidents like this is frequently reused later for delayed fraud. Watch for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or small test charges.",
      "Text message codes can be intercepted or socially engineered. Where possible, switch to app-based or hardware-backed two-factor authentication. These options are harder for attackers to bypass, even when they know your personal details.",
      "Biometrics tied to your physical device add a layer that criminals cannot easily replicate. Face and fingerprint authentication help block account takeovers driven by stolen identity data or AI-powered impersonation.",
      "Reputable antivirus software helps detect malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up attacks that target breach victims. This adds protection against phishing and ransomware tied to identity-based scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

This monitoring is especially useful after breaches like Marquis, where identity data can resurface long after the initial incident.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Be cautious of urgent calls, emails or texts that reference real banking or personal details. Scammers now use accurate breach data to sound legitimate. Hang up and contact your bank directly using the number on your card or official website.",
      "Create or secure online accounts with the IRS, Social Security Administration and your state tax agency. Enable strong authentication and monitor for unexpected notices. Stolen identity data is often used for tax refund fraud or benefit scams long after a breach.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Marquis data breach highlights how dangerous unpatched infrastructure vulnerabilities have become for the financial sector. When a single vendor holds data for hundreds of institutions, the fallout spreads quickly. For you, identity protection is no longer a one-time response. It is an ongoing necessity that can last years beyond the initial breach.",

      "As we head into the last stretch of December (and last-minute gift shopping), your doorstep is probably busier than ever. And if you're anything like me, you're probably also juggling shipping updates, tracking numbers, and \"out for delivery\" alerts from half a dozen retailers.",
      "Unfortunately, scammers know this too, and they've likely been preparing for it all year. Like clockwork, I've already started seeing the usual wave of fake tracking texts hitting people's phones. They look legit, they show up right when you're expecting a package, and they rely on one inescapable truth: during the holiday rush, most of us are too overwhelmed to notice when something feels off.",
      "No need to panic, though. You can still come out ahead of the scammers. I'll show you what to look out for and how you can prevent being targeted in the first place.",

      "Holiday shoppers are being hit with a surge of fake delivery texts designed to steal personal information and account logins. (Photo by Sebastian Kahnert/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What fake delivery text messages look like",
      "Most of these fake shipping texts include a \"tracking link\" that looks close enough to the real thing that you might tap without thinking twice about it. In some cases, like one Maryland woman found out, you may even receive\u00a0fake deliveries with a QR code\u00a0that works in a similar way.",
      "These links usually lead to a spoofed tracking page that looks almost identical to the real thing. It'll ask you to \"confirm\" your login or enter your delivery details. The moment you type anything in, scammers capture it and use it to access your real accounts.",
      "Even worse, the \"tracking link\" may contain\u00a0malware\u00a0or\u00a0spyware, triggering silent installs that can steal passwords, monitor keystrokes, or give scammers remote access to your device.",
      "Red flags that reveal fake shipping and tracking messages",
      "So how can you distinguish between a legitimate message for a delivery you're actually waiting for and one of these scams? Here are the red flags I look for:",
      "Weird or slightly altered URLs. Scammers use domains that look almost right. Except there's usually one extra letter, a swapped character, or a completely unfamiliar extension.Requests for additional payment. Real carriers don't ask you to pay a \"small fee\" to release a package. That's an instant giveaway.A package you're not expecting. If the text is vague or you can't match it to a recent order, pause before you tap anything.Delivery attempts at odd hours. \"Missed delivery at 6:12 AM\" or \"late-night attempt\" messages are usually fake. Carriers don't normally operate like that.Updates that don't match what you see in the retailer's app or email. If Amazon says your package is arriving tomorrow, but a random text says it's delayed or stuck, trust Amazon, not the text.Language that is designed to rush you. Anything screaming \"immediate action required!\" is designed to make you stop thinking and start tapping.",

      "Scammers are sending deceptive tracking links that mimic real carriers, hoping rushed shoppers won\u2019t notice red flags. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "How scammers know your address, phone number, and shopping habits",
      "Scammers don't magically know where you live or what you've ordered \u2014 they buy that information. There's actually an entire industry of data brokers built on collecting and selling personal data. This can include your:",
      "Phone numberHome addressEmailPurchase historyBrowsing patternsRetailers accounts and appsLoyalty programsEven preferred delivery times.",
      "Phone number",
      "Home address",
      "Email",
      "Purchase history",
      "Browsing patterns",
      "Retailers accounts and apps",
      "Loyalty programs",
      "Even preferred delivery times.",
      "These data brokers can sell profiles containing hundreds of data points on you. And they aren't always discerning about who they sell to. In fact, some of them have been caught intentionally selling data to scammers.",
      "Once scammers have those details, creating a convincing delivery scam is no problem.",
      "But scammers can't target what they can't find",
      "I've been very vocal about the importance of keeping personal information under lock and key. And this is just one of the reasons why.",
      "Criminals rely on your personal information to target you with these types of scams. They also need at least a phone number or email address to reach you in the first place.",
      "So your best bet to avoid delivery scams (and, honestly, most other scams year-round) is removing your info from data brokers and people search sites. Doing this will keep your details out of circulation online and out of the wrong hands.",
      "FBI WARNS EMAIL USERS AS HOLIDAY SCAMS SURGE",
      "Fraudsters use spoofed shipping pages and malware to capture passwords and gain access to victims\u2019 devices. (Martin Ollman/Getty Images)",
      "How to remove your personal information from scammers' reach",
      "You can start by looking yourself up online. Searching for different combinations of your name, address, email, and phone number should bring up a bunch of people search sites. Just visit the \"opt-out\" page on each site to request removal of your data.",
      "Private-database data brokers are a bit trickier. They sell data in bulk, usually to marketers and other third parties. So you won't be able to check if they have your information. But if you look into which data brokers operate in your area, you can just send opt-out requests to them all. There's a good chance they'll have your information.",
      "You can also turn to a data removal service. They completely remove the headache from this process and just automatically keep your personal info off data broker sites. If, like me, you don't have the time to keep manually checking data broker sites and sending removal requests every few months (because your data will keep reappearing), a personal data removal service is the way to go.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Holiday delivery scams work because they blend perfectly into the chaos of December shopping. A well-timed text and a familiar tracking link are often all it takes to lower your guard. By slowing down, checking messages directly with retailers, and reducing how much of your personal data is circulating online, you can take away the advantage scammers rely on. A little caution now can save you a major headache later.",

      "How AI photo matching kept the search going",
      "Pam's 11-year-old indoor cat, Grayson, had never been outside alone. She believes he slipped out while she unloaded groceries at their home in Plano, Texas. The moment she realized he was gone, she acted fast.",
      "She said, \"We went up and down the streets day and night. We went online in the neighborhood and on Love Lost. We put up flyers all over the neighborhood. Friends and neighbors were looking for him. I went to the animal shelter, posted him there, and went every day for over a month, hoping to find him.\"",
      "Pam uploaded Grayson's photo to Petco Love Lost right away. She checked her daily match alerts and hoped she would see his familiar face pop up. She told CyberGuy, \"I received match alerts almost every day from Lost Love, but never saw Grayson. His profile had been on their site for over 90 days.\"",
      "The moment everything changed",
      "Missy, a nearby resident, spotted a thin cat in an alley near her home. She brought him inside, took a picture of him and then turned to Love Lost to see if anyone had reported a missing cat like him.",
      "Missy explained how simple the process felt. \"I used Lost Love to reunite them,\" she said. \"I uploaded a photo of the cat that we found, and it was matched through AI with the photo that the owner uploaded.\"",
      "She soon received an AI match alert and learned that the cross street Grayson's owner, Pam, had listed in her lost post was only a mile from her home. Missy contacted Pam right away.",
      "That message changed everything. \"I am sure that if we had not posted his picture and enabled the ability to match the images, we would never have known what happened to Grayson,\" Pam said. \"And we would not have connected with Missy.\"",

      "A long road for an aging cat",
      "Grayson is almost 12 and has never lived outdoors. That made this reunion feel even more emotional, Pam said.",
      "\"I am still amazed at Grayson's journey,\" she added. \"I look at him and cannot believe he made it through those 103 days. He is almost 12 years old, so he is not a young kitty.\"",
      "Pam said she still thinks about what those months were like for him. \"[I] guess I will always wonder where he was and how many stops he made before he reached Missy's loving home,\" she said. \"He must have known she would take care of him. It takes a special person to take the time to reunite a beloved pet with their family. Missy and her family went above and beyond to reunite us with Grayson.\"",

      "What to do if your pet goes missing",

      "Look in closets, garages and under furniture. Walk your street and ask neighbors to check yards and sheds.",
      "Take a clear photo and post it on the site. AI photo matching alerts you when a possible match appears. It also helps others contact you fast.",
      "Shelters update kennels throughout the day. Staff can guide you and help flag your pet's profile. Go often until you get updates.",
      "Use neighborhood apps, local Facebook groups and community forums. Include your pet's photo, last known location and your contact info.",
      "Use a large photo and simple details. Place flyers at busy intersections and near schools, parks and businesses.",

      "How AirTags can help you find a lost pet faster",
      "While tools like AI photo matching are invaluable after a pet goes missing, prevention and real-time tracking can make an enormous difference during the first critical hours. That's where Apple AirTags come in. An AirTag isn't a GPS tracker, but it can still be a powerful recovery tool when used correctly. When attached securely to your pet's collar, an AirTag uses Apple's vast Find My network. That network consists of hundreds of millions of nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs that can anonymously and securely relay the AirTag's location back to you.",
      "If your pet wanders into a neighborhood, apartment complex or busy area, the chances are high that another Apple device will pass nearby and update the location automatically. You won't know who helped, and they won't know it was them, but the location can show up on your map within minutes. For indoor cats or dogs that don't usually roam far, this can be especially helpful. Even a rough location can narrow your search area and save precious time.",
      "Important limits to know: AirTags work best in populated areas. They rely on nearby Apple devices, so coverage may be limited in rural or remote locations. They also don't update continuously like true GPS pet trackers. That's why AirTags should be seen as a backup layer, not a replacement for microchipping or dedicated pet trackers.",
      "How to use an AirTag safely with pets",
      "Use a\u00a0secure, pet-specific AirTag holder that won't break easily.Attach it to a\u00a0breakaway collar\u00a0for cats and dogs to reduce injury risk.Make sure\u00a0Find My notifications are turned on so you get alerts quickly.Combine it with\u00a0microchipping and ID tags for the best protection.",

    "story": [
      "Wandercrafts Personal Exoskeleton is about helping people stand tall, connect with others and live life on their own terms.",
      "Recreational exoskeletons have been popping up for years, but the new IRMO M1 exoskeleton feels like a turning point. This next-generation wearable blends artificial intelligence (AI), a forward-facing camera, LADAR sensors and lightweight robotics to give your legs a serious boost on trails and city streets.",
      "It scans the terrain ahead and predicts how much assistance you will need before your foot lands, rather than waiting to react after impact. The result feels smoother and easier than many older systems that rely mainly on reactive support.",
      "IRMO spun out of research from Beihang University in Beijing. Its team built the M1 to act like an all-terrain, adaptive suspension system for your legs, tuned for real-world walking and hiking conditions. Early backers on its global crowdfunding campaign are already pushing the project toward major funding goals.",

      "NEW EXOSKELETON BUILT TO BOOST ENDURANCE AND CUT FATIGUE",
      "The IRMO M1 reads the terrain ahead and gives your legs the support you need before each step. (IRMO)",
      "How the IRMO M1 exoskeleton boosts your stride",
      "The M1 straps onto your waist and legs with modular fast-release bands. Each leg module weighs between 2.2 and 2.6 pounds. A 1,000 W motor provides up to 45% assist on each stride. IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",
      "Inside the frame sits a nine-axis IMU paired with an AI engine that studies your gait in real time. This lets the M1 fine-tune each push as it learns how you move. That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",
      "Terrain-aware AI that looks ahead while you move",
      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "How to buy the IRMO M1",
      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",
      "Since this is a crowdfunding project, you should review the refund rules, shipping details and risk notes before you back it.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you love the outdoors but feel the strain of long climbs or steep descents, this technology looks to help you reopen trails that once felt out of reach. The M1 could help you hike farther, recover faster and protect your knees on tough routes. It also gives recreational athletes a new tool for strength, balance and endurance.",

      "The IRMO M1 exoskeleton blends robotics and AI into a wearable that is built to expand your range outdoors. Its terrain-aware design separates it from earlier models, and its multimode setup makes it useful for more than hiking. If the Kickstarter delivers on time, the M1 could mark a major shift in personal mobility tech.",

      "In a court filing obtained by Fox News Digital, attorneys for Tyler James Robinson allege that senior members of the prosecutor\u2019s office had \"personal and familial connections to the crime scene,\" failed to step aside and allowed emotion to influence the decision to seek the death penalty.",
      "Robinson is charged with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10, 2025, shooting that killed Kirk during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University in Orem, where an estimated 3,000 people were gathered.",
      "According to the motion, a top supervisory prosecutor in the Utah County Attorney\u2019s Office had a close family member in attendance at the event when the shooting occurred. That family member was approximately 85 feet from Kirk when he was shot and fled the scene in panic, leaving behind a backpack later photographed at the crime scene, defense attorneys say.",

      "The filing alleges the prosecutor received real-time text messages from the family member describing the chaos and reporting that Kirk had been shot in the neck. Those messages, the defense claims, were immediately shared with County Attorney Jeffrey Gray and other members of the prosecution team before any conflict review or ethical screening was put in place.",
      "Despite that personal connection, the prosecutor allegedly remained actively involved in the case, retained supervisory authority over the prosecution team, and discussed the matter internally, raising concerns that prosecutorial discretion may have been influenced by personal fear, trauma or bias.",
      "Defense attorneys argue no recusal occurred and no ethical firewall was established to isolate the conflict, steps courts typically require to protect a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial prosecution. They contend that even the appearance of bias is constitutionally problematic, particularly in a case where the State is seeking the ultimate punishment.",

      "The defense argues the unusually rapid move came just days after prosecutors learned of their colleague\u2019s family member\u2019s traumatic experience at the shooting, raising concerns that emotion, rather than detached legal judgment, played a role in the decision.",

The international community must act responsibly, avoid falling for false narratives and distorted information and refrain from legitimizing a biased and unprofessional report.\"",
      "In its latest report, the IPC\u2019s Famine Review Committee addressed the changing circumstances, explaining that \"following the publication of the [last] FRC report, there was a partial relaxation of the blockade and an increase in the availability of food and other essential supplies.\" While the FRC says this \"came too late to avoid famine in Gaza Governorate in July and early August, the persistence of Famine and its spread to other governorates during the projection period has been avoided.\"",

    "story": [
      "At his year-end press conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke about the threats that transnational terrorist criminal groups pose to the U.S.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: From a distance, Margarita Island looks like a Caribbean escape. Palm-lined beaches, duty-free shops, and resort towns sell the image of a tropical playground just off Venezuela\u2019s northeastern coast. But U.S. officials say the Venezuelan outpost has become something else entirely: Hezbollah\u2019s most important base of operations in the Western Hemisphere, strengthened by Iran\u2019s growing footprint and the Maduro regime\u2019s protection.",
      "That threat, U.S. officials warn, reflects a broader security challenge emerging from the region. \"The single most serious threat to the United States from the Western Hemisphere is from transnational terrorist criminal groups primarily focused on narcotrafficking,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at an end-of-year press conference at the State Department on Friday.",
      "\"Margarita Island might be of significance to the U.S. because of its location and the security dynamics around it,\" Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"It is close to Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada, in an oil-rich part of the Caribbean along key maritime routes, and it has long had a reputation for being a major drug-trafficking hub, possibly because it\u2019s off the mainland, and there\u2019s not a lot of law enforcement there.\"",
      "The island\u2019s isolation, she said, has made it attractive to \"irregular armed groups, foreign intelligence actors and criminal networks that use it as a departure point for boats carrying illicit shipments out of Venezuela.\"",

      "\"From what I have seen and what I have been told, there is a wide range of activities that Hezbollah and to some extent Hamas are engaged in,\" Billingslea told Fox News Digital. \"Margarita Island is really the center of gravity for their activities.\"",

      "In written testimony submitted to the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control for an Oct. 21 hearing, Billingslea traced the island\u2019s transformation back more than two decades. Under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, he wrote, Venezuela \"opened its doors to Hezbollah, allowing the group to establish a major footprint, including a paramilitary training site, on Margarita Island.\"",
      "\"When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro seized power,\" Billingslea added, \"the breadth and depth of Hezbollah\u2019s presence in Venezuela dramatically expanded, as did their ties to the narco-terrorist regime and the Cartel de los Soles.\"",

      "\"The relationship is very close with the Cartel de los Soles, and it has been so for many, many years,\" Billingslea said, referring to the network of senior Venezuelan officials accused by the United States of drug trafficking.",
      "Billingslea said Hezbollah has embedded itself into Margarita Island\u2019s economy, exploiting the island\u2019s duty-free status and cross-border access to Colombia to generate revenue through smuggling and drug importation. He said the group operates a wide range of companies on the island and also maintains several training camps there.",
      "His testimony also detailed how Venezuela\u2019s state apparatus helped embed Hezbollah inside the country. He wrote that former senior official Tareck El Aissami, while overseeing Venezuela\u2019s passport and naturalization agency, \"was instrumental in furnishing passports and citizenship documents to Hezbollah operatives as well as a large number of people from Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.\" Between 2010 and 2019, Venezuelan authorities issued more than 10,400 passports to individuals from those countries, according to the testimony.",

The filing also describes a subsequent weapons delivery at a hangar controlled by Maduro at the country\u2019s main international airport.",
      "Recent developments in the Middle East have only increased Margarita Island\u2019s importance, Billingslea said. Israel\u2019s campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon has damaged the group\u2019s military leadership and financial infrastructure, forcing it to rely more heavily on overseas networks.",
      "\"Israeli successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon in particular, including their strikes on the financial infrastructure Al-Qard al-Hassan that operates in Lebanon, are going to have two effects,\" he said. \"The first is that it is making the fundraising and the revenue generation that comes out of Latin America even more important to the terrorist group. Secondly, we have seen indications that Hezbollah actually has been relocating fighters from Lebanon, several hundred from Lebanon to Venezuela in particular.\"",

      "Asked whether that shift moves the threat closer to the United States, Billingslea said Hezbollah is now operating \"close to the U.S. and further away from the Israelis.\"",
      "He said Iran\u2019s role in Venezuela has deepened alongside Hezbollah\u2019s. \"There is a substantial Iranian footprint in Venezuela related to the trade of weapons and drones, in particular, for gold,\" he said. After suffering losses in the Middle East, he added, \"the Iranians find themselves even more dependent on that supply of gold in exchange for drones and weapons.\"",

      "He said Washington faces a strategic choice. \"I think the United States has positioned sufficient forces in the Caribbean at this time to take care of the Hezbollah threat,\" he said. \"But obviously, when you have a terrorist group that has merged into the local population, highly precise intelligence is needed. I believe the Venezuelan opposition possesses a great deal of that intelligence, though it is not clear to me that the United States government is making the best use of that access.\"",

      "\u201cWhile the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball \u2014 The Times and other outlets have previously done similar work,\u201d she said, according to that source.",
      "President Trump ran on a platform of mass deportations, and his administration began deporting people to El Salvador and CECOT in March, citing the previously rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "Among those sent to CECOT was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported there contrary to a judge\u2019s order, and who was subsequently returned to the U.S. and who was ordered released from immigration custody on Dec. 11. On Monday, a federal judge allowed him to remain free while she considers immigration proceedings in Abrego Garcia\u2019s case.",
      "The 252 Venezuelan men referred to in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report were released from CECOT in July in exchange for the release of 10 Americans held in Venezuela."

She\u2019d flipped and somersaulted around her family\u2019s home growing up, and, as a teen away from home, she trained as an aerialist, practicing gliding down a snowy slope on skis before launching upward and performing tricks.

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved a pill version of Wegovy, Novo Nordisk\u2019s blockbuster weight loss drug.",
      "The Wegovy pill, as it\u2019s called, is first oral version of a GLP-1 drug that has been brought to market for weight loss. A second pill, from Eli Lilly, is also expected to be approved in the coming months.",
      "GLP-1 drugs \u2014 which include semaglutide, the drug in Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy, and tirzepatide, the drug in Lilly\u2019s Mounjaro and Zepbound \u2014 have soared in popularity in recent years. The compounds, initially approved for diabetes, can also offer significant weight loss.",
      "The drugs all come in an injectable form. (Novo Nordisk does make one pill version of semaglutide, called Rybelsus, for diabetes. It comes in a lower dose than the new version for weight loss.)",
      "\u201cThis is a meaningful step forward in the field,\u201d said Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina. \u201cIt won\u2019t replace injectables, but it broadens our tool kit in an important way.\u201d",
      "\u201cPills are familiar, nonintimidating and fit more naturally into most people\u2019s routines,\u201d McGowan added. \u201cFor many patients, a pill isn\u2019t just easier, it\u2019s psychologically more acceptable.\u201d",
      "Novo Nordisk hasn\u2019t released the list price for the pill, which must be taken daily, but it\u2019s expected to be cheaper than the weekly injections. Questions about insurance coverage remain; many private insurers restrict coverage of the injections because of their high cost. Medicare, by law, is barred from covering weight loss drugs, but the pill was also approved for lowering heart disease risk \u2014 which Medicare does cover.",
      "In November, Novo Nordisk reached a deal with the Trump administration to sell the lowest dose of the pill for $149 a month for people who pay out of pocket, in exchange for tariff relief. Lilly made a similar agreement for its weight loss pill.",
      "Like the injections, the pill will come in several doses. People typically start at the lowest dose and gradually increase over several weeks to adjust to any side effects.",
      "How well does the Wegovy pill work?",
      "Phase 3 clinical trial results published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who took the highest dose of the Wegovy pill lost 16.6% of their body weight, on average, after 64 weeks, compared with 2.2% weight loss in the placebo group.",
      "That\u2019s roughly on par with the injectable version of Wegovy, which was shown in clinical trials to reduce weight by about 15% after 68 weeks.",
      "Dr. Shauna Levy, medical director of the Tulane Weight Loss Center, said the biggest challenge for people who opt for the pill version will most likely be adherence: The pill must be taken first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach, with no more than 4 ounces of water.",
      "People in the clinical trial who didn\u2019t stick to the strict schedule lost less weight, 13.6% of their body weight on average.",
      "The open question is \u201creal-world performance,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cWill patients tolerate the daily dosing and strict timing? Will they stay on long enough to see meaningful results? We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "As with GLP-1 injections, the most common reported side effects in the trial were gastrointestinal, including nausea and vomiting.  In some cases, the side effects from the pill version may feel \u201cmore intense,\u201d McGowan said, because the medication hits the stomach all at once and can trigger nausea.",
      "\u201cThe challenges we see with injectable GLP-1s don\u2019t magically disappear with a tablet,\u201d he said.",
      "While the weight loss experienced with the Wegovy pill was on par with that of the injection, Levy said that in general, oral GLP-1 drugs usually don\u2019t lead to as much weight loss as the newer injections.",
      "Lilly\u2019s Zepbound helped people lose 22.5% of their body weight on average after 72 weeks in clinical trials. And Lilly\u2019s next-generation injection, retatrutide \u2014 which hasn\u2019t yet been approved \u2014 led to average weight loss of 24% after 48 weeks.",
      "\u201cZepbound maintains its status as the best medical treatment for obesity, only inferior to weight loss surgery in terms of outcomes,\u201d Levy said.",
      "Novo Nordisk says the differences in weight loss may come down to the fact that a pill is swallowed. The body breaks down part of the pill as it moves through the digestive tract, so less of the medication makes it into the bloodstream compared with an injection. To counter that, the pill comes in a higher dose than injections and must be taken daily, rather than a weekly shot.",
      "The Wegovy pill is closer in effectiveness to Lilly\u2019s orforglipron, which helped people lose about 10.5% of their body weight after 72 weeks in a late-stage trial.",
      "Those aren\u2019t direct comparisons because the drugs weren\u2019t compared in a head-to-head clinical trial.",
      "The company expects the Wegovy pill to be available widely in January, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said.",
      "When Wegovy was first approved, it faced prolonged shortages. To offset shortages this time, the company boosted production of the pill in preparation for its launch, the spokesperson said.",
      "McGowan said oral formulations are often easier to manufacture than injectables, which could help avoid shortages."

      "\u201cHe has a lot of challenges, and we do have great days and some tough days, but in general, he\u2019s very strong. His mobility and cognition have been terrific. So, we\u2019re in a really good place right now,\u201d Isa Bolton, 50, told the AARP in an interview that was published on Dec. 19.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s generally in a really good mood and just like excited for the day,\u201d added Taryn Bolton, 46, in a video accompanying the article.",

      "The cancer is aggressive and difficult to treat because it grows tentacles into the brain rather than forming a solid mass. There is no cure. Uche Ojeh, the husband of TODAY co-host Sheinelle Jones, died of glioblastoma in May 2025. He was 45.",
      "Glioblastoma symptoms include persistent headaches, double vision, changes in mood, memory problems and coordination issues.",

Caregiving can leave a person burnt out, sad and lonely, Taryn Bolton said, advising the millions of others in the same situation to take time to take care of themselves, too.",
      "Is Michael Bolton Still Performing?",
      "The singer is no longer performing, but the family has grown closer since Bolton \u2014 who is known for hits such as \u201cSoul Provider\u201d and spent decades traveling the world on concert tours \u2014 was forced to slow down due to his health issues.",

      "When she was 20 weeks pregnant, Henry was diagnosed with spina bifida, a condition where the spine doesn\u2019t form properly, according to the Mayo Clinic. To manage the stress, Hinson would sing \u201cLong Live\u201d at the top of her lungs, and she says she'd feel Henry dancing inside her.",
      "More than a decade later, that love for Swift would help carry Henry through many of the hardest moments of his young life.",
      "A TikTok video of hospital staff surprising the young superfan with a Swift song customized just for him has gone viral. Henry\u2019s child life specialist and nursing team Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, Indiana serenaded him with a version of  \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d reimagined as \u201cThe Life of Henry.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have been the life of 9 West and have brought so much joy to all of us and all of our patients and our other families, so we have a little surprise for you,\u201d one staff member says in the video.",
      "Some eagle-eyed Swifties may recognize Henry from a first viral moment 2024, when his Halloween costume caught the attention of Swift\u2019s team, leading to an invitation to the \"Eras Tour\" where he and his mom got to meet Swift\u2019s mother, Andrea Swift.",
      "The idea for a custom song came from Maddie Rodriguez, Henry\u2019s certified child life specialist, who formed an instant bond with him when they first met.",
      "\u201cThe first thing he said to me was, \u2018Are you a Swiftie?\u2019 which obviously I am,\u201d Rodriguez tells TODAY.com. \u201cSo it made the relationship just so natural and gave us something to talk about.\u201d",
      "When Henry\u2019s mom told the hospital staff that they\u2019d had to miss their planned at-home \u201cEras Tour\u201d documentary watch party due to his hospitalization, Rodriguez knew she had to do something special for him.",

      "It culminated in a performance of \u201cThe Life of Henry.\u201d Set to the backing track of the album\u2019s titular song, the team launched into their personalized lyrics celebrating everything that makes Henry special.",
      "\u201cWorking with him these last three weeks and getting to know who he is as Henry first, because he is Henry before a patient,\u201d Rodriguez explains. \u201cI just thought of all of his favorite things.\u201d",
      "Henry\u2019s reaction? \u201cI was in shock, like I cried and laughed,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. His favorite part of the song was \u201cwhen they talked about me liking Swig and 67.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they will ever understand the impact that that had on Henry, and on me,\u201d Hinson says. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t just offer medical care that day. It wasn\u2019t just them doing their jobs. They saw Henry.\u201d",
      "The viral performance came during a particularly challenging time for Henry, who has undergone 25 surgeries related to his condition. The week before Thanksgiving, Henry was hospitalized after going into septic shock and required surgery and time on a ventilator as his body fought infection.",
      "\u201cHis bravery, in my opinion, is unmatched,\u201d Hinson says, her voice catching with emotion. \u201cHe faces a lot of really big, scary things.\u201d",
      "For Henry, Swift\u2019s music serves as more than entertainment, it\u2019s a lifeline during scary moments.",
      "\u201cWhen he is scared, when he has to go to the CT machine or he\u2019s going back into surgery, all somebody has to do is say, \u2018Well, tell me about the time you went to the Eras Tour,' and he\u2019s instantly transported into this place that\u2019s safe and secure and that he understands. It just makes his days inside of this hospital a little bit easier,\" she says.",
      "Henry now watches the video of the performance regularly, and his mom catches him humming his own personalized version of the song.",
      "She tells both her sons \u2014 Henry and his 15-year-old brother, Oliver\u2014 that \u201cjoy is a choice we make every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the hard times, it\u2019s especially important that we choose joy, that we look for joy, because it is what sustains us. And so for Henry, he oozes it. He literally oozes joy,\u201d she says.",
      "The viral attention has inspired Henry and his family to give back. When Hinson told Henry that the TikTok video was starting to earn money through the creator fund, \u201che didn\u2019t miss a beat and he said, \u2018Mom, I think we should donate it back to the hospital. You know, they\u2019re the reason we\u2019re getting it,\u2019\u201d she recalls.",
      "Both Henry and his brother Oliver asked their mom to create an Amazon wish list for the child life team at Riley instead of receiving gifts for themselves for the holidays this year.",
      "\u201cThey both were like, \u2018Mom, we have enough stuff,\u2019\u201d Hinson says. The public wish list includes items like Lip Smackers chapstick, which child life specialists use to coat the inside of anesthesia masks so kids smell strawberry or chocolate instead of a sterile operating room.",
      "\u201cChild life specialists often work with a very limited budget, but the work they do is so incredibly important,\u201d Hinson explains. \u201cI\u2019m just incredibly grateful that the internet gets to see the work that really goes into loving children through critical illness.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe Housemaid\u201d stars Sydney Sweeney as Millie, a woman recently released from prison on parole, and Amanda Seyfried, a housewife named Nina Winchester who is looking to hire a live-in housemaid for her and husband Andrew's (Brandon Sklenar) seemingly picture-perfect home in a suburb of New York City.",
      "Directed by Paul Feig, the director of the films \u201cA Simple Favor\u201d and \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d the story is based on the book by the same name and written by Freida McFadden.",
      "When strange things begin to happen at the house, Millie thinks that she understands what is happening. Little does she know that everything is not as it seems.",
      "\u201cShocking,\u201d Seyfried describes the movie to TODAY.com, while Sweeney adds, \u201cSuspenseful and crazy, roller coaster, wild, genre-bending.\u201d",
      "Below, actors Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, as well as director Paul Feig, break down the jaw-dropping ending.",
      "What Happens in \u2018The Housemaid\u2019?",
      "When Millie is first hired as the housemaid for the Winchester family, she thinks she landed the perfect job. Her tasks include cleaning up the home and taking care of the family's seemingly spoiled daughter, Cece (Indiana Elle). She is given a room in the attic to live in, even though the door strangely locks from the outside and has one tiny window that can't be opened.",
      "After her first night sleeping at the house, Millie wakes up to find the kitchen a wreck, with Nina throwing dishes onto the ground and screaming. Nina is only able to calm down when her husband, Andrew, runs into the kitchen and wraps her in a hug.",
      "Although Nina seems to be a perfectly normal housewife when Millie first met her, she quickly devolves and shows that she is deeply troubled. Millie then has to deal with Nina\u2019s ridiculous requests.",
      "Amid Nina's crazy behaviors, Millie builds a relationship with Andrew, who understands the way Nina functions. Their relationship quickly escalates from platonic to sexual when they end up going to New York City to see a play together, and spend the night at a hotel room.",
      "The story comes to a head when Andrew kicks Nina out of the house and says he plans on divorcing her.",
      "What's Really Going on With Nina?",
      "After Nina's actions reach a climax, Andrew decides to kick her out of the house, and is left alone with Millie. They are living happily together when Millie accidentally breaks a plate that belonged to Andrew's grandmother.",
      "Andrew proceeds to lock Millie in her attic room and forces her to cut herself in the stomach with the pieces of the broken plate as a punishment.",
      "The point of view of the film suddenly shifts from Millie's perspective to Nina's perspective. The story goes back in time to recount when single mother Nina first met Andrew and had a quick engagement and wedding. Andrew always wanted a child of their own but as viewers discover, there's a reason Nina didn't want to get pregnant.",
      "It shows how the first few days of their marriage were picturesque, with Andrew seeming like the perfect husband before he suddenly shows his true nature.",
      "Andrew gets upset with Nina for not keeping up the roots of her bleached blond hair and locks her in the attic room. He says that she has to repent for making a mistake and forces her to pull 100 strands of hair out of her head and place them in an envelope in order to be let out of the room.",
      "Nina remains trapped in the room for days without access to food or water. In a feverish state, she finally gives in and completes the punishment.",
      "For years, Nina was forced to deal with the abuse. She feared Cece would be taken away from her if she tried to leave Andrew, as everyone believes he is the perfect husband and she is the crazy wife.",
      "However, Nina comes up with a plan to hire a housemaid, Millie, a pretty young girl with a history of violence to steal Andrew's attention. She knows that Andrew will be attracted to her and would take care of her \u2014 just like he did with Nina.",
      "How Does \u2018The Housemaid\u2019 End?",
      "The timeline flashes back to Millie trapped in the attic room. She has just completed her punishment and hatches a plan to get back at Andrew. She is able to trap him in the attic room and turns the table on him by forcing him to pull out his own tooth.",
      "It is revealed that Millie was in jail for murdering a man who tried to rape her roommate when she was in high school. With this violent background, she is not afraid to stand up to Andrew's  abuse.",
      "Nina feels guilty about leaving Millie with Andrew, knowing that he will torture her, so she goes back to the house to help her. She opens the door to the attic room, thinking that Millie was trapped in there, but actually lets Andrew out of the room.",
      "The group physically fight one other at the top of the stairs, before Millie is able to shove Andrew over the railing, where he falls to his death.",
      "Does Millie go Back to Jail?",
      "After Andrew's death, the police come to the house to question Millie and Nina. The officer who questions them is suspicious because he appeared to have been stabbed in the neck (which Millie did) and fell from the top of the stairs. However, the officer explains that she knew Andrew when he was alive.",
      "The police officer's sister had once been engaged to Andrew, but it is implied that she had broken it off after she discovered his true nature.",
      "It is further implied that she decides to close the case because she knew about Andrew's behavior.",
      "Nina holds a funeral for Andrew, which is attended by his vain mother, as well as the community of parents who believed he was the perfect husband.",
      "Millie is also there and gets a large sum of money from Nina to start a new life. The film, however, ends with Millie interviewing to once again be a housemaid. The woman tells her Nina recommended her and when they are talking, Millie sees that she has bruises on her body. It is implied that Millie's services are needed beyond housekeeping.",

      "\u201cWe kind of get a taste of where Millie goes and what\u2019s going on.\u201d Sweeney tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I want Nina to come back into her life. I feel like Millie really needs Nina.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis can be the last one. There\u2019s only one (unanswered question) in the story. We may find that the release of \u2018Avatar 3\u2019 proves how diminished the cinematic experience is these days, or we may find it proves the case that it\u2019s as strong as it ever was \u2014 but only for certain types of films,\u201d he said.",

      "Here\u2019s what we know about the possible final two installments in the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise.",
      "What Is the 'Avatar' Franchise About?",
      "The sci-fi franchise, created by Cameron, tells the story of a group of humans in the antagonistic Resources Development Administration (RDA) who clash with indigenous humanoid called the Na\u2019vi after greedily colonizing their moon Pandora to mine a valuable mineral.",
      "The franchise\u2019s long arc also features an unlikely love story between a human, Jake Sully, played by Worthington, and the Na\u2019vi warrior Neytiri, played by Salda\u00f1a.",

In \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d viewers get to meet the Mangkwan clan, also known as the Ash People, who are led by their wicked leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin.",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 4\u2019 Be Released?",
      "The year delay in the release of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d pushed back the release dates of the franchise\u2019s final two movies, Deadline reported in June 2023.",
      "\u201cAvatar 4,\u201d which was originally scheduled for a December 2026 release, will now arrive in theaters in December 2029, according to Deadline.",
      "But, as Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published this week, he hopes the just-released \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d is another box-office smash in order for him to continue with the franchise.",
      "Still, Cameron shared tidbits about the script of \u201cAvatar 4\u201d with Entertainment Weekly way back in 2022, revealing that the movie would feature \u201ca big time jump\u201d to accommodate how much the franchise\u2019s younger actors have aged in real life.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young men, young women at that point, when we get to the B side of that time jump,\u201d he said.",
      "During a 2023 appearance on \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace,\u201d Cameron confirmed he\u2019d already begun working on both final films.",
      "\u201c\u2018Avatar 4\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 are both written. We even have some of \u20184\u2019 in the can,\u201d said Cameron.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve begun a franchise at this point,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can safely say we\u2019ve begun a saga that can now play out over multiple films, which was our original goal.\u201d",
      "When Wallace asked if Cameron already knew the final scene of the entire franchise, Cameron responded, \u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s all been written. The scripts for 2, 3, 4 and 5 were all finished over five years ago. It\u2019s all mapped out.\u201d",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 5\u2019 Be Released?",
      "\u201cAvatar 5,\u201d which was originally intended to arrive in theaters in December 2028, is now set for a December 2031 release, reported Deadline.",
      "How Will the 'Avatar' Story End?",
      "As far as how the franchise\u2019s story will wrap up, producer Jon Landau dropped a bombshell about the plot of \u201cAvatar 5,\u201d during a 2022 conversation with Gizmodo\u2019s io9 blog.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to talk about it, but I\u2019ve now subsequently heard that Jim (Cameron) has talked about it a little bit,\u201d Landau said. \u201cIn movie five there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people\u2019s eyes, open Neytiri\u2019s eyes, to what exists on Earth.\u201d",
      "The journey, said Landau, will illustrate to the Na\u2019vi that the colonizing humans in the Resources Development Administration don\u2019t represent all humans.",
      "\u201cEarth is not just represented by the RDA,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like you\u2019re defined by the choices you make in life, not all humans are bad. Not all Na\u2019vi are good. And that\u2019s the case here on Earth. And we want to expose Neytiri to that.\u201d"

      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY\u2019s Craig Melvin, the \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d star described himself as \u201creally fortunate in an unfortunate diagnosis.\u201d",
      "The conversation took place at Van Der Beek\u2019s ranch in Texas and touched on everything from his symptoms to how his wife and six children are dealing with his illness.",
      "The actor, 48, announced he had colorectal cancer last year. In September, he sparked concern when he didn\u2019t attend a \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d reunion in person, appearing in a video instead.",
      "But Van Der Beek said his absence was not cancer related and that he had to miss the event after being \u201chit with some stomach bugs,\u201d which also caused him to lose weight.",
      "\u201cI feel much, much better than I did a couple months ago,\u201d Van Der Beek told TODAY in an interview that aired on Friday, Dec. 19.",
      "\u201cIt's been a longer journey than I ever thought it would be. It's required more of me \u2014 more patience, more discipline, more strength than I knew I had. I knew I was strong. I didn't know I was this strong. But I feel good,\u201d he told Craig.",
      "The actor said he\u2019s still getting cancer treatment, \u201ctrying a bunch of stuff,\u201d though he declined to be specific about the therapies he\u2019s undergone.",
      "Shocked to Be Diagnosed",
      "Van Der Beek never suspected he would face a serious disease.",
      "\u201cI was so healthy, was in amazing cardiovascular shape. I was doing the cold plunges, and the saunas, and the intermittent fasting and all of it,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI had Stage 3 cancer and had no idea.\u201d",
      "His symptoms included a change of bowel habits and feeling like something was off with this body. But they weren\u2019t dramatic \u2014 \u201cnothing that made me think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to run to a doctor right now,\" he said. Still, he made an appointment and asked for a colonoscopy.",
      "Van Der Beek remembered waking up from the anesthesia after the procedure and still in a haze when the doctor told him, \"It is cancer.\"",
      "\u201cI went into shock. I really don't think I knew what to do. Neither did my wife. And we drove home in silence. And part of me wanted to panic. Part of me wanted to just freak out. But then another part of my brain was like, \u2018You don't know enough yet,\u2019\u201d he recalled.",
      "His whole day was consumed with signing up for medical portals, scheduling appointments and scans. He had to pull out of acting roles as cancer became his full-time job.",
      "Van Der Beek was 46 when he underwent a colonoscopy and wants people to know anyone 45 and over can get colorectal cancer screening, whether they have symptoms or not. It can be done with a stool test, a colonoscopy or other techniques.",
      "He suspects doctors would have caught his cancer earlier if he\u2019d asked to be checked right at 45, but he\u2019s turned that regret into energy for raising awareness, which makes him feel better.",
      "\"If anybody takes anything away from this interview, it would be get tested, talk to your doctor,\u201d Van Der Beek said.",
      "Grateful for Family",
      "The actor credits his wife, Kimberly, for keeping him going, calling her \u201can absolute saint.\u201d She\u2019s become a caregiver, nurse, the head of the household and the one managing schedules \u2014 getting the kids to appointments and gymnastics, he said.",
      "The couple has been honest about his diagnosis with their six children, who are between the ages of 4 and 15. The worst case scenario of them crying and being scared never happened, he noted.",
      "\u201cKids know if you're not right. They know if you're sick. They know you're not feeling well. They know if you're in pain,\u201d Van Der Beek said.",
      "\u201cSo their request to me, especially the older ones, is, \u2018Just be honest with us. We want to know.\u2019\u201d",
      "He\u2019s proud to see them build resilience as they handle situations he never wanted to put them in and come out stronger.",
      "New Perspective on Life",
      "Van Der Beek revealed he gets scared sometimes, but tries to breathe through the fear.",
      "\u201cIn private moments, for sure, I break down and get scared and feel weak. And it's just all part of the journey,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe hardest part has been the patience this has required as I'll, say, make a plan and then not be able to follow through on it.\u201d",
      "Still, the actor calls cancer the best thing that ever happened to him because it forced him to make lifestyle changes and appreciate every moment. \u201cPresence I think is really the gift that cancer has given me,\u201d he said.",
      "Van Der Beek started eating a healthier diet and has slowed down. He pondered the concept of self-love and what it meant if he was no longer the same husband, father and provider for his family.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018If I'm just an underweight dude in a room with cancer who can't put his kids to bed because I'm away getting treatment, and can't kiss his wife because I'm not in the same state, what am I?\u2019\u201d he recalled.",
      "\u201cWhat I realized was I'm still worthy of love. My own love, God's love. And so are we all. That I never would've come to realize had I not gone through this journey.\u201d",
      "New Acting Roles",
      "Van Der Beek has just wrapped up filming the prequel series to \u201cLegally Blonde,\u201d which will stream on Amazon Prime Video.",
      "He called the work fun, noting he\u2019s getting more acting offers and is lucky to be in demand.",
      "The actor wants to go back on Broadway, calling stage acting his first love.",
      "Whatever comes his way, he\u2019s focusing on his faith.",
      "\u201cBefore cancer, God was something I tried to fit into my life as much as possible. After cancer, I feel like a connection to God, whatever that is, is kind of the whole point of this exercise on this planet,\u201d Van Der Beek said.",
      "\u201cTo be good stewards of our relationships with other people, and in doing so, connecting to whatever that force of God's love is.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "Jelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "Jelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion",
      "Lee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.",
      "Much of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" about someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview. \"By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I'm not telling my story anymore. I'm getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story's never been told.\"",
      "Jelly Roll: 'I was a part of the problem'",
      "Before the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Outside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Sheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon",
      "Friends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "\"I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that's not just words,\" Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I'm talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor."

    "summary": "A pair of deadly attacks in Syria and Australia has shone a fresh spotlight on the Islamic State, the militant group.",
    "story": [
      "A pair of deadly attacks this month, in Syria and Australia, has shone a fresh spotlight on the Islamic State, the militant group whose sudden rise to power in the Middle East and reign of terror throughout the world had appeared to crest, and then fall, during the 2010s.",
      "But for experts who study ISIS, law enforcement and intelligence officials who fight it and the growing number of victims who have been attacked or intimidated, the group has long been more down than out \u2013 a diminished threat, but a threat nonetheless.",
      "\u201cThey never went away,\u201d said Aaron Zelin, an expert on the group and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe nature of the threat just changed and the nature of the way they organized themselves changed. But what\u2019s animated the Islamic State has never changed.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, a member of Syria\u2019s security forces shot dead three Americans -- two soldiers and an interpreter -- near the city of Palmyra. The Islamic State didn\u2019t claim responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. and Syrian governments both blamed the terrorist group.",
      "The U.S. military launched strikes against Islamic State infrastructure and weapons sites in Syria in retaliation for the attack, officials said Friday.",
      "\u201cWe are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,\u201d President Donald Trump  said Friday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In Sydney, two men opened fire on a Hanukkah gathering at  Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing at least 15 people. Both men were shot by police. One man died; the other, the man\u2019s son, survived and has been charged in the attack. Islamic State social media accounts traditionally linked to the group praised the attack but did not officially claim responsibility, referring to it  in an official publication as \"Sydney's pride.\" The two suspects were found with Islamic State flags and literature.",
      "While the two incidents were notable for their geographic spread, the identities of those killed and a perception that the Islamic State had faded from global headlines, experts say they were exceptions that belie a measurable metric: ISIS is getting weaker, and arrests and attacks have been declining globally.",
      "\u201cThere will always be some space for attacks here and there. But the trajectory is that ISIS is still on the decline,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cAnyone who has a grievance and finds a network can basically attack, and in many cases the central ISIS leaders don\u2019t know it happens until it happens, and then they claim it.\u201d",
      "The group has claimed 1,100 attacks so far in 2025, he said, down from a high of 3,460 in 2019.",
      "There have been 383 ISIS-related arrests worldwide so far in 2025, Zelin said, citing the Washington Institute\u2019s Islamic State Select Worldwide Activity Map, an initiative he leads. Reporting from police sources found 531 such arrests last year, Zelin said, the vast majority of which occurred in active war zones such as Iraq and Syria.",
      "One thing the recent attacks showcase is a strategy that has made the Islamic State effective in the past: its big-tent approach to operations and ideology that allow \u201clone-wolf\u201d actors to affiliate themselves with ISIS with almost no vetting or coordination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing more of and more of the hallmarks of ISIS-related activity that date back 10 years ago,\u201d Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, told NBC News. \u201cThe do-it-yourself model was professionalized and has been really deployed around the world by ISIS, inspiring dozens of people to carry out attacks in their name.\u201d",
      "The Islamic State emerged from the ferment of Syria\u2019s civil war in the early 2010s, when Syria\u2019s porous borders and surfeit of Islamist fighters offered fertile recruiting ground for all manner of jihadi groups. But ISIS  distinguished itself by forming a self-governing state encompassing parts of Syria and Iraq that promised a return to the political expansionism of early Islam.",
      "Though defeated, that \u201ccaliphate\u201d has remained a central part of the Islamic State\u2019s message, even as the group has shifted its focus more toward terrorism than nation-building.",
      "The two suspects in the Bondi Beach shooting are known to have visited the Philippines before the attack. If investigators find that the two men underwent ISIS commando training in southern Mindanao island, that could point to a level of centralized coordination that investigators haven\u2019t seen from ISIS in years.",
      "The group\u2019s activities over the past year have also shown an enduring, if dampened, public appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, Polish authorities said they had arrested a teenager who they said had sought contact with the group and whom they suspected of planning an attack on a Christmas market.",
      "In Michigan in October, two men were charged with plotting a mass shooting over Halloween weekend.",
      "And almost a year ago, an ISIS-inspired American Muslim killed 14 people by driving a truck into New Year\u2019s revelers in New Orleans.",
      "The Islamic State has still been unable to reconstitute its so-called caliphate, a vast Islamist emirate the group ruled across parts of Iraq and Syria until it was finally destroyed in 2019. In both countries, Islamic State attacks reached historic lows in the past year.",
      "Where the group has made strides and managed to constitute some territory is in the Sahel region of northwest sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 countries like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "The Islamic State\u2019s presence in the remote, arid and sparsely populated parts of Africa may still feel more like merely surviving than thriving to the group\u2019s members and potential recruits.",
      "\u201cEven though they\u2019re active in several African countries, it doesn\u2019t have the same kind of ideological reverence because there is so much history in the Arab world related to Islam,\u201d said Zelin.",
      "And while the Sydney terror attack was lethally successful, many of the Islamic State\u2019s attacks have been thwarted by law enforcement as multinational counterterrorism sharing has grown far stronger.",
      "While observers have said it\u2019s too early to say the recent attacks amount to a resurgence of the group, two relatively recent changes could help revive its fortunes. The fall of Bashar al Assad\u2019s regime in Syria a year ago revived the country\u2019s chaos, offering a wider opening for Islamic State.",
      "When Syrian President Ahmed Al Sharaa \u2014 himself a former Islamist militant who once led a like-minded Al Qaeda offshoot group \u2014 joined the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS last month, it painted a target on the Syrian government\u2019s back.",
      "Even before that, an Islamic State-claimed attack on a church in Damascus that killed at least 25 people in June once again jolted Syrian authorities\u2019 attention to Islamic State\u2019s threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the group\u2019s messaging has exploited Israel\u2019s highly lethal war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip as a rallying cry for attacks against the West. Palestinian health officials say over 70,000 people have been killed in the war.",
      "\u201cI think the temperature has been turned up by the conflict in Gaza over the past two years,\u201d said Colin P. Clarke, the executive director of the Soufan Center, a New York-based security think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s brought in a larger swath of people who are now kind of consuming information that leads them pretty quickly through social media algorithms to extreme content.\u201d",
      "As much of the world gathers for the end-of-year religious holidays,  Islamic State commandos \u2014 whether self-annointed or directed by its leadership \u2014 are taking notice as well.",
      "The group has targeted religious festivities in the past, and analysts warned that another spectacular assault against Christian, Jewish or Muslim targets could give the Islamic State the publicity boost it needs for a more deadly and influential 2026.",
      "\u201cThese are big times when they might try to do stuff,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf they can do stuff again quickly, that would be monumental for them, because they haven\u2019t been able to do stuff like that in years.\u201d"

Enrolled at one of the country\u2019s most prestigious engineering schools, Neves Valente graduated at the top of his class, seemingly poised for a bright future.",
      "Now, Neves Valente is dead at age 48, suspected of committing two shocking acts of violence \u2014 and authorities in both the United States and Portugal are looking for a motive that could explain his actions.",
      "Officials believe Neves Valente was behind a mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine other people on Saturday at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is also suspected of fatally shooting 47-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro at Loureiro\u2019s home in the Boston suburb of Brookline on Monday.",
      "The shootings gripped residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts as days passed without anyone in custody. Then on Thursday, authorities announced they had closed in on a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, where they found Neves Valente\u2019s body, who appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Little is known about how he chose his targets, though Neves Valente has past connections to Brown and to Loureiro.",
      "A Providence police affidavit says that Neves Valente came to the U.S. to attend Brown University from August 2000 to spring 2001 on a student visa in the physics Ph.D. program. He requested a leave of absence from the school in 2001, and ultimately withdrew in 2003, the affidavit said.",
      "Neves Valente did not obtain a degree during his time there, Brown\u2019s president said in an email, and he did not have a current affiliation with the university. The email said that during his three semesters at Brown, Neves Valente most likely would have spent time in Barus & Holley, the building where Saturday\u2019s massacre occurred.",
      "Scott Watson told NBC News that he attended Brown with Neves Valente and had been his only friend there. He said Neves Valente was socially awkward and would often complain about Brown.",

      "Watson recalled a conflict that Neves Valente had with another student whom he said Neves Valente would refer to as a \"slave\" because the student was from Brazil.",

Rog\u00e9rio Cola\u00e7o, the president of Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso that Neves Valente graduated with a final average grade of 19 out of 20 \u2014 an exceptionally high score, particularly given how rigorous the university is.",
      "Even before starting college, Neves Valente had made a strong impression academically. He represented Portugal at the 1995 International Physics Olympiad for secondary school students, in Canberra, Australia, a news clip from the science publication Gazeta da F\u00edsica shows.",
      "Yet Neves Valente seemed to have left little imprint on those he studied with.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Authorities in Britain and Australia are tightening restrictions on pro-Palestinians protests in response to the Islamic State-inspired Bondi Beach massacre targeting a Jewish gathering that killed 15 people.",
      "In New South Wales, the Australian state where the deadly attack on a Hanukkah celebration took place, police will be granted expanded powers to shut down unauthorized protests, while tougher hate speech laws will be introduced, including a proposed ban on the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada.\u201d",
      "The move comes shortly after U.K. police arrested two people in London on racially aggravated public order charges for allegedly shouting slogans invoking \u201cintifada\u201d at a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The new restrictions are part of a nationwide policing shift in response to the attack, which has drawn concern from some civil liberties and free-speech advocates.",
      "The Arabic word \"intifada\" is generally translated as \"uprising\" and is used to describe two major Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli occupation, the first beginning in 1987 and the second in 2000, both characterized by periods of violence as well as nonviolent mass protests.",
      "Supporters say the term \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d which has been used for years at pro-Palestinian protests worldwide, refers to international solidarity against Israeli occupation.",
      "Israeli officials and some Jewish organizations, however, argue the term carries an inherent call to violence against Israel and that it functions as antisemitic incitement, a dispute that has increasingly led to policing decisions.",
      "NSW Premier Chris Minns said Thursday that the \u201cimplications\u201d of pro-Palestinian rallies could be seen in the Bondi attack and, after authorities designated the shooting a terrorist event, he has introduced reforms that would give his government powers to shut down unauthorized protests for three months.",
      "\u201cWhen you see people marching and showing violent bloody images, images of death and destruction, it\u2019s unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain,\u201d he said.",
      "Minns on Saturday announced further reforms to hate speech laws that would ban the \"globalize the intifada\" chant alongside other \u201chateful comments and statements,\u201d as well as \u201cterrorist symbols such as the ISIS flags.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday officers would arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d directly citing the context of the attack. A rabbi and a Holocaust survivor were among those killed in the Sydney terror attack, which officials said was intended to directly target the Jewish community.",
      "In a joint statement after the attack, London and Manchester's law enforcement agencies said: \u201cViolent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\u201d",
      "The British police forces also referenced an attack at a synagogue in Manchester earlier this year, where two people were killed on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.",
      "Hundreds of people, many of them elderly, according to British Home Office data, have already been arrested at protests in recent months across the U.K. for showing support for Palestine Action, a group that was banned under British terrorism laws after staging actions targeting military facilities and defense firms. The British government said, without providing evidence, that the group had shown willingness \"to use violence in pursuit of its cause.\"",
      "While major Jewish groups have welcomed last week's changes and proposals in the U.K. and Australia, some analysts and opponents of the new measures warn that governments are responding to security fears by collapsing political speech into criminal conduct.",
      "Index on Censorship, a U.K.-based organization advocating for free expression, said police and prosecutors will need to demonstrate that the words \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d are \u201charmful in and of themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere meaning is genuinely ambiguous, we always argue that the criminal law should tread carefully,\u201d it said in a statement Friday.",
      "Marji Mansfield, 69, a retired financial consultant and grandmother of seven, was carried away in handcuffs by police officers at demonstrations in July and November in London, and faces terrorism charges for expressing support for Palestine Action.",
      "She said she hasn't heard 'globalize the intifada' chanted at rallies, but denied the slogan was an incitement to violence, calling it \"a call for liberation\" amid Israel's ongoing occupation of Gaza.",
      "\"It seems bizarre that our government and the government in Australia are seeking to criminalize words that are saying, 'stop these illegal international crimes against humanity',\" she told NBC News.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, warned in July that some measures in the U.K. limiting pro-Palestinian protests appear \"at odds with the U.K.\u2019s obligations under international human rights law.\"",
      "Freedom of expression \u201chas always been vital, but it\u2019s never been absolute,\" said Mark Stephens, co-chair of the International Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Institute. \"We've always drawn a line at incitement to violence, and so that principle has to adapt in more volatile climates.\"",
      "The difficulty authorities face, Stephens told NBC News, is that they are taking slogans and criminalizing them \"on the grounds that it threatens public safety and the state has a duty to act, but that is an area where reasonable people can and do differ.\"",
      "From a police perspective \"it's becoming a bit of a game of Whac-A-Mole,\" he added. \"If you can't say 'globalize the intifada,' someone will come up with something else which isn't illegal, and that becomes the new phrase du jour.\"",
      "In Australia, the additional legislation on protests has also sparked debate over how far authorities should go in policing political expression.",
      "\u201cFor two years, people have paraded in our streets and universities calling for the intifada to be globalized, a catchphrase which means kill Jews wherever you find them,\" David Ossip, the president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said last week.",
      "Some Jewish groups have opposed the move. The Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \"Palestinian freedom,\" said Thursday in a statement that \"policy which points towards universities, the protest movement and migration as the problem will only lead to more demonization.\"",
      "Australian authorities charged the surviving suspect in the Bondi Beach shooting with 59 offenses on Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder.",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, was charged after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50."

Both were members of the Iowa National Guard. Ayad Mansoor Sakat, of Macomb, Michigan, a U.S. civilian working as an interpreter, was also killed.",

      "\"He knows exactly what I want,\" Trump replied. \"He knows better than anybody.\"",
      "Trump's admission that he's not ruling out a war with Venezuela is significant. He has long tried to distinguish himself from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party, and in 2024, he campaigned on being able to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.",

That brings the country\u2019s total stolen crypto to around $6.75 billion, the report said. The total amount of stolen crypto around the globe rose to $3.4 billion.",
      "A significant chunk of that comes from the hack of the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit this year. The hackers \u2014 who worked for North Korea\u2019s elite government hacking squad, according to the U.S. Secret Service \u2014 stole around $1.5 billion, mostly in ethereum, in February, Bybit\u2019s CEO said.",

      "Part of the theft is most likely due to the increasingly common phenomenon of North Korean hackers\u2019 fraudulently obtaining remote technical jobs with international companies, the report said. That access can put them in positions to give their hacker colleagues a foothold to steal cryptocurrency keys and wire crypto to Pyongyang.",
      "There are scattered incidents of other countries\u2019 professional hackers\u2019 stealing large amounts of money.

      "A U.S. military strike killed four people on a suspected drug vessel in international waters in the eastern Pacific, defense officials said Wednesday.",
      "The attack Wednesday was described as \u201ca lethal kinetic strike\u201d on a vessel operated by a \u201cDesignated Terrorist Organization,\u201d U.S. Southern Command wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cIntelligence confirmed that the vessel was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,\u201d the post said.",
      "Four people were killed, and no U.S. military forces were harmed, military officials said.",
      "Video released by Southern Command showed the boat being hit and erupting in flames and plumes of smoke.",
      "The attack is the latest of more than two dozen U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats that have killed more than 90 people in the eastern Pacific and the Caribbean in recent months. The Trump administration has hailed the strikes as curbing the flow of drugs, including fentanyl \u2014 which is the leading cause of overdose deaths in the U.S. The synthetic opioid is often made with chemicals from China and trafficked through Mexico.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week designating fentanyl and its core precursor chemical as weapons of mass destruction.",
      "The strikes also come at a time of tension between the U.S. and Venezuela. Trump announced a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers on Venezuela on Tuesday and said on Truth Social that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is using oil revenue to finance illicit operations, including \u201cdrug terrorism.\u201d"

      "Ukraine is under intense pressure on the battlefield and at the negotiating table, but underwater it appears to be a growing threat to Russia.",
      "New satellite imagery shows damage to a Russian naval base after Kyiv said it had taken out a submarine with an underwater drone, in what it celebrated as a historic first.",
      "Moscow denied any damage from the strike, which could mark a significant new development in Ukraine\u2019s prolific drone program \u2014 and its campaign to show it can still inflict serious pain on the Kremlin\u2019s war effort.",
      "Colorado-based firm Vantor, which released the satellite images Tuesday, said they revealed damage to the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast.",
      "Russia moved much of its Black Sea fleet to the port to try and shield it from Ukrainian attacks, which had frequently hit its primary base in Sevastopol, on the annexed Crimean Peninsula.",
      "\"A section of a quay in the port has been damaged by the attack and one Kilo-class submarine is positioned nearby. It is unclear if that specific submarine was damaged in the attack; moreover, three additional Kilo submarines are also observed in the port. A series of floating barriers remain positioned at the entrance to the naval base,\" Vantor said."
