      "An upcoming edition of \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d combines the dark and singular talents of two literary giants who apparently never met: Stephen King and the late Maurice Sendak.",
      "HarperCollins Publishers announced Thursday that the King-Sendak re-imagining of the famed Brothers Grimm tale about two lost children in a frightening forest is scheduled for Sept. 2. King's words will be complemented by sketches Sendak drew up for set and costume designs for a 1997 production of the Humperdinck opera adaptation.",
      "The book was initiated by the Maurice Sendak Foundation. King, author of \u201cThe Shining,\u201d \u201cCarrie\u201d and other horror classics, said he decided to agree to the project after seeing Sendak's illustrations.",
      "\u201cTwo of his pictures in particular spoke to me: One was of the wicked witch on her broom with a bag of kidnapped children riding behind her; the other was of the infamous candy house becoming a terrible face. I thought, \u2018This is what the house really looks like, a devil sick with sin, and it only shows that face when the kids turn their backs. I wanted to write that!\u2019\" King said in a statement issued through HarperCollins.",
      "\"To me, it was the essence of this story and, really, all fairy tales: a sunny exterior, a dark and terrible center, brave and resourceful children. In a way, I have been writing about kids like Hansel and Gretel for much of my life.\u201d",
      "Representatives for King say he has no memory of meeting Sendak, although King has expressed admiration for the musical \u201cReally Rosie,\u201d a Sendak-Carole King collaboration.",
      "Lynn Caponera, the Sendak foundation's executive director, said in a statement that she thought King ideal because outside of the Grimms, \u201che's the master of scary stories and a wonderful writer to boot.\u201d",
      "Sendak, who died in 2012, spoke about Hansel and Gretel around the time he was working on the opera. In an interview published in the 2003 book \u201cThe Art of Maurice Sendak\u201d he called the fairy tale \u201cthe most profound\u201d of the Grimm canon.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, most of Grimm is about heroic children. \u2018Hansel and Gretel\u2019 are the most heroic of them all,\u201d said Sendak, known for \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are,\u201d \u201cIn the Night Kitchen\u201d and other children's favorites. \"It\u2019s the toughest story in the world and people are afraid of it, yet it\u2019s famous because it\u2019s so truthful.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani. He's no stranger to the franchise, riding his convertible car as part of the Warriors championship parade, celebrating the team's title in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe're here to break barriers while I'm trying to process it all,\" he added. \"I'm grateful for this opportunity.\u201d",
      "Warriors guard Gary Payton II said he plans on listening to the album.",
      "\u201cFor me, to be the first team to have a music company, or production company, it\u2019s kinda cool,\u201d Payton said. \u201cP-Lo is running it, and getting it done. I know there\u2019s a lot of talented Bay Area artists behind it, so it\u2019s something to look forward to and be excited about.\u201d",
      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "The inner-Vatican machinations of \u201cConclave\u201d have nothing on this year\u2019s Oscar race",
      "NEW YORK -- The inner-Vatican machinations of \u201cConclave\u201d have nothing on this year\u2019s Oscar race.",
      "Just as Edward Berger\u2019s film juggles various candidates for the papacy, the race for best picture at the Academy Awards has seen one favorite replaced by another, and then another.",
      "While some clarity has lately emerged, with a handful of big wins for Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d it seems likely to be a nail biter until a winner is declared at the March 2 Oscars, when white smoke unfurls from the Sistine Chapel, I mean the Dolby Theatre.",
      "As of now, \u201cAnora\u201d is the clear frontrunner thanks to wins with the Producers Guild and the Directors Guild \u2014 both prizes with a long history of predicting Oscar winners. Where the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs fall will offer the last major clues.",
      "But unlike years like last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was way ahead wire to wire, no lead in this year\u2019s best picture race seems ironclad. So, with that in mind, here are the best picture nominees, ranked in order of least likely to win to most likely to win. It\u2019s telling that at least half of these films, with three weeks to go, still have a chance.",
      "If this was a ranking of merit, RaMell Ross\u2019s movie would be first. Ross\u2019 film, thrillingly and thoughtfully shot largely in first person, introduced a new filmic grammar to American movies. But \u201cNickel Boys\u201d was seemingly on the cusp of getting a nomination, so we should just be glad it\u2019s counted here among the best of the year.",
      "Denis Villeneuve\u2019s first Frank Herbert adaptation garnered 10 nominations and won six. \u201cPart Two\u201d hasn\u2019t been the same awards force. It\u2019s up for five nominations and will probably walk home with one or two Oscars, possibly for visual effects and sound. People like \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d but sequels tend to have a harder go of it at the Academy Awards. Blame it on the sandworms.",
      "Arguably no film has risen up the Oscar ranks more than Walter Salles\u2019 portrait of political resistance under Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. The film, a box-office sensation in its native country, was once one of the many international underdogs vying for a place at the Academy Awards. It won\u2019t win best picture, but it\u2019s a testament to the film\u2019s appeal that it could upset \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d in best international film.",
      "Coralie Fargeat\u2019s body-horror film has turned out to be much more of an Oscar contender than initially believed \u2014 certainly by Universal, which financed the film but sold it to Mubi to distribute. It\u2019s up for five awards but its best chance comes in the best actress category where Demi Moore is the favorite. Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) and Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could make that a close call, too, but Moore \u2014 propelled by her \u201cpopcorn actress\u201d narrative and the movie's biting showbiz satire \u2014 is the frontrunner.",
      "How far can a former frontrunner fall? Jacques Audiard\u2019s narco-musical leads all films with 13 nominations but the Netflix movie has been in freefall since its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, became ensnarled by a scandal over old tweets. I\u2019m not completely counting \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d out \u2013 you don\u2019t get 13 nominations for nothing. But \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a divisive movie to begin with, is now in the business of salvaging its chances in other categories, like best supporting actress, where Zoe Salda\u00f1a could win.",
      "Now we\u2019re into the top contenders. Most likely, the winner is coming from one of these next five. Jon M. Chu\u2019s Broadway adaptation might have the most moviegoers rooting for it to win, but it\u2019s missing some key ingredients for pulling out best picture. Chu missed on a nomination for best director and the \u201cWicked\u201d has mostly been out-musical-ed by \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d on the awards circuit. Still, \u201cWicked\u201d has cornered the market on the role of Big Studio Movie contender. However it does, the film academy is going to make sure \u201cWicked\u201d is front and center during the ceremony.",
      "Here we have our Everyone Likes It contender. Berger\u2019s papal thriller, starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading a conclave, feels like the most universally respected nominee. In a year where votes are spread across a lot of films, that might be a quality that \u2014 particularly considering the academy\u2019s preferential ballot \u2014 leaves \u201cConclave\u201d driving the Oscar home in a popemobile. What\u2019s the main knock against this happening, aside from the potential difficulty of renting a popemobile? Berger was passed over on a directing nomination, and \u201cConclave\u201d hasn\u2019t yet won a major award. More than any other movie, it needs a victory at the BAFTAs.",
      "James Mangold\u2019s Bob Dylan movie is also widely liked and lacks any precursor win. But admiration for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d is widespread and it could, just as \u201cConclave\u201d might, pull out an upset by rising high on a plethora of ballots. Unlike \u201cConclave,\u201d Mangold was nominated for best director, though, and it has the benefit of being led by Hollywood\u2019s biggest young star, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Hollywood likes to, in picking a best picture winner, say something about its future. Chalamet's star power could be convincing enough. Plus Searchlight Pictures has previously steered quite a few best-picture winners (\"Nomadland,\" \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d). Mangold\u2019s movie has momentum, which, even if it doesn\u2019t lead to best picture, may propel Chalamet to best actor over Adrien Brody for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Until recently, Brady Corbet\u2019s postwar epic might have been the top pick. \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d has been an award-winner at Venice and the Golden Globes. It\u2019s up for 10 Oscars. It\u2019s roundly been hailed as visionary, hugely ambitious cinema \u2014 all made, remarkably, with a budget under $10 million. It\u2019s also three and a half hours long. Not every Oscar voter, I assure you, is watching it all the way through. That, though, might not be a bad thing for a movie that falls off in the second half.",
      "Half a year ago, \u201cAnora\u201d was the odds-on pick to win best picture and now, after a topsy-turvy awards season, it is again. A trio of wins \u2014 at the PGA Awards, the DGA Awards and Critics Choice \u2014 has reestablished \u201cAnora\u201d as the movie to beat.",
      "If it wins at the SAG Awards, too, the race is probably over. Not everything with similar credentials has won before, though; \u201c1917\u201d had the same wins before being defeated by \u201cParasite\u201d five years ago. \u201cAnora,\u201d however, also won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, like \u201cParasite\u201d did, so it should do well among international voters \u2014 a crucial voting bloc in today's academy.",
      "It\u2019s also just really good. \u201cAnora\u201d comes from a widely respected filmmaker in Baker, a prominent defender of the theatrical release. And his movie, a sly and devastating twist on a \u201cPretty Woman\u201d-like fable, is as connected to Hollywood's celebrated '70s as it is to its indie filmmaking present.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs is suing NBC Universal over a documentary that he says falsely accuses him of being a serial murderer who had sex with underage girls as he awaits trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court says the documentary, \u201c Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy,\u201d included statements that NBC Universal either knew were false or published with reckless disregard for the truth in order to defame the founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the entire premise of the Documentary assumes that Mr. Combs has committed numerous heinous crimes, including serial murder, rape of minors, and sex trafficking of minors, and attempts to crudely psychologize him,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt maliciously and baselessly jumps to the conclusion that Mr. Combs is a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018an embodiment of Lucifer\u2019 with \u2018a lot of similarities\u2019 to Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Paul McCartney\u2019s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.",
      "It was probably less than that since McCartney\u2019s sound board and gear \u2014 too much to fit backstage \u2014 occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.",
      "Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.",
      "\u201cSo, here we are,\u201d McCartney said, grinning. \u201cSome little gig. New York. Why not?\u201d",
      "Later, he added before launching into \u201cLet Me Roll It\u201d: \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.\u201d",
      "It was not McCartney\u2019s first impromptu concert. The Beatles, of course, famously performed atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London in 1969. Since then he\u2019s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.",
      "In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles\u2019 famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his \u201cEgyptian Station.\u201d",
      "With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.",
      "For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.",
      "Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. \u201cI thought: I can do this,\u201d Jaffe said before the show. \u201cI put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.\u201d",
      "Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it.\u201d",
      "Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.",
      "\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Sokoloff said. \u201cI\u2019m always learning about these things the day after.\u201d",
      "McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to rehearse!\u201d",
      "If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn\u2019t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and also performed \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d \u201cLady Madonna,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlackbird\u201d was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandchildren older than that now.\u201d",
      "In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d \u201cFrom Me to You.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had everything to do with the fans, really,\u201d McCartney said.",
      "Before playing the Wings song \u201cMrs. Vanderbilt,\u201d McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it gets back to that soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. \u201cThat was a Beatles scream.\u201d Then he asked for more, saying, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.\u201d All in attendance obliged.",
      "McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, \u201c Now and Then,\u201d a ballad penned by Lennon in the late \u201970s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary, \u201c The Beatles: Get Back.\u201d The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for John,\u201d he said.",
      "McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary festivities. He\u2019s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday.",
      "It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he\u2019s hoping to finish a new album this year.",
      "For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. \u201cSome of us need to get some sleep, you know,\u201d he replied.",
      "McCartney still came back, bouncing on the stage for an encore. He closed with the rousing \u201cAbbey Road\u201d send off of \u201cCarry That Weight\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d concluded with its immortalized final lines: \u201cAnd in the end/ The love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\u201d",

      "The reporter, whom the AP would not identify, tried to enter the White House event as usual Tuesday afternoon and was turned away. Later, a second AP reporter was barred from a late-evening event in the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room.",
      "The highly unusual ban, which Trump administration officials had threatened earlier Tuesday unless the AP changed the style on the Gulf, could have constitutional free-speech implications.",
      "Julie Pace, AP's senior vice president and executive editor, called the administration's move unacceptable.",
      "\u201cIt is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,\u201d Pace said in a statement. \u201cLimiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP\u2019s speech not only severely impedes the public\u2019s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration made no immediate announcements about the moves, and there was no indication any other journalists were affected. Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media. On Friday, the administration ejected a second group of news organizations from Pentagon office space.",
      "Before his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump announced plans to change the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name to the \u201cGulf of America\u201d \u2014 and signed an executive order to do so as soon as he was in office.

      "The AP said last month, three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that it would continue to refer to the Gulf of Mexico while noting Trump\u2019s decision to rename it as well.

      "Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write.

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:58:25 -0500",

      "For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday",
      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky may take the risk of taking the stand in his own defense on Tuesday at his trial over two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "In discussion with a Los Angeles judge on the last phases of Rocky's trial, his lawyer Joe Tacopina said that either his client would testify early Tuesday or the defense would rest its case. An attorney for the prosecution said his team was going to spend the night preparing for Rocky's testimony.",
      "He is not legally required to testify, and subjecting a defendant to a difficult cross-examination is often a major gamble in criminal cases.",
      "Tacopina said before the trial that Rocky was \u201ceager to tell his story. He would love the opportunity to do so.\u201d",
      "The attorneys could not give comment outside court Monday because a judge has forbidden them from speaking to the media. Rocky faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted, after turning down a pre-trial plea deal that could have led to just 180 days in jail.",
      "If Rocky testifies, he\u2019ll probably have to face a long and combative cross-examination from Deputy District Attorney John Lewin. In his most famous case, Lewin kept real estate heir Robert Durst on the stand for nine days of relentless questioning before he was convicted of murder.",
      "Rocky is a Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, fashion mogul and the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear Tuesday to watch his testimony.",
      "She has shown up sporadically \u2014 most recently on Friday, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, would likely testify that a gun he fired twice \u2014 in a scuffle with a former friend on a Hollywood street corner in 2021 \u2014 was a starter pistol that only fired blanks, and that he carried it for security.",
      "On Monday, his tour manager became the second witness from Rocky's inner circle to testify that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Lou Levin said he told the rapper it made sense to carry it after Rocky's house had been broken into by a stalker and others.",
      "\u201cSecurity and I thought it would be a good idea, because of the prior violence,\" Levin said. \"It\u2019s just a nonlethal form of self-defense.\u201d",
      "Levin said he got the gun from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, about three months before the incident that led to the charges, and on the day itself.",
      "He told the jury that he returned the phony gun to the music video's co-director, who no longer had it when Levin asked about it after Rocky's arrest. The defense said it does not have the starter pistol now.",
      "Authorities also did not recover the pistol they allege Rocky used.",
      "Levin testified that an ammunition magazine found in Rocky's house by officers serving a search warrant actually belonged to him.",
      "Lewin, the prosecutor, said \u201cyou had to come up with a story\u201d to explain the magazine. He later called every aspect of the story \u201ca lie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have to come up with a story \u2014 it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Levin said."

      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste transformed the Super Bowl stage into a symphony of creativity, debuting new music, reimagining \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\" and shining a global spotlight on his wife's creative vision.",
      "As Batiste performed the national anthem Sunday, the multi-talented musician played a piano adorned with a colorful butterfly painting by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who came up with the idea while making their documentary \u201cAmerican Symphony.\u201d Her artwork, the city\u2019s resilience after the New Year\u2019s attack, and the memory of his late veteran grandfather all fueled his performance.",
      "\u201cThis was powerful. The spirit came over me,\u201d Batiste told The Associated Press after his performance at the Caesars Superdome. On Monday he unveiled \u201cMy United State,\u201d a two-track project featuring \u201cStar-Spangled Blues\u201d and \u201cNotes from My Future Self.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the anthem that had samples included in it,\u201d said Batiste, a Louisiana native who is a Grammy and Oscar winner and former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t clear the main sample that I wanted until the night before.\u201d",
      "Batiste, 38, said his reinvented national anthem draws from \u201cDrag Rap\u201d by The Showboys \u2014 better known as the Triggerman beat \u2014 a staple of New Orleans bounce and hip-hop culture. He aimed to showcase the city's rich culture and heritage while putting his own stamp on a song that was first echoed at the Super Bowl in 1967, performed by The Pride of Arizona, the Michigan Marching Band and the UCLA Choir.",
      "Over the years, the anthem has been reimagined by music legends like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all come in different tempos and melodies. It\u2019s a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t never work together unless it was framed by the American ideal. I wanted to capture it in an arrangement. Just in the sound.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Batiste reflected on his wife\u2019s resilience, new songs, an upcoming tour and his festival this weekend that will leave a lasting musical impact on New Orleans.",
      "During the filming of \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d inspiration struck \u2014 not just in the documentary, but on canvas. As Jaouad painted, one creation that took flight was a vivid butterfly, embodying what he calls the \u201cpower of resilience, delicate beauty, and grace.\u201d",
      "Jaouad's painting was on the piano and bench Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's the balance of this duality,\u201d he said about watching his wife creatively express herself during \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d which won a Grammy for best music film. \u201cIt Never Went Away\u201d from the documentary also won best song written for visual media. He's thankful for the collaboration and proud of Jaouad, a writer who is battling cancer for a third time.",
      "In December, she revealed her diagnosis on social media.",
      "\u201cShe's a one of a kind human being, like a person who has so much light from within,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou look into her eyes and you see the work. I'm very glad that she was able to not only survive, but have this alchemizing process of it all to lift it into something that's even more than just a way of making lemonade out of lemons.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis is more than just taking a bad thing and making it good. It's almost a blessing, as wild as it is to think about it like that.\u201d",
      "While crafting \u201cNotes from My Future Self,\u201d Batiste had three things on his mind: returning home, the national anthem and the wide-eyed wonder of him at 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt really brought together so many things in my subconscious,\u201d said the seven-time Grammy winner. \"It brought them together, like all these stories, notes. What would the young me think about what\u2019s happening now and how to really connect to this moment from their inner child plays in this song? It just came out of that.\u201d",
      "Batiste called the upbeat song an anthem that represents self-empowerment for himself and others too. He said making the song was a profound journey of artistic realization.",
      "\u201cWhen you hear the song and you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s me talking to my younger me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also be you, talking to young you. In a moment like this, it\u2019s important for us to heal, to really thrive and be rooted in who we are. We have to go back to that kid.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the musical foundation came while talking to director Alan Ferguson, his frequent collaborator. He said they had a vision of using spoken word, poetry and hip-hop within the context of \u201cradical cause, positivity and openness.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life,\u201d he said. \u201dIt's a natural intuition and the visual possibility and the evolution of me as an artist is just me going into this new zone. ... When it aligns like that, that's how I know it's the right direction.\"",
      "After Batiste's Super Bowl performance, his next goal is creating visuals for \u201cNotes from My Future Self\" and hitting the road for a concert tour.",
      "Full details have to yet been released, but he's looking to perform new music and songs from Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),\u201d which reimagined the iconic German pianist\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou really get a twofer on this next run,\u201d Batiste said.",

      "His He Gets Us Presents Jon Batiste\u2019s Love Riot Festival transformed the grounds of George Washington Carver High School into a celebration of music, hope, and action. The event also highlighted plans for a future sports field to serve local schools.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make something where we go to the places that are forgotten but are the foundation,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cThey are the foundation of why we want to come to New Orleans in the first place and go to those communities.\u201d",
      "Batiste, alongside Sing for Hope, led 10 New Orleans artists in creating hand-painted pianos, scattered throughout the 9th Ward as an open invitation to the festival. After the event, these vibrant instruments will find permanent homes in schools and community centers, keeping the music alive long after the final note.",

      "\u201cSalutations",
      "\u201cSalutations!,\u201d the actor Samuel L. Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam introduced Kendrick Lamar at New Orleans\u2019 Caesars Superdome for the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 a powerful, commanding creative choice by the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot.",
      "As if there were any doubts of the Pulitzer Prize winning rapper's ability to put on a show.",
      "As dozens of dancers emerged from a Buick GNX clown car style, he launched into an as-yet-untitled new song that had been teased with an online snippet when his \"GNX\" album was released, then moved into \u201cSquabble Up.\" For just under 13 minutes during the halftime show sponsored by Apple Music and Roc Nation, Lamar commanded the field.",
      "Dancers dressed in red, white and blue joined Lamar. But even in their patriotic colors, they were labeled \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d by Jackson's Uncle Sam, who reminded Lamar to \u201cplay the game.\u201d Then, he launched into \u201cHumble.,\u201d \u201cDNA.,\" \u201cEuphoria\" and \u201cman at the garden.\u201d",
      "\u201cScore keeper, deduct one life,\u201d Jackson interrupted again. Lamar launched into \u201cpeakboo,\u201d and then teased a performance of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanna play their favorite song but you know they love to sue,\u201d Lamar told the women dancers behind him, referencing Drake.",
      "It is hard to underscore the ubiquity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d \u2014 with its billion streams on Spotify, the massive hit is a regional anthem for Los Angeles, a rallying cry for community and against culture vultures, a diss track that won Lamar the highly-publicized feud with Drake and the track that won song and record of the year at the Grammys last weekend.",
      "Leading up to the Super Bowl, whether or not Lamar would perform the song was a legitimate question held by fans and critics alike. Lamar levels strong accusations against Drake in its lyrics; Drake has sued Universal Music Group for defamation as a result of the song's popularity. Does a Super Bowl performance further complicate things?",
      "Little was known about Lamar's halftime performance ahead of time. Lamar promised to keep his passion for storytelling at the forefront of his plans, and SZA was a previously announced guest performer. They are frequent collaborators; she most recently appeared his recent album \u201cGNX\u201d and was featured on a couple songs including \u201cGloria\u201d and \u201cLuther,\u201d which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn through \u201cIf This World Were Mine.\u201d The duo will also co-headline a 19-city North American tour this spring and summer.",
      "SZA appeared on stage for \u201cLuther\" and \u201cAll the Stars.\"",
      "\u201cThat's what America wants \u2014 nice and calm,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "And then, like clockwork: Lamar launched into \"Not Like Us\" \u2014 with the removal of the word \u201cpedophiles\u201d in its lyrics \u2014 into \u201ctv off.\u201d",
      "He brought out the producer Mustard and tennis superstar Serena Williams was spotted crip walking along to the diss track.",
      "Is there any better publicity than the biggest stage in U.S. sports? Consider this just another step in Lamar's continued victory lap.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having previously performed at the NFL\u2019s championship game in 2022 as a guest artist, alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem.",
      "\u201cRap music is still the most impactful genre to date,\u201d Lamar said in a statement in September, when he was first announced as the 2025 halftime performer. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.\u201d",
      "Make no mistake about it \u2014 that's exactly what he did Sunday evening.",

      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

      "Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen. Last year, Apple\u2019s much-derided \u201cArgylle\u201d debuted on the same weekend. Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters in trailers for the huge football audience on TV.",
      "It wasn\u2019t a banner weekend for \u201cDog Man.\u201d It fell steeply, dropping 62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million, \u201cDog Man\u201d has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two weeks.",
      "Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group\u2019s \u201cHeart Eyes,\u201d released by Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102 locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less impressed. Moviegoers gave it a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore. Spyglass made \u201cHeart Eyes\u201d for $18 million.",
      "\u201cLove Hurts,\u201d the action comedy from 87North Productions (\u201cJohn Wick,\u201d \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters.

It, too, was modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected the movie, giving \u201cLove Hurts\u201d a \u201cC+\u201d CinemaScore.",

      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",

      "Dog folk often call the Westminster Kennel Club show the Super Bowl of canine competitions",

      "Sorry \u2014 no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports.",
      "Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years.",
      "\u201cI always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl \u2018the Westminster of football,\u2019 \u201d quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all.",
      "And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster\u2019s green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)",
      "Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.",
      "\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d be here. And now we\u2019re here,\u201d Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday.",

      "\u201cShe\u2019s very intuitive, very natural -- probably smarter than me,\u201d handler Emily Klarman told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.",
      "A sizeable, black-and-white dog named Gable won a special award for the best mixed-breed competitor.",
      "Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillion mix named Nimble, who competed again this year.",
      "She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.",
      "His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored.",
      "\u201cHe's always exciting \u2014 he does ridiculous things,\u201d she said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs Saturday. \u201cWe have fun, regardless what happens.\u201d",
      "While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly-Labradoodle mix, used to be \u201cafraid of the world\u201d but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.",
      "Saturday's canine competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a seven-pound (0.9-kg) papillion, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog.",
      "They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes.",
      "Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again.",

      "The Canadian government announced Brosseau\u2019s appointment as its fentanyl czar Tuesday.",
      "The move was partly in response to President Donald Trump saying the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S. was a reason for threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with an exception of 10% on energy.",
      "Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear demonstration of how serious Canada is taking the fentanyl crisis in his country and how important our relationship is with our American counterparts,\u201d said Brosseau, who was speaking after touring a Canada Border Services Agency port of entry facility in Lansdowne, Ontario.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping to be able to give an intensity to the work,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mandate is clear, to be able to bring people together to integrate the work and produce results.\u201d",
      "Figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show the agency seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the northern border last year. That compares to 9,570 kilograms (21,098 pounds) at the southwestern border.",
      "Brosseau spent more than 20 years in the RCMP, where he served as a deputy commissioner and the senior Mountie in the province of Manitoba. More recently, he was deputy national security and intelligence adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Brosseau said he plans on meeting with Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s border czar, and other U.S. officials soon.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spent a number of years working in law enforcement,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how important those relationships, those collaborations are on the ground. We\u2019re stronger together.\u201d",

      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.",

      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",

      "The U.S.-led global response to HIV has been so effective that AIDS wards of people wasting away are a vision of the past. Now health experts, patients and others fear those days could return if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t reverse course or no other global power steps into the void, and fast.",
      "\u201cIn the next five years, we could have 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths,\u201d the U.N. AIDS agency told The Associated Press. That's a shock at a time of rising complacency around HIV, declining condom use among some young people and the rise of a medication that some believe could end AIDS for good.",
      "The agency has begun publicly tracking new HIV infections since the aid freeze.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what happens to the body when HIV drugs are stopped:",
      "HIV is spread by bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk or semen. It gradually weakens the body\u2019s immune system and makes it vulnerable to disease, including ones rarely seen in otherwise healthy people. The surprising emergence of such cases in the 1980s is what tipped off health experts to what became known as the AIDS epidemic.",
      "Years of intense advocacy and shocking sights of children, young adults and others dying of pneumonia and other infections led to the response that created PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Twenty million people around the world died before the program was founded. Now millions of people take drugs known as antivirals that keep HIV from spreading in the body.",
      "Stopping those drugs lets the virus start multiplying in the body again, and it could become drug-resistant. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. Babies born to mothers with HIV can escape infection only if the woman was properly treated during pregnancy or the infant is treated immediately after birth.",
      "If the drugs are not taken, a body is heading toward AIDS, the final stage of infection.",
      "\u201cWithout HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "For a long time, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But a person can easily spread HIV to others, and the immune system becomes vulnerable to what are called opportunistic diseases.",
      "The National Institutes of Health says opportunistic diseases include fungal infections, pneumonia, salmonella and tuberculosis. For a country like South Africa, with the world\u2019s highest number of HIV cases and one of the largest numbers of TB cases, the toll could be immense.",
      "Unchecked by HIV treatment, the damage continues. The immune system is increasingly unable to fight off diseases. Every action, from eating to travel, must consider the potential exposure to germs.",
      "For years, the importance of taking the drugs every day, even at the same time of day, has been emphasized to people with HIV. Now the ability to follow that essential rule has been shaken.",
      "Already, hundreds or thousands of U.S.-funded health partners in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia have been laid off, causing widespread gaps in HIV testing, messaging, care and support on the continent most helped by PEPFAR. At some African clinics, people with HIV have been turned away.",
      "Restoring the effects caused by the Trump administration's foreign aid freeze during a 90-day review period, and understanding what\u2019s allowed under the waiver for PEPFAR, will take time that health experts say many people don't have.",
      "Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. AIDS agency, Winnie Byanyima, told the AP that more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.",
      "And an additional 3.4 million children could be made orphans \u2014 another echo of the time when the world raced to confront AIDS with few tools at hand.",

      "Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them",
      "PHOENIX -- Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them, saying the state is not capable of fixing deep failures in care even though it has been required to do so over the last decade.",
      "In a filing Tuesday, the attorneys said a takeover is urgently needed because the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry lacks the leadership to comply with changes ordered by a judge in a 2012 lawsuit over the quality of medical and mental health care for prisoners.",
      "The first constitutional violation in the case was found in 2015, they said, and \u201cA decade later, defendants still have not demonstrated the will, knowledge, or capacity to reform their prison healthcare system.\u201d",
      "Arizona settled the case in 2014 but for years was dogged by complaints that it failed to follow through on its promises. The court slapped the state with contempt fines of $1.4 million in 2018 and $1.1 million in 2021. The settlement was eventually thrown out due to Arizona\u2019s noncompliance, and a trial was ordered.",
      "In a blistering 2022 verdict, U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver ruled that the state was violating prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights by providing them with inadequate care, knew about the problem for years and refused to correct it.",
      "She also said prison health care deficiencies resulted in preventable deaths and issued an injunction requiring corrections authorities to fix the constitutional violations.",
      "In September 2019 lawyers representing the prisoners made a similar request for a takeover, also known as a receivership. Though Silver has previously shied away from granting that, she later said she would revive that possibility if the state acts in bad faith or fails to comply with the court-ordered changes.",
      "Lawyers for prisoners pointed to a recent report from a court-appointed expert who said health care for prisoners \u201cremains poor, has shown little improvement since the start of the Injunction, and continues to place the residents at significant risk of serious harm, including death.\u201d",
      "The corrections department and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs' office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the request.",
      "Past receiverships have been ordered for prisons in other states. In California in 2005, a federal judge seized control of the prison medical system after finding that an average of one inmate a week was dying of medical neglect or malpractice.",
      "The Arizona lawsuit does not cover the nearly 10,000 people incarcerated in private prisons for state convictions."

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) \u2014 Ebola cases in Uganda have risen to nine, while 265 other people were being monitored under quarantine, health authorities said Tuesday.",
      "The nine include the first victim, a male nurse who died the day before the outbreak was declared on Jan. 30. That man remains the only fatality.",
      "Eight patients \"are receiving medical care and are in stable condition,\u201d a Health Ministry statement said. Seven of them were admitted to the main public hospital in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, in addition to one being treated in the eastern district of Mbale, the ministry said, adding that \u201cthe situation is under control\u201d amid heightened surveillance.",
      "The nurse who died had first sought treatment in Kampala and later traveled to Mbale, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said that the man also sought the services of a traditional healer. His relatives are among those being treated for Ebola.",
      "Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million, and officials are still investigating the source of the outbreak.",
      "Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever.",
      "There are no approved vaccines for the Sudan strain of Ebola that is infecting people in Uganda. But authorities have launched a clinical study to further test the safety and efficacy of a trial vaccine as part of measures to stop the spread of the current outbreak.",
      "The last outbreak of Ebola in Uganda, which began in September 2022, killed at least 55 people by the time it was declared over four months later.",
      "Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Scientists suspect that the first person infected in an Ebola outbreak acquires the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.",

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.",
      "And one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.",
      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",
      "Bills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.",
      "That's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.",
      "Still, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.",
      "Reached by phone, South Carolina Rep. Luke Rankin, a Republican who added his name to a list of bill sponsors last week, said, \u201cI've always been pro-life.\u201d When asked about the provision to allow prosecution of women seeking abortion, he said: \u201cI can't help you there\u201d and declined to answer questions.",

      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "",
      "\"Well, dual eligibles are not right now served very well into the system,\" Kennedy replied. \"And you know I suppose my answer to that is to make sure that the programs are consolidated, they're integrated, and the care is integrated. I look forward to working with you, Dr. Cassidy, on making sure that we take good care of people.\"",

      "In fact, MA plan beneficiaries generally pay no or very low premiums and choose their plans because of low or non-existent upfront costs. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare  --  $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.",
      "",
      "At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is \"fully paid for by the federal government,\" when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. That's an important concept to understand, since each Medicaid program's coverage and eligibility requirements can vary enormously through complex federal waiver programs run by HHS agencies.",
      "",
      "The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees.",

      "\"He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with,\" Benjamin said.

[HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. There's a lot of reasons for that, but he ain't the guy to fix that because he really doesn't know. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does.\"",

      "Kressly said that Kennedy is wrong, as children can experience complications of COVID months after they recover, she said.

      "Trump is not alone in his antipathy to teleworking for federal workers. Last December, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) released a report stating that only 6% of federal workers were in the office full-time; the report was titled \"Out of Office: Bureaucrats on the beach and in bubble baths but not in office buildings.\" Ernst's percentage was very much at odds with a 2024 OMB report  --  which has since been removed from the OMB website  --  that found that 54% of federal employees work in the office full-time, while the other 46% of the federal workforce is telework eligible, according to a story on the Meritalk website. Only 10% of federal employees \u2013 228,000 people \u2013 are in fully remote jobs.",
      "",
      "Generally Popular With Both Parties",
      "",
      "Overall, however, telework actually has been popular on both sides of the aisle, Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said last month on a phone call with reporters: \"There has been bipartisan support for telework in the federal space for many, many years, because it's been shown to  --  when well-applied  --  provide both for better performance and improved ability to recruit the best talent for federal positions.\" The Partnership for Public Service says its aim is to build \"a better government and a stronger democracy.\"",
      "",
      "In the past few years, \"there's obviously been a push to try to move people in the federal space back into the office,\" Stier continued. \"The Biden administration actually pushed aggressively to try to make that happen. ... Some organizations like the Patent and Trademark Office have been high performing virtually exclusively. ... We know it's really important to understand that you have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even pre-pandemic, and you wouldn't want to disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences for the American people.\"",
      "",
      "The in-office order comes as the General Services Administration announced plans to significantly reduce the federal government's real estate footprint. \"One of the things that our government has become is more efficient with respect to cost, in terms of its physical footprint, as a result of increased use of telework and remote work,\" said Stier. \"So those things do run in conflict with each other, and certainly it's so important to understand the transition needs of any organization.\"",
      "",
      "Like everyone else in the federal workforce, HHS's more than 80,000 employees  --  several of whom spoke to MedPage Today on condition of anonymity  --  are trying to figure out how the back-to-work order will be implemented in their specific situation. The agency consists of workers assigned to the HHS headquarters office in Washington as well as 10 regional offices spread throughout the U.S., and lingering logistical questions remain. Some who have previously worked at the Washington headquarters, for example, say there is likely not enough interior space or parking to accommodate all of the employees if everyone now assigned there were to return full-time.",

      "One employee working in a different location said they had heard that supervisors were going to have to return to work full-time sooner than non-supervisory employees, and that there might still be some \"ad hoc\" telework agreements. There may not be enough space for everyone to be in their building, the employee said.",
      "",
      "Still another employee said that their colleagues were \"none too pleased\" to hear about the back-to-office-full-time requirement, noting that the rule appeared to supersede other arrangements in which people could, for instance, work four 10-hour days and get the fifth day off. \"This is an imperious, dictatorial, tin-ear approach to management,\" the person said. \"It's not about efficiency; it's just about vindictiveness. There are ways to achieve the overall goal of serving the American people well, but this is not that.\"",
      "",
      "Changes to Work/Life Balance",
      "",
      "With this change, \"people's work/life balance is about to be completely tipped over,\" the person continued. They noted that \"the flexibility of remote work allowed them to create lives where they were much more productive as parents and still got their work done; if they had to do a carpool at 3 p.m., they could do that and work into the evening. I would get emails from people who were still working at 7 or 8 p.m. But you can't do that if you're in the office 5 days a week with inflexible workplace rules.\"",
      "",
      "Another employee said that telework made it easier to work longer hours when necessary. Before telework, \"it would take me an hour to get into work in the morning and maybe 90 minutes or longer to get home in the afternoon,\" they said, explaining that they worked a 7 a.m.-to-3:30 p.m. shift. But with telework, \"I could work before 7 or after 3:30, and that has happened commonly  --  things come up and require more than just the 8 hours that you do on Monday through Friday.\"",
      "",
      "One thing that might affect whether and when HHS employees return to the office full-time is any collective bargaining agreements that employee unions have with the federal government. \"In the OPM memo, they indicated that there were some issues that need to be resolved through the collective bargaining process before employees that were represented by the unions could actually return to the office,\" the employee added.

      "The two main candidates vying for Ecuador\u2019s presidency never campaigned in Cochapamba",
      "COCHAPAMBA, Ecuador -- The two candidates vying for Ecuador\u2019s presidency in a second-round run-off never campaigned in Cochapamba. Their faces are nowhere to be seen in this remote Indigenous community in the Ecuadorian highlands. Yet, their eyes are set on this and other small towns across the Andean country that will be key in the April 13 election, which will give the winner a full four-year term.",
      "People here are loyal to Indigenous leader Leonidas Iza, who appeared on Sunday\u2019s ballot but finished a distant third after receiving half a million votes. In April, however, they will have to decide between President Daniel Noboa or leftist lawyer Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "The run-off will be a repeat of the 2023 snap election, prompted by the dissolution of the National Assembly, in which Noboa earned a truncated 16-month presidency after the wealthy businessman campaigned on controlling Ecuador\u2019s crime wave of recent years.",
      "Situated at more than 3,600 meters (12,000 feet) above sea level, Cochapamba is home to approximately 6,000 people, whose livelihoods center around cultivating and selling white onions. They are all Indigenous and speak Kichwa and Spanish.",
      "Last Sunday, residents of Cochapamba went out to vote, with some walking for up to two hours to reach a poll station and cast their votes.",
      "While the official results from the National Electoral Council have not yet been broken down to such a local level, the official tally shows that in Sunday\u2019s vote, the province of Cotopaxi \u2014 where Cochapamba is located \u2014 37.6% voted for Noboa and 29.3% for the Indigenous leader Iza. Gonz\u00e1lez came in third, with 27.7% of the vote.",
      "In 2023, in the second round that again pitted Noboa against Gonz\u00e1lez, more than 72% of Cochapamba voters favored the former, a candidate they have never seen in person. It now remains to be seen who they will support in three months.",
      "\u201cWe thought (Noboa) was a young man who was really going to make a difference, but up to this point, at least for me, he has lied,\u201d said Fernando Perdomo, a 46-year-old member of the Decentralized Autonomous Government (GAD), as the local authority in Cochapamba is called.",
      "As for Gonz\u00e1lez, a lawyer with limited political experience, locals view her with distrust as the political heir of former President Rafael Correa, who governed Ecuador from 2007 through 2017. He grew increasingly authoritarian in the latter years of his presidency and was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal.",
      "Correa \u201cdisdained Indigenous people,\u201d said Perdomo, adding that now the local community is waiting for instructions from the leadership of the confederation of Indigenous peoples of Ecuador to decide which candidate they will support in the runoff.",
      "Yet, the overall mood in Cochapamba is of distrust \u2014 and disappointment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be deeply disappointed if all the candidates' promises were forgotten,\u201d said Gloria Llugsha, a 28-year-old mother of two. In her view, presidents only remember the people when they need their support.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Elephants trumpeted, touched trunks and flapped their oversized ears upon reuniting with their herd after a complex, five-day move from an urban Australian zoo to a much larger enclosure.",
      "The nine Asian elephants were transported 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Melbourne Zoo in the heart of the city to an enclosure 10 times bigger at the Werribee Open Range Zoo, Zoos Victoria said on Thursday. Police escorts and synchronized traffic lights aided their journey in three convoys of trucks.",
      "The animals' reactions demonstrated they were happy with their move, the elephants\u2019 manager Erin Gardiner said.",
      "\u201cThe behaviors that we saw that indicated to us that they felt really comfortable and also excited to see each other were lots of ear flapping, trunk touching, lots of vocalizations,\u201d Gardiner said.",
      "\u201cSo, roaring, trumpeting, tweaks and squeaks. And so all those interactions helped us understand that they are happy to see each other and feeling comfortable. By the afternoon, those calves were playing together and interacting and I just couldn\u2019t believe how well they traveled,\u201d Gardiner added.",
      "Planning the move began almost two years ago by training the elephants to enter and exit the transport crates, veterinarian Bonnie McMeekin said.",
      "\u201cWithout that training and comfort, I think it would have been really hard to do it safely,\u201d McMeekin said.",
      "The elephants weighing a combined 23 metric tons (25 U.S. tons) were given mild sedatives to reduce their stress during their 40-minute journeys. The adults were also tethered around their ankles to hold them steady on the road.",
      "The trucks mostly traveled around 60 kph (37 mph) but took turns cautiously, McMeekin said. The crates were air-conditioned and purpose built, three of them specifically for mothers and calves to travel together.",
      "The herd has one adult male, five adult females and three calves, all 2 years old.",
      "The adult male, who is the most solitary member of the herd, made the journey alone on Feb. 6 in a crate hoisted onto a truck by a crane. On Saturday, one truck carried an aunt and another carried a crate with a mother and calf. Two mothers with calves plus the herd matriarch followed in three crates on Monday, when the herd was reunited.",
      "McMeekin said two days was a long time for females in a herd to be separated.",
      "The herd on Wednesday was introduced into their new 21-hectare (52-acre) enclosure that has two 3.5-meter- (11-foot-) deep swimming pools. The enclosure is as big as the entire Melbourne Zoo where the herd had outgrown their 2-hectare (5-acre) habitat.",
      "Their new 88 million Australian dollar ($55 million) home has mud wallows, specially designed elephant barns and a communal sleeping area filled with 3,300 metric tons (3,600 U.S. tones) of sand.",
      "The herd will be given weeks to settle into their new home before the habitat is opened to the public.",

      "BRUSSELS -- Close to 100,000 protesters thronged the center of Brussels on Thursday while airports and public transport were largely paralyzed as trade unions took their ire to the streets over drastic plans of the new center-right government to revamp some of the foundations on which the nation's welfare state was built.",
      "Reductions in pensions and cuts for public service personnel were central themes as the country's three main unions joined hands to confront the new government of Prime Minister Bart De Wever, whose program to take on massive government debt includes measures that weigh heavy on the lower-income working classes.",
      "\u201cThe strongest shoulders have to carry the heaviest load,\u201d said Bert Engelaar, secretary general of the Socialist trade union. \u201cThe wealthiest will have to contribute more and that is not at all the case today.\"",
      "Beyond the protests, Brussels international airport was closed down for departures and buses and trams were largely left idle.",
      "The themes reverberate all around Europe where a sluggish economy is driving governments to cut into social privileges that were long held sacrosanct. It holds especially true for Belgium, a nation that has debt totaling just over 100% of GDP, putting it among the worst in the 27-nation EU.",
      "Acerbating the budgetary crisis, is increasing pressure from Belgium's NATO partners and especially the United States to increase the defense budget in line with the threshold of 2% of gross domestic product. Belgium, home to NATO headquarters, currently spends just 1.3%, leaving it one of of the four worst among NATO's 32 members and the very last when it comes to equipment expenditure.",
      "Defense minister Theo Francken insisted Thursday things would be turned around. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the extra money. Belgium is a rich country. We will find the money,\" Francken said at a meeting of NATO defense ministers across town. \"We will do what\u2019s needed.\u201d",
      "The announcement of money to be spent on defense and not on pensions gave an extra incentive for the demonstration, Engelaar said.",
      "\"The choice was made for massive investments in defense, scaring people as if Mr. Putin could be in Brussels as of tomorrow,\u201d he said in reference to the Russian leader.",
      "The boisterous crowds \u2014 estimated at 60,000 by police and at over 100,000 by the unions \u2014 marching through Brussels specifically targeted the government for plans to cut social services, and especially pensions.",
      "De Wever, like Francken from the Flemish nationalist N-VA party, brought an eclectic mix of five parties together to break a 7-month deadlock in coalition talks, with the Flemish socialists as the only ones to lean somewhat to the left.",
      "At parliament on Thursday, he insisted that \u201cthe reforms will be gradual and will have social justice as a guiding light.\u201d",
      "In Flanders, the Vooruit socialist party has said it will do as much as possible to safeguard the cornerstones of Belgium\u2019s welfare society, even though cuts are inevitable.",
      "\"The house is on fire so we need to take measures today,\u201d Socialist Minister Rob Beenders told VRT network.",
      "The unions are set to hold a general strike on March 31 to keep pressure on the government."

      "Vance, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is due to sit down Friday with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference to discuss President Donald Trump\u2019s intensifying push for Ukraine and Russia to begin negotiations to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II.",
      "But first Vance is stopping at the solemn memorial that is a powerful reminder of the Nazis' World War II-era atrocities and the U.S. and Western allies' slowness to take decisive action to confront Adolf Hitler and the rise of his violent nationalist ideology.",
      "Dachau was established in 1933 \u2014 the same year Hitler took power \u2014 as one of the first concentration camps. More than 200,000 people from across Europe were held at the camp, and over 40,000 prisoners died there in horrendous conditions. U.S. soldiers completed the liberation on April 29, 1945.",
      "Vance is in the midst of a five-day visit to France and Germany, his first overseas travel since becoming vice president last month. His wife, Usha Vance, is expected to join him for the Dachau visit.",
      "The moment at Dachau will offer Vance a chance to reflect on the scourges of war just as his boss, Donald Trump, is ratcheting up his efforts to end the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Trump on Wednesday spoke separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy. Trump said that he and Putin agreed it was time to \u201cstart negotiations immediately\u201d to end the war.",
      "And as Trump announced his agreement on negotiations with Putin, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops.",
      "In addition to his talks with Zelenskyy, Vance is scheduled to deliver an address on Friday to the annual Munich Security Conference.",
      "The war in Europe and NATO members' defense spending are expected to be front and center for the world leaders gathering in Munich.",
      "Vance, like Trump, has been a sharp critic of U.S. allies' spending what the administration deems as too little on their defense budgets.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration has been clear that we care a lot about Europe,\u201d Vance said during a meeting this week with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cBut we also want to make sure that we're engaged in a security partnership that's both good for Europe and the United States.\u201d",
      "Over nearly three years of war, 50 countries \u2014 known as the Ukraine Contact Group \u2014 have collectively provided Ukraine with more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including more than $66.5 billion from the U.S., which has served as chair of the group since its creation.",
      "Trump in his 2024 campaign derided the enormous amount of U.S. military aid poured into Ukraine and vowed to end the conflict within 24 hours of returning to the White House.",
      "Since his November election victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, Trump and his advisers have dialed back on their boldest timelines and set a goal of ending the war in about six months.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- After 16 months of excruciating uncertainty, Idit Ohel finally received word this week that her 24-year-old son, a hostage in Gaza, is still alive.",
      "She said she fainted upon hearing the brutal details of his captivity from freed hostages who had been held with him by Hamas since Oct. 7, 2023. Bound by chains in an underground tunnel, Alon Ohel has subsisted on a piece of bread or less each day.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen sunlight in 493 days,\u201d she told reporters on Monday.",
      "As the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas seems increasingly at risk of falling apart \u2014 Hamas says it will not free three hostages on Saturday as planned, and Israel says it's ready to resume the war if it doesn't \u2014 families of the hostages are struggling to maintain hope. They are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to give up on the ceasefire framework, and to speed up the timeline of releases if possible.",
      "Their worries about the ceasefire collapsing have been exacerbated by President Donald Trump's demand that all of the hostages be freed by Saturday \u2014 and his insistence that Gaza be emptied of all Palestinians and redeveloped as a tourist enclave controlled by the United States.",
      "The emaciated state of three hostages released last Saturday has infuriated Israelis and terrified families of the remaining hostages, especially as more details come out about the conditions of their captivity.",
      "The situation is especially difficult for relatives of hostages who are not on the list of 33 hostages expected to be released in the ceasefire's first, six-week phase, which began on Jan. 19. The agreement requires Israel to free 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, whose families are also worried about how their enemy treats them.",
      "Two hostages released on Saturday, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi, were held together with Alon Ohel, and a fourth hostage, Eliya Cohen. The four were held underground since their kidnapping, Idit Ohel said.",
      "Cohen is expected to be released in the ceasefire's first stage; Ohel would be freed in the second stage, if Israel and Hamas reach that point.",
      "Levy, Ohel, and Cohen were kidnapped from a bomb shelter near a music festival in southern Israel, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli who was killed in captivity in August.",
      "\u201cIt breaks my heart to know he was chained and to know what happened to him in the tunnels from people in the tunnels,\u201d Cohen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Ziv Abud, 27, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "The returned hostages said that Cohen had lost more than 20 kilograms (44 pounds) and had a bullet in his leg that did not receive medical attention. While they were with him, Cohen was unaware that Abud had survived the Hamas attack on the bomb shelter where they were hiding.",
      "During the Oct. 7 attack, militants tossed grenades and sprayed bullets inside the concrete bomb shelter near the music festival, where almost 30 people had crammed inside. At least 16 people inside the shelter were killed.",
      "Abud said she was protected by the crush of bodies above her. Going in and out of consciousness, she spent hours laying beneath the bodies of her nephew and his girlfriend.",
      "For families of hostages who are not scheduled for release in the first phase of the ceasefire, its uncertainty is even more difficult to bear.",
      "Israel and Hamas were set last week to begin talks on a second phase of the ceasefire that would include an end to the war and the release of the remaining hostages. But those efforts have been frozen while the two sides trade accusations about whether the other is living up to the terms of the first phase.",
      "Tamir Nimrodi, 20, an Israeli soldier kidnapped from his post at a main crossing between Israel and Gaza, is not on the list to be freed in the first stage.",
      "His mother, Herut, said Hamas\u2019 plan to delay the next hostage release came as a shock.",
      "\u201cWe try to analyze it, think, what are the possibilities? Is this psychological terrorism they are pulling on us?\u201d she said.",
      "It\u2019s been difficult watching the hostage releases over the past few weeks, Nimrodi said, especially the emotional videos of hostages reuniting with their families.",
      "On the one hand, each reunion is a step closer to bringing back her son, whom she described as a creative person who loves riding horses and drinking sweet cocktails made with pineapple juice. But Nimrodi does not know if her son, who also holds German citizenship, is alive.",
      "The other two soldiers he was kidnapped with were killed, and she has not received any sign of life from him.",
      "\u201cI know there is a chance I won\u2019t get to the point where I can hold my son,\u201d she said.",
      "According to Israeli media, returning hostages have provided proof of life for at least seven Israeli hostages, including Cohen and Ohel.",
      "Nimrodi doesn\u2019t know what is worse \u2014 to believe her son is dead, or to receive information that he is alive, but held in conditions like Alon Ohel. \u201cI\u2019m scared if Tamir is still alive, I have no idea what he\u2019s going through, I\u2019m scared to even imagine,\u201d she said.",
      "Idit Ohel received the information about her son's condition less than an hour before she went on Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news program earlier this week.",
      "She sat at the news desk sobbing on live TV, pleading with the government to continue to the second stage of the ceasefire and bring all of the hostages home as soon as possible.",
      "Alon, who also has German and Serbian citizenship, is a talented pianist. The family has placed pianos across Israel in his honor, many of which are yellow, the color associated with the struggle for the hostages.",
      "The family marked Alon's second birthday in captivity on Monday evening in Tel Aviv, where his mother addressed the Israeli government. \u201cAfter all the sights you saw, after all the testimonies you heard from the survivors of captivity, how do you allow this situation to continue?\u201d she said.",
      "Alon did remember his younger sister, Inbar, had a birthday on Saturday and delivered her a message through the hostages who were released that day.",
      "\u201cShe got her birthday wish, to hear from her brother, which is incredible,\u201d Idit said, through tears."

The region has already seen a significant mobilization of fire departments, police, coast guard, and armed forces mostly on Santorini where thousands of residents and seasonal workers have left the island.",

      "Students stood outside shuttered classrooms and roamed aimlessly on Tuesday, when teachers started a two-day strike.",
      "The action by teachers and students comes at a time when public criticism of the government is becoming rarer. Teachers say the strike is significant amid a gradual shrinking of rights, including for women, the press and opposition parties.",

      "SARMADA, Syria -- In the town of Sarmada in northern Syria, Dr. Mohammad Fares unlocked a clinic that once bustled with patients. Now it's empty, and shelves of medicine reduced to a few boxes of bandages and expired drugs.",
      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",
      "Their already grim camps swelled again in 2023 after a deadly magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Turkey and northern Syria. Since the fall of Assad, some displaced Syrians have begun to return home, but many have no homes left.",
      "Fares\u2019 clinic in Sarmada used to support 16 camps in the region, assisting approximately 35,000 people. Since the aid freeze, 10 such clinics receiving USAID funding had to close, and Doctors of the World had to lay off 184 people, officials with the organization said.",
      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals. The cessation of work in these clinics will put increased pressure on emergency hospitals and other healthcare facilities\"",

      "\"Our analysis shows that withdrawing all of USAID\u2019s support in Syria would be equivalent to a devastating shock of 5% to its already struggling economy. This is among the largest impacts on any recipient.\" said Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Washington based Center for Global Development.",
      "The U.S. had been providing 25 cents in foreign aid for every $100 of U.S. income, Mitchell said, but that relatively small contribution had outsized impact: \u201cWithout U.S. support in places like Gaza and Syria, the world will become a more dangerous place.\"",

      "\u201cWe have a grant that supports survivors of torture and sexual assault,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cAre these services life-saving or not? Likely they will be shut down.\u201d",
      "USAID and the U.S. government did not respond to questions. Elsewhere, USAID workers and aid officials have said funding hasn't resumed despite waivers, or USAID staffers who would process them are now gone.",

      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army announced Thursday it is coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates who are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border.

      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",

      "Greek lawmakers have elected a former parliament speaker and leading advocate for the return of the disputed Parthenon sculptures from the British Museum as the country\u2019s new president",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greek lawmakers on Wednesday elected as president a former parliamentary speaker and leading advocate for the return of the disputed Parthenon sculptures from the British Museum in London.",
      "Constantine Tassoulas, 65, was elected with 160 votes in the 300-member parliament in the fourth round of voting for the largely ceremonial post. He takes over from Katerina Sakellaropoulou, the first woman to serve as Greece's head of state, who was not nominated for a second five-year term.",
      "Speaking shortly after the results were formally announced, Tassoulas said his election was \u201ca supreme honor for me, but above all a precious responsibility.\u201d",
      "A lawyer by trade, Tassoulas is also a member of the governing center-right New Democracy party and served as culture minister a decade ago, helping reinvigorate Greece\u2019s campaign to reclaim the 2,500-year-old Parthenon sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles.",
      "During his tenure as culture minister, he hosted lawyer Amal Clooney in Athens, who lent her support to the Greek bid for the sculptures\u2019 return. Clooney, the wife of actor George Clooney, helped raise international awareness of the campaign.",
      "The sculptures were removed from the Acropolis in Athens by British diplomat Lord Elgin in the early 1800s and have since been kept in the British Museum. The Greek government contends their removal was illegal and has long sought their return, seeking to reunite them with other Parthenon artifacts displayed in a museum in the Greek capital.",
      "Greek officials believe the return of the sculptures is more likely now due to the U.K. Labour government\u2019s perceived openness to loan agreements. Ongoing discussions on a potential arrangement would likely include an offer to facilitate rotating exhibitions of ancient Greek artifacts at the British Museum.",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says NATO membership for Ukraine is unrealistic and in sweeping remarks suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and in sweeping remarks suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops.",
      "Hegseth's strident comments came during the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration. Allies have been waiting to hear how much continued military and financial support Washington intends to provide to the Ukrainian government.",
      "What they heard was that President Donald Trump is intent on getting Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine, including a possible peacekeeping force that would not include U.S. troops. Hegseth said the force should not have Article Five protections, which could require the U.S. or the 31 other nations of the NATO alliance to come to the aid of those forces if they end up in contact with Russian forces.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s stark message, and his insistence that Russia should keep some territory that Ukraine wants back, is likely to complicate talks later this week between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance and other senior American officials at a major security security conference in Munich.",
      "\u201cThe United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\u201d Hegseth said, as Kyiv\u2019s backers gathered at NATO headquarters for a meeting to drum up more arms and ammunition for the war, which will soon enter its fourth year.",
      "All 32 allies must agree for a country to join NATO, meaning that every member has a veto.",
      "\u201cInstead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cTo be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Hegseth insisted that NATO should play no role in any future military mission to police the peace in Ukraine and that any peacekeeping troops should not be covered by the part of NATO\u2019s founding treaty that obliges all allies to come to the aid of any member under attack.",
      "Article Five has been activated only once, when European allies and Canada used the collective security guarantee to help the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks on New York and Washington.",
      "Hegseth also said Europe \"must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.\u201d Ukraine currently relies equally on Europe and the U.S. for about 30% each of its defense needs. The rest is produced by Ukraine itself.",
      "Addressing the allies of Ukraine known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, he also insisted that Ukraine\u2019s Western backers must abandon the \u201cillusionary goal\u201d of returning the country to its pre-2014 borders, before Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and seized parts of eastern Ukraine.",
      "\u201cMembers of this contact group must meet the moment,\u201d Hegseth said to the approximately 50 member countries that have provided support to Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe hear you,\u201d U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's opening remarks. Both Hegseth and Healey spoke in front of journalists at the top of a closed-door session in Brussels to discuss future aid to Ukraine.",
      "Over nearly three years, those 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine with more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance, including more than $66.5 billion from the U.S., which has served as the chair of the group since its creation.",
      "But the meeting this week was convened by the United Kingdom, and no decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn\u2019t expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won\u2019t stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "Trump has promised to end the war quickly. He\u2019s complained that it\u2019s costing American taxpayers too much money and suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Hegseth in his remarks said that NATO member nations also need to significantly increase defense spending to 5% of their budgets \u2014 a high mark that the U.S. does not presently meet either.",
      "\u201cThe United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependence. Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security,\" Hegseth said.",
      "European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 of them are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year's target of spending 2% of gross domestic product, but a third still fall short.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren\u2019t favorable to Ukraine.",
      "Before Hegseth spoke, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told The Associated Press that Putin will only negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine if its backers continue to provide enough weapons and ammunition.",
      "\u201cWe have to make sure that he has no other option, and that means to force him to the table,\u201d Rutte said. \u201cHe needs to understand that we will not give up on Ukraine. We have to make sure that we have maximum economic impact on Russia.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's remarks come a day after American history teacher Marc Vogel returned safely to the U.S. after three years in a Russian prison. The White House suggested that his release could help to advance negotiations on ending the war.",
      "Trump said another American, someone \u201cvery special,\u201d would be released Wednesday, though he declined to name the person or say from what country. The president did not say what the United States exchanged for Fogel\u2019s release.",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's speech on Ukraine this week has thrown NATO into disarray",
      "BRUSSELS -- In just one speech by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week, the most powerful member of NATO has thrown the world\u2019s biggest military alliance into disarray, raising troubling questions about America\u2019s commitment to European security.",
      "Hegseth told almost 50 of Ukraine \u2019s Western backers on Wednesday that he had joined their meeting \u201cto directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must \u2014 and we are \u2014 focusing on security of our own borders,\u201d he said.",
      "Reading the riot act to U.S. allies, Hegseth said that Ukraine will not get all its territory back from Russia and will not be allowed to join NATO, which would provide the ultimate security guarantee to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin never attacks it again.",
      "He insisted NATO will not be involved in any future force that might be required to police the peace in Ukraine. European and other nations will, but the Europeans will have to pay for it. No American troops would take part in such an operation, he warned.",
      "Beyond that, Hegseth said that NATO will not come to the rescue of any European nation involved in that force if it is attacked by Russia. It\u2019s unclear what role the U.S. would play, if any, although Russia is sure to test the force\u2019s resolve if America does not provide backup.",
      "French Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu said that NATO faces \u201ca real moment of truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo say that it\u2019s the biggest and most robust alliance in history is true, historically speaking. But the real question is will that still be the case in 10 or 15 years,\u201d he said.",
      "Founded in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed by 12 nations to counter the threat to European security posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Dealing with Moscow is in its DNA. Keeping the peace outside the Euro-Atlantic area is not.",
      "NATO\u2019s ranks have grown since the Washington Treaty was signed 75 years ago \u2014 to 32 countries after Sweden joined last year, worried by an increasingly aggressive Russia.",
      "NATO\u2019s collective security guarantee \u2014 Article 5 of the treaty \u2014 underpins its credibility.",
      "It\u2019s a political commitment by all member countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or territory might be under attack. Hegseth has now raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to that pledge, although he did say that his country is not planning to leave the alliance.",
      "NATO\u2019s doors are open to any European country that wants to join and can meet the requirements and obligations. Importantly, NATO takes its decisions by consensus, so every member has a veto. This week, Hegseth took Ukraine\u2019s candidacy off the table.",
      "The United States is the most powerful member. It spends much more on defense than any other ally and far outweighs its partners in terms of military muscle. So Washington drives the agenda. Hegseth\u2019s speech, essentially saying \u201cthis is how it\u2019s going to be,\u201d was further proof.",
      "NATO\u2019s day-to-day work is led by former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.",
      "As NATO\u2019s top civilian official, he chairs almost weekly meetings of ambassadors in the North Atlantic Council at its Brussels headquarters. He chairs other \u201cNACs\u201d at ministerial level and summits of heads of state and government. Rutte runs NATO HQ, tries to encourage consensus and speaks on behalf of all 32 members.",
      "NATO\u2019s military headquarters is based nearby in Mons, Belgium. It is always run by a top U.S. officer. The current supreme allied commander Europe is Army Gen. Christopher Cavoli.",
      "Even though most allies believe that Russia could pose an existential threat to Europe, NATO itself is not arming Ukraine. As an organization, NATO possesses no weapons of any kind. Collectively, the alliance provides only non-lethal support \u2014 fuel, combat rations, medical supplies and body armor, as well as equipment to counter drones or mines.",
      "But members do send arms on their own or in groups. European allies provided 60% of the military support that Ukraine received in 2024.",
      "NATO has also helped Ukraine\u2019s armed forces shift from Soviet-era military doctrine to modern thinking, and has strengthened Ukraine\u2019s defense and security institutions.",
      "Much of what NATO does for Ukraine, and indeed for global security, is misunderstood. Often the alliance is thought of as the sum of all U.S. relations with its European partners, from imposing sanctions and other costs on Russia to sending arms and ammunition.",
      "But as an organization, its brief is limited to the defense by military means of its 32 member countries \u2014 the sacred Three Musketeers-like vow of all for one, one for all \u2014 and a commitment to help keep the peace in Europe and North America.",
      "At least that was the case until this week.",
      "While some allies have left open the possibility of sending military personnel to Ukraine, NATO itself has no plans to do this, and Hegseth ended any speculation over whether it might.",
      "But a key part of the commitment for allies to defend one another is to deter Russia, or any other adversary, from launching an attack in the first place. Finland and Sweden joined NATO recently because of this concern.",
      "With the war in Ukraine soon to enter its fourth year, NATO has 500,000 military personnel on high readiness to counter any attack, whether it be on land, at sea, by air or in cyberspace.",
      "Due to high U.S. defense spending over many years, America\u2019s armed forces benefit not only from greater troop numbers and superior weapons but also from significant transport and logistics assets.",
      "Other allies are starting to spend more, though. After years of cuts, NATO members committed to ramp up their national defense budgets in 2014 when Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula.",
      "The aim was for each ally to be spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense within a decade. In 2023, they agreed to make 2% a spending floor, rather than a ceiling. A record 23 countries were expected reach that spending target last year, up from only three a decade ago.",
      "But Rutte has said they will need to raise that to 3% or more.",
      "France\u2019s Lecornu claims that the wrangling over defense spending is \u201ca false debate\u201d as governments and parliaments across Europe are already approving more weapons purchases and bigger military budgets, all while arming Ukraine so it can defend itself."

      "PARIS -- Western allies and Arab countries are gathering in Paris on Thursday for an international conference on Syria to discuss the country\u2019s future after the fall of former Syrian president Bashar Assad and amid uncertainty over the United States' commitment to the region.",
      "It\u2019s the third conference on Syria since Assad was ousted in December, and the first since President Donald Trump's administration took over in the U.S.",
      "Trump's controversial decision to freeze foreign assistance has raised concerns in Syria, a country that had depended on hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from the U.S. and now left in ruins by a civil war.",
      "The Trump administration is pulling almost all USAID workers out of the field worldwide, all but ending a six-decade mission meant to shore up American security by fighting starvation, funding education and working to end epidemics.",
      "While many Syrians were happy to see the rule of Assad come to an abrupt end in December, analysts have warned that the honeymoon period for the country\u2019s new rulers may be short-lived if they are not able to jumpstart the country\u2019s battered economy.",
      "An end to the sanctions imposed during Assad\u2019s time will be key to that, but sanctions are not the only issue.",
      "More aid is crucial to achieve a peaceful reconstruction during the post-Assad transition. The country needs massive investment to rebuild housing, electricity, water and transportation infrastructure after nearly 14 years of war. The United Nations in 2017 estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion, while some experts now say the number could reach at least $400 billion.",
      "With few productive sectors and government employees making wages equivalent to about $20 per month, Syria has grown increasingly dependent on remittances and humanitarian aid. But the flow of aid was throttled after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month.",
      "The effects were particularly dire in the country\u2019s northwest, a formerly rebel-held enclave that hosts millions of people displaced from other areas by the country\u2019s civil war. Many of them live in sprawling tent camps.",
      "The freeze on USAID funding forced clinics serving many of those camps to shut down, and nonprofits laid off local staff. In northeastern Syria, a camp housing thousands of family members of Islamic State fighters was thrown into chaos when the group providing services there was forced to briefly stop work.",

      "Uncertainty also surrounds the future of U.S. military support in the region.",
      "In 2019 during his first term, Trump decided on a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops form the northeast of Syria before he halted the plans. And in December last year, when rebels were on their way to topple Assad, Trump said the United States should not \u201c dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war.\u201d",
      "Now that Syria\u2019s new leader Ahmad al-Sharaa is trying to consolidate his power, the U.S intentions in the region remain unclear.",
      "A French diplomatic official confirmed the presence of a U.S. representative at the conference, but said \u201cour understanding is that the new U.S. administration is still in the review process regarding Syria, it does not seem (the U.S. position) will be clarified at that conference.\u201d The official spoke anonymously in line with the French presidency's customary practices.",
      "The commander of the main U.S.-backed force in Syria recently said that U.S. troops should stay in Syria because the Islamic State group will benefit from a withdrawal.",
      "Since Damascus fell on Dec. 8 and Assad fled to Moscow, the new leadership has yet to lay out a clear vision of how the country will be governed.",
      "The Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2013 a former al-Qaida affiliate that the EU and U.N. consider to be a terrorist organization \u2013 has established itself as Syria\u2019s de facto rulers after coordinating with the southern fighters during the offensive late last year.",
      "French organizers said the three main goals of the meeting, which is not a pledging conference, are to coordinate efforts to support a peaceful transition, organize cooperation and aid from neighbours and partners, and to continue talks on the fight against impunity.",

It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded Britain and some 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement.",
      "The basilica was part of the forum, the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London, where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city\u2019s governance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s thetsite beating heart of the city,\u201d said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. \u201cIt kind of towers above the city. And so it\u2019s a real symbol of Roman power and authority.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the early stages of London here, but it\u2019s a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy,\u201d he said.",
      "Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center.",
      "Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the \u201cabsolutely massive\u201d foundations discovered in several test pits suggests an \u201cextraordinary\u201d level of preservation.",
      "Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses \u2014 even ancient trash \u2014 could give glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners.",
      "Property developers in Britain routinely have to consult archaeologists as part of their planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Saxon jewelry to medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims.",
      "The latest discovery adds to the scant traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of ancient wall, a portion of amphitheater beneath the Guildhall and a temple to the god Mithras which lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg.",
      "\"We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,\u201d Henderson-Schwartz said. \u201cBut this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.\u201d",

      "One of 51 children interviewed by the human rights group said he was constantly pressured by a gang to fight alongside it.",
      "\u201cThey killed people in front of me and asked me to burn their bodies. But I don\u2019t have the heart for that,\u201d the unidentified boy was quoted as saying.",
      "An estimated 30% to 50% of gang members are now children, according to UNICEF.",
      "Amnesty International said the children \u201chad no choice, and that their involvement was predominantly out of hunger or fear.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is on the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine's government.",
      "Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth's predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.",
      "No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn't expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it's costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren't favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.",
      "Washington's 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump's new administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.",
      "However, a third of members still haven't reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn't commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d",
      "He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.",
      "NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26.",

    "story": [
      "During a time of pressure on public broadcasters, PBS says that it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion and firing the two executives who staffed it",
      "NEW YORK -- PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order, firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio girds for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than it has faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \u201cwe were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\u201d",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it is filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \u201cWe're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\u201d Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \u201csystemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\u201d",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee posted \u201clet's defund PBS and NPR\u201d on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\u201cI think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cI never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\u201d",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \u201cthere is bias at play\u201d when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \u201cWe take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\u201d she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\u201cI'm always an optimistic person,\u201d Kerger said, \u201cbut I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

    "summary": "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
    "story": [
      "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
      "BRUGES, Belgium -- St. Valentine chocolates always seek to show how deep your love is. This year, it might just also show how deep your pockets are.",
      "With the price of cocoa beans setting unprecedented records on the commodities market, it will certainly turn the gift of love into a bigger financial commitment than it once was. Turns out that if love is reputed to be eternal, a low price for cocoa, the essential ingredient in chocolate, is not.",
      "\u201cThe price increase of cocoa is absolutely spectacular, now for 2, 2\u00bd years,\u201d said Philippe de Sellier, the head of both Leonidas and Belgian chocolate federation Choprabisco. When it stood at less than $2,000 a ton in the summer of 2022, it really took over early last year and peaked at well over $12,000 during the Christmas season and has been hovering around the $10,000 mark since.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing unprecedented prices. They haven't been this high for the last 50 years,\u201d said Bart Van Besien, policy adviser of the Oxfam fair trade group. And the impact can be felt deep in chocolate gourmet country Belgium, where some of its 280 chocolate companies are left with a bleeding heart during Valentine's week.",
      "Dominque Persoone, owner of the famed Chocolate Line brand, still has plenty of beans to grind in his workshop in Bruges, but considers himself lucky, partly because he also has his own cocoa plantation in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of colleagues who are really in trouble, because the price is too high,\" he said. \u201cIf you don't have good contacts, they just don't deliver anymore.\u201d",
      "Some just close for Valentine, he said, turning one of the few financial bonanzas of the year into a forced vacation, hoping that Easter, with its eggs and bunnies, will bring better tidings. Many chocolatiers can't go for the usual profit margins and turn all the extra costs of the cocoa prices over to their customers. Persoone said that his chocolates increased in price by 20% over the last year alone while de Selliers said that it depends very much from producer to producer.",
      "The shock of cocoa prices pretty much is a metaphorical perfect storm, mixing climate, disease, commodity speculation, the plight of farmers and social ascendency around the world into one heady mix.",
      "\u201cThe drop that has happened now in production was directly linked to climate change,\u201d said Van Besien, blaming changes in annual rain and drought patterns in western Africa that weakened the sensitive trees in key production areas. Persoone also said that the temperature differences between night and day increased in the small strip of land around the equator where the trees can thrive. Compounded by disease, it made sure too many harvests failed.",
      "At the same time across the world, populations lifted themselves out of poverty, middle classes expanded in places like China and the craving for the delicacy increased.",
      "And making matters worse, the years of slumping prices for the beans simply drove farmers off the land to look for a better future in the cities and pushed production further down. De Selliers said that \u201c60 % of cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana and these farmers have to make a better living. It is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Persoone concurred: \u201cWe didn't pay enough to have an honest price for the farmers.\u201d",
      "So, strangely enough, low prices then, help cause high prices now.",
      "\u201cThe big irony in the cocoa industry is that farmers are now getting a fair price at the moment they are abandoning cocoa farming,\u201d Van Besien said. \u201cWith the price they are getting right now, they could have invested in sustainable practices. They could have sent their children to school.\u201d",
      "Does it mean a premier box of chocolates is a guilty pleasure on Valentine's Day?",
      "\u201cYeah, the guilt question .... It's one that always works,\u201d said Van Besien, the fair trade expert. \u201cWe could not survive if we would be thinking about these things all the time,\u201d arguing that legislation should trump consumer emotions.",
      "\u201cWe should have laws that make buying cocoa below the cost of the production something illegal. And it should not be up to the consumer to make this decision,\u201d he said. Both de Selliers and Persoone hope that if the prices drop down again, they stay around the $5,000 or $6,000 mark.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope the money goes to the farmers,\u201d Persoone said.",
      "So in the meantime, despite the price hikes, the chocolate shouldn't leave too bitter a taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small luxury that most people still can afford,\u201d Persoone said. \"I hope it stays like this.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is just the next step in this process,\u201d House Speaker Destin Hall told Tuesday's committee meeting. \"Somebody asked me earlier, \u2018How many bills are we going to need to do this?\u2019 And my answer is \u2014 and I know you all feel the same \u2014 it\u2019s going to be as many as it takes for us to get it done to rebuild western North Carolina.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported that Helene damaged 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads, bridges and culverts. State officials projected the storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.",
      "Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "The state House proposal seeks to maximize federal matching funds, avoid mistakes from previous storm recovery efforts and prevent the distribution of too much money to programs ill-equipped to get it out the door, Bell said.",
      "\"This body is very strategic in what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Bell said Wednesday.",
      "Adjustments that House Republicans made this week to their preliminary bill included shifting $75 million to create a state Agriculture Department program to address agricultural crop and infrastructure losses.",
      "Another $60 million initially earmarked for repairs of state facilities would be used for other purposes. Nearly all of it \u2014 $55 million \u2014 would help small businesses, although not in the form of direct payments, as Stein and other Democrats want.",
      "Instead, the proposed infrastructure grant program would allocate money to local governments to repair \u201cqualifying infrastructure needs\u201d like utilities, broadband and sidewalks that would benefit small businesses trying to reemerge from the storm. Bell said Wednesday that a grant program could be open to abuses by businesses that aren't located specifically in the damaged region.",
      "With Republicans falling one seat short of retaining a veto-proof majority in the General Assembly after the November election, Stein and Democratic allies may be able to yield more leverage to fashion a package to their liking.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Eric Ager of Buncombe County offered an amendment Tuesday to create a direct payment program to small businesses that Stein sought, running it through the state Revenue Department.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing businesses in western North Carolina every day and we\u2019ve got to find a solution,\u201d Ager said, adding that it \u201cwould really go a long way in keeping some folks solvent through to the summer when business picks back up again.\u201d",
      "While Ager pulled his amendment before a vote because earlier committee action took away his funding source, Bell suggested to Ager and later to reporters that new language to help small businesses may be considered.",

      "It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem.",
      "Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Caf\u00e9 celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.",
      "Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy\u2019s reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.",
      "Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.",
      "In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter more than 145 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.",
      "The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.",
      "Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs.",
      "Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said.",
      "The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank.",
      "Changing preferences since then have caused further market strain. Americans are increasingly looking for protein with few added ingredients, and eggs fit that bill.",
      "\u201cConsumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you\u2019re making something with eggs, you know it\u2019s fresh,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "To address animal rights concerns, McDonald\u2019s and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.",
      "\u201cIt makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.",
      "Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.",
      "First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them.",
      "First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.",
      "Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.",
      "\u201cEggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,\u201d Richardson said.",

      "It was 17 years ago when Allen Stanford, a Texan businessman, flew into Lord's \u2014 the so-called \u201chome of cricket\u201d in northwest London \u2014 aboard a private helicopter filled with fake dollar notes in a publicity stunt for a remarkable deal he reached with the ECB: A five-match T20 series between England and superstars from the Caribbean worth $100 million.",

      "The governing body said it still owns The Hundred as a competition and felt it was important the \u201cstructure of the game is retained and owned by the ECB and our members (the counties).\u201d That means the schedule, the formats and the governance of English cricket.",
      "Expect, however, the new investors to make changes to their franchises when it comes to team names, colors and branding in The Hundred from 2026.",
      "Changing the times when matches are played \u2014 to potentially suit Indian audiences, for example \u2014 is \u201cnot on the agenda,\u201d Gould said, because securing strong attendances inside the stadiums is a priority.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday that he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports.",
      "\u201cTODAY IS THE BIG ONE: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!\u201d Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d",
      "The prospect of a dramatic hike on tariffs could send shockwaves through the world economy, possibly depressing growth while also causing inflation to intensify. Trump has maintained that such tariffs will help to create domestic factory jobs, but most economists say they would effectively be a tax increase on U.S. consumers that would add to inflationary pressures.",
      "The Republican president has openly antagonized multiple U.S. trading partners over the past several weeks, levying tariff threats and inviting them to retaliate with import taxes of their own that could send the economy hurtling into a trade war.",
      "Trump has put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports due that country's role in the production of the opioid fentanyl. He also has readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. On top of that, on Monday, he removed the exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. And he's mused about new tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The European Union, Canada and Mexico have countermeasures ready to inflict economic pain on the United States in response to Trump's actions, while China has already taken retaliatory steps with its own tariffs on U.S. energy, agricultural machinery and large-engine autos as well as an antitrust investigation of Google.",
      "Trump has not specified how he defines the term \u201creciprocal\u201d and whether his order would apply only to matching tariffs or to including other foreign taxes that he views as a barrier to exporting American goods.",
      "The White House has argued that charging the same import taxes as other countries do would improve the fairness of trade, potentially raising revenues for the U.S. government while also enabling negotiations that could eventually improve trade.",
      "But Trump is also making a political wager that voters can tolerate higher inflation levels. Price spikes in 2021 and 2022 severely weakened the popularity of then-President Joe Biden, with voters so frustrated by inflation eroding their buying power that they chose last year to put Trump back in the White House to address the problem. Inflation has risen since November's election, with the government reporting on Wednesday that the consumer price index is running at an annual rate of 3%.",
      "The Trump team has decried criticism of its tariffs even as it has acknowledged the likelihood of some financial pain. It says that the tariffs have to be weighed against the possible extension and expansion of Trump's 2017 tax cuts as well as efforts to curb regulations and force savings through the spending freezes and staff reductions in billionaire adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency initiative.",
      "But an obstacle for this approach might be the sequencing of the various policies and the possibilities of a wider trade conflict stifling investment and hiring amid the greater inflationary pressures.",
      "Analysts at the bank Wells Fargo said in a Thursday report that the tariffs would likely hurt growth this year, just as the extended tax cuts could help growth recover in 2026.",
      "\u201cTariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,\" the report said. \u201cThe U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.\u201d"

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- The executive director of a federal control board that oversees Puerto Rico\u2019s finances said that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for the U.S. territory to pay the $8.5 billion bondholders are demanding in a bankruptcy case involving the island's power company.",
      "Robert Mujica Jr. unveiled a new fiscal plan for Puerto Rico's Electric Power Authority on Tuesday, stating that the government can pay creditors $2.6 billion. The plan, requested by a federal judge overseeing the case, does not call for any rate increases to help pay off the company's debt of more than $9 billion and the projected expenses are higher than those in the previous fiscal plan.",
      "The board remains in contentious mediation with creditors as it tries to restructure the only outstanding debt that remains since Puerto Rico declared in 2015 that it could not afford to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and then filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history two years later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gone on for too long,\u201d Mujica said of the case. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to get out of this one.\u201d",
      "Economists have said that the unresolved case has spooked potential investors and hampered economic development on the island.",
      "Mujica noted that officials don\u2019t yet know where they would obtain funding for the $2.6 billion they\u2019re offering, but warned it shouldn\u2019t come from an increase in electric rates given already high power bills and the fragile state of Puerto Rico\u2019s grid.",
      "\u201cThe system needs investment,\u201d Mujica said, adding that all revenue should go into fortifying and improving the grid. \u201cPuerto Ricans deserve to have a utility that is performing and that is reliable.\u201d",
      "The island suffers from chronic power outages that worsened after Hurricane Maria razed the grid when it slammed into Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm in September 2017. However, the grid was already crumbling given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.",
      "Mujica said that if the government agreed to bondholder demands, which total $12 billion including interest, it would mean an electric rate increase of up to eight cents that he says Puerto Ricans cannot afford.",
      "The current offering of $2.6 billion, which represents an 80% reduction of the power company\u2019s debt, has been accepted by 44% of creditors and a third of all bondholders.",
      "Luma Energy, which oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico, says the grid needs up to $25 billion in federal funding through fiscal year 2034 to fully rebuild and maintain the system.",
      "Of the $17 billion expected in funding from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, only $3.2 billion has been disbursed, Mujica said.",
      "\u201cThe system right now is deteriorating faster than the investments are being made,\u201d he said.",

      "Egg prices have reached a record high in the U.S. The consumer price index released on Wednesday confirmed what consumers, bakers and food companies already knew: an ongoing bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 are making eggs terribly expensive right now",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Egg prices reached a record high in the U.S. last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday.",
      "The latest monthly consumer price index confirmed what consumers, bakers and food companies already knew: an ongoing bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 are making eggs terribly expensive right now.",
      "The average price of a dozen Grade A eggs in U.S. cities reached $4.95 in January, eclipsing the previous record of $4.82 set two years earlier and more than double the recent low of $2.04 that was recorded in August 2023.",
      "Of course, that is only the nationwide average. A carton of eggs can cost $10 or more in some places. And specialized varieties, such as organic and cage-free eggs, are even more expensive.",
      "Prices are only going to get worse. Prices always spike around Easter every year because demand is high around the holiday. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted last month that egg prices were likely to go up 20% this year.",
      "And even if consumers can afford eggs, it can be hard to find them at times as some stores have trouble keeping their shelves stocked. Some grocers have imposed limits on how many eggs customers can buy at a time.",
      "The main reason that eggs are more expensive is the bird flu outbreak. When the virus is found on a farm, the entire flock is killed to limit the spread of disease. Because massive egg farms may have millions of birds, just one outbreak may put a dent in the egg supply.",
      "The Agriculture Department says more than 23 million birds were slaughtered last month and more than 18 million were killed in December to limit the spread of the bird flu virus. Those numbers include turkeys and chickens raised for meat, but the vast majority of them were egg-laying chickens.",
      "Egg farmers also face higher feed, fuel and labor costs these days because of inflation. Plus, farmers are investing more in biosecurity measured to try to protect their birds.",
      "Ten states have passed laws allowing the sale of eggs only from cage-free environments. The supply of those eggs is tighter and focused in certain regions, so the effect on prices can be magnified when outbreaks hit cage-free egg farms.",
      "Many of the egg farms with outbreaks were cage-free farms in California. Cage-free egg laws have already gone into effect in California, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan."

    "story": [
      "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time",
      "BEIJING -- Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father\u2019s panicked voice: The brakes don\u2019t work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car\u2019s brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described \u201c free speech absolutist.\u201d Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang\u2019s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It is not common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China\u2019s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla\u2019s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla\u2019s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party \u2014 are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla\u2019s windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\u201cThe government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\u201d said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \u201cThat\u2019s why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\u201d",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang\u2019s mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad\u2019s fault because he hadn\u2019t maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\u201d Zhang said in an interview. \u201cI was burning with anger.\u201d",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \u201cTesla brake failure\u201d in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 200 km (124 miles) from her home. She sat on the Tesla\u2019s roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \u201cTesla Model 3 brakes failed,\u201d she said. \u201cA family of four almost died.\u201d The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \u201cBrakes fail\u201d and headed for Tesla\u2019s booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker\u2019s officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn\u2019t get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \u201cTesla brakes fail!\u201d",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\u201cThings escalated,\u201d said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out, and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang\u2019s protest had been orchestrated -- perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn\u2019t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \u201chad someone behind her\u201d and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive\u2019s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company\u2019s own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang\u2019s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang\u2019s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she\u2019d been asking for, but they\u2019d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn\u2019t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she\u2019d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang\u2019s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world\u2019s most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\u201cI refuse to accept it,\u201d Zhang told the Associated Press, \u201cAs a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\u201d",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it\u2019s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court said that judgments are the result of a \u201cfair trial\u201d based on \u201cthe objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\u201cIt cannot be assumed that the party has received \u2018special protection\u2019 or \u2018special treatment\u2019 because of their victory,\u201d the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it\u2019s generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it\u2019s remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\u201d said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \u201cThe odds are stacked against you. It\u2019s like going to the casino and winning every hand.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China\u2019s premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China\u2019s financial capital.",
      "With Li\u2019s support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla\u2019s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China\u2019s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world\u2019s largest EV-battery maker. China\u2019s BYD is now the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\u201cTesla had a large part to play in that,\u201d said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk\u2019s factory was critical. \u201cIt was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they\u2019re rolling cars off the line,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\u201d",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk\u2019s overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Musk\u2019s \u201cgreater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\u201d said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job of it in China and he\u2019s done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\u201d",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk\u2019s proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla has not publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \u201cmaybe it is time\u201d to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla\u2019s brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\u201cWe were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\u201d a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk\u2019s company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest\u2019s report that claimed Tesla\u2019s Shanghai factory was a \u201csweatshop.\u201d The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla\u2019s ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla is not the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\u201cTesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\u201d said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla\u2019s alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \u201cTesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\u201d",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 30 centimeters (12 inches) of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen\u2019s fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\u201cTesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\u201d Chen said in a court statement reviewed by AP. \u201cI almost lost my life because of the car accident.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:38:29 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump could sign an order as soon as Wednesday to require that U.S. tariffs on imports match the tax rates charged by other countries",

      "President Donald Trump could sign an order as soon as Wednesday to require that U.S. tariffs on imports match the tax rates charged by other countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is taking additional action to upset the world trade system, with plans to sign an order as soon as Wednesday that would require that U.S. tariffs on imports match the tax rates charged by other countries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to be reciprocal,\u201d Trump told reporters earlier this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be hearing that word a lot. Reciprocal. If they charge us, we charge them.\u201d",
      "The president had suggested that the order would come on Tuesday or Wednesday. But when Tuesday passed without the tariffs being officially announced, Trump was asked if he would sign the order on Wednesday and Trump answered: \u201cWe'll see what happens.\u201d On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she believes that the tariffs would come before Thursday's visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "As Trump has unleashed a series of tariffs after being in power for less than a month, he has fully taken ownership of the path of the U.S. economy. It\u2019s a bet that his economic ideas can eventually deliver meaningful results for voters, even if by Trump's own admission the import taxes could involve some financial pain in the form of inflation and economic disruptions. For all of Trump's talk, the impact will likely depend on the details of the tariffs and how other nations respond.",
      "A reciprocal tariffs order could amount to a substantial tax hike to be shouldered largely by U.S. consumers and businesses as the Census Bureau reported that the country had total imports of $4.1 trillion last year. The tariffs could set off retaliatory measures by trading partners that could roil growth around the globe and reset where the United States stands with allies and rivals alike.",
      "By signing the order, Trump would fulfill his long-standing pledge to raise taxes on most imported goods, a clear break with his recent White House predecessors who saw tariffs as either targeted tools to use strategically or barriers worth lowering. Trump has broken with that precedent by saying he wants to return the United States to the 1890s when taxes on imports were the government's dominant source of revenues.",
      "But should job gains never materialize and should inflation stay high, it's an easy line of attack for Democratic lawmakers and candidates that Trump helped the ultrawealthy at the expense of the middle class.",
      "\u201cNo matter which way you slice it, costs are going to climb for consumers,\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said earlier this month. \"I will work with my colleagues to undo this mess, get costs down and get these billionaires out of the way.\u201d",
      "Trump put 10% tariffs on China over its contributions to the production of the illicit drug fentanyl, and China has taken retaliatory measures. He said he is ready if necessary on March 1 \u2014 after a 30-day suspension \u2014 to put tariffs on Mexico and Canada over his belief they should do more to fight illegal immigration and drug smuggling.",
      "On Monday, he closed the exemptions to his 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum, in addition to raising the tariff rates on aluminum. He has also talked about additional taxes on imported autos, computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "Many of America\u2019s dominant trading partners are preparing for an economic rupture in reaction to Trump's possible actions.",
      "In response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday: \u201cUnjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered \u2014 they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures.\u201d That means motorcycles, jeans, bourbon and peanut butter from the United States could face new taxes abroad. Mexico and Canada \u2014 America's two largest trading partners \u2014 have also prepared countermeasures.",
      "Multiple Trump aides have privately said that Trump's long-standing goal with tariffs has been reciprocity. But Trump has also portrayed tariffs as a diplomatic tool to try to force Canada and Mexico to spend more resources on stopping illegal immigration and drug trafficking into the United States. He also suggested repeatedly that tariffs would be a source of revenues that could offset his planned income tax cuts.",
      "But even before Trump formally signed the order, analysts at Goldman Sachs on Tuesday concluded it was unlikely to be the final word on tariffs.",
      "\"Of course, even if President Trump views reciprocal tariffs as an alternative to more sweeping measures at the moment, we are entering only the fourth week of a four-year presidential term and it seems likely there will be many further tariff announcements,\" the investment bank's analysts wrote.",
      "Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a Sunday note that the \u201ctariff trajectory\u201d would shape what happens with growth, inflation, interest rates and Federal Reserve policies this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a major shift from the era of globalization, when companies shrank expenses by pursuing lower-cost labor and materials offshore,\" Zezas said. \"This transition is likely to take many years, creating challenges for some and substantial opportunities for others.\u201d"

      "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected",
      "WASHINGTON -- As a candidate last year, Donald Trump suggested he could easily conquer inflation and ease voters' fears about the economy.",
      "\u201cI will very quickly deflate,\u201d he promised at a California rally. \u201cWe are going to take inflation, and we are going to deflate it. We are going to deflate inflation. We are going to defeat inflation. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of inflation.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's consumer price index report showed that inflation is punching back \u2014 and President Trump could end up facing the same challenges that dragged down his predecessor, President Joe Biden.",
      "The annual inflation rate has risen in the three months since the November election to 3%, with gasoline prices climbing despite Trump's claims that his return to the White House would signal increased oil production that would lower energy costs.",
      "Trump frequently makes far-reaching assertions about his power to bring about change only to find that it is no match for market forces. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that even U.S. presidents are subject to the invisible hand of supply and demand, rather than the masters of it.",
      "Consumer sentiment measures suggest the public already sees Trump\u2019s plans to expand tariffs as increasing inflation. On Wednesday, the president called for interest rate cuts, even though rate hikes by the Federal Reserve helped lower inflation that spiked at a four-decade high in 2022.",
      "The latest consumer price figures have unnerved economists and the financial markets because they suggest that strong consumer spending, solid job gains and a falling unemployment rate could reignite inflation. Steady demand, particularly from wealthier consumers, makes it easier for companies to keep raising prices.",
      "The cost of goods \u2014 including toys and auto parts \u2014 rose last month even before the imposition of tariffs. Trump has placed 10% tariffs on China, in addition to announcing the removal of exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. There are also potential tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico and a potential executive order that would increase tariffs to match the import taxes charged by other countries.",
      "All of this means that baseline inflationary pressures could be at their highest level in decades.",
      "\u201cDisinflation may be dead, and we may be looking at a higher rate of inflation than we observed for the 20 years prior to the pandemic,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a tax and advisory firm.",
      "Trump's call for lower rates puts him in opposition to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.",
      "\u201cIf inflation goes up in general, we will use our tools, which is the interest rate, to bring it back down to 2% over time,\" Powell told a congressional committee on Wednesday. Powell also said that Trump's calls to lower rates wouldn't sway the Fed.",
      "So far, the Trump White House's main response to this challenge has been to blame Biden, an argument with a short lifespan as Trump is exerting more control over economic policy.",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration indeed left us with a mess to deal with,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Wednesday's news briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s far worse than I think anybody anticipated.\u201d",
      "But Trump allies are also starting to float new ideas for tackling inflation. Standing in the Oval Office on Tuesday, billionaire Elon Musk, the head of the president's Department of Government Efficiency, proposed $1 trillion in spending cuts this year.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, wants to eliminate $1 out of every $7 spent by the federal government in order to bring the inflation rate to zero. It's not clear based on lawsuits and Congress' responsibility for government funding that Musk can deliver those savings.",
      "\u201cIf you cut the budget deficit by a trillion between now and next year, there is no inflation,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd if the government is not borrowing as much, it means that interest costs decline. So everyone\u2019s mortgage, their car payment, their credit card bills, anything, their student debt, the monthly payments drop. That\u2019s a fantastic scenario for the average American.\u201d",
      "Such a steep cut might bring lower prices but also the pain of a sharp economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThat would be a roughly 4% of GDP cut to federal spending, all in one year,\u201d said Michael Linden, a senior policy fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cIt would be an instant recession.\u201d",
      "For now, markets are anticipating more inflation as consumer demand stays strong and Trump has yet to show how exactly his policies would keep prices low, as he promised to voters.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped Wednesday to 4.62% in response to the inflation report, a sign that investors expect interest rates, growth and inflation to be higher in the coming months.",
      "Consumers also say that inflation will rise. Americans' expectations of inflation over the next year have soared, according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. The February survey said that inflation this year will be 4.3%, up sharply from 3.3% the previous month. Many respondents mentioned tariffs as a concern.",
      "When asked Wednesday why Trump\u2019s call for lower interest rates would temper inflation, Leavitt focused on what the president \u201cwants\u201d instead of what he would do.",
      "\u201cHe wants interest rates to be lower,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants inflation to be lower. And he believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation.\u201d"

      "In December, more than 70 area residents signed a petition requesting an election to make Starbase its own municipality. Most of the residents are company employees and the community includes over 100 children, according to copies of the petition obtained by The Associated Press.",

      "BANGKOK -- Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand's army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army announced Thursday it is coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates who are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, first is to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",
      "Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media.",

      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",

      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign assistance has dealt a blow to organizations fighting human trafficking and forced labor in Cambodia, where tens of thousands of people are held captive and forced to work in call centers running telephone scams.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people work in remote compounds in countries including Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos where they run online scams targeting people all over the world, including Americans, according to U.N. estimates. Some are trafficked and lured to the jobs under false pretenses and forced to work against their will.",
      "A shelter for people who manage to leave these compounds run by the Catholic charity Caritas recently let some victims go and may stop accepting further victims due to the funding squeeze, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said. The shelter, in the capital Phnom Penh is the only one not operated by the government which takes in victims of scam compounds, both foreign and Cambodian. The sources declined to be named because they were concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration.",
      "The funding freeze has also halted civil-society-assisted rescue work and related programs on preventing human trafficking.",
      "The compounds operate with support from some local elites. Last October, the U.S. sanctioned Ly Yong Phat, a leading member of the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party of Prime Minister Hun Manet, for owning businesses that have trafficked people and forced to work in online scam centers.",
      "The blow to civil society efforts comes as a small network of society and independent media addressing Cambodia\u2019s scam compounds are already under intense government pressure. Independent media outlets have been shuttered, and a prominent Cambodian investigative journalist who had reported on the issue was arrested.",
      "The Trump Administration froze U.S. foreign assistance in January, upending projects all over the world that ranged from providing medications to HIV patients to humanitarian assistance to people displaced by conflict.",
      "While there are other shelters in Cambodia, the one operated by Caritas \u201cis the only qualified and competent shelter,\u201d said Jake Sims, a co-founder of Shamrock, a public-private coalition working to combat transnational organized cybercrime. It offers victims trauma-informed care, as well as help with visas and legal support so they can go back to their home countries.",
      "The Caritas shelter received financial support from Winrock International, USAID\u2019s partner in Cambodia. It was due to receive about $1 million from USAID over the course of two years, the sources said. The shelter was also partially funded by IOM, a United Nations agency which is largely funded by the U.S.",
      "Neither USAID, IOM nor the government of Cambodia responded to requests for comment.",
      "Some people manage to leave the compounds, either making their own escapes \u2014 sometimes jumping out of windows \u2014 or relying on a few rescue operators who assist the Cambodian police. There\u2019s also a Cambodian government rescue hotline.",
      "When victims do get out, they often have trouble returning home. They are usually held in police custody and then sent on to immigration detention where they may linger for months. Many don\u2019t have any savings and may need legal help if they entered the country illegally with smugglers, rescuers say.",
      "Shelters are critical for ensuring victims don\u2019t wind up being trafficked again, said Mina Chiang, founder of Humanity Research Consultancy, which has conducted research on the scam compounds in the region.",
      "\u201cIn 2022, my team and I have learnt cases where Taiwanese survivors became homeless on the streets of Cambodia after escaping the scam compounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have also been cases where survivors were hunted down by criminals after they had escaped.\u201d",
      "Li Ling, a rescue worker who has referred cases to the Caritas shelter, said she has had to stop assisting in rescues of scam workers because of the funding freeze.",
      "Six victims left the shelter as soon as it got a stop-work order, and two of them have subsequently disappeared, said Li, who\u2019s also a PhD student at Ca\u2019Foscari University of Venice studying cyber-enabled modern slavery. She had asked them to stay in regular contact after their departure and said she is concerned they may have wound up back in a scam compound, as they did not have any savings and planned to look for jobs for food and shelter.",
      "Other organizations that support scam center victims have also taken a hit from the funding freeze, such as one which provides medical assistance to victims who injured in escapes, said Li.",
      "For example, last year, they had helped someone who jumped out of a building to escape a scam compound. The organization helped pay for the emergency surgery for the victim, but that source of funds has also stopped.",
      "The funding freeze has also led to the cancellation of other related programs focused on preventing human trafficking.",
      "One non-profit organization registered in the region was due to start a training program with community journalists across Southeast Asia to raise awareness about scam compounds and their recruitment processes. Another labor-focused organization was due to start a training program with labor unions in six Southeast Asian countries on recognizing signs of trafficking, the sources with knowledge of the funding said.",
      "The organizations asked to not be named due to the fear of government retaliation.",
      "Ongoing research funded by to keep track of the latest developments in the scam compounds and the Cambodian government response has also been halted, the source with knowledge of the funding said. Research consultants funded by USAID's counter-trafficking program wrote internal reports for the agency on the criminal activity that are also sometimes shared with Congressional staff, as well as different parts of the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWith U.S. government support now abruptly removed, we can expect an acceleration in civil society repression,\u201d Jake Sims.",
      "Last October, the Cambodian government arrested a well-known investigative journalist who had reported extensively on the proliferation of scam compounds in the country.",
      "After widespread international attention and the support of local media organizations, journalist Mech Dara was released on bail after about a month. Afterward, he made a public statement that he would quit journalism.",
      "Even if new funding is secured, restarting anti-trafficking programs could be more costly, since programs have already been shuttered and contract workers have been let go.",
      "\u201cThe knock-on effect of the USAID funding freeze extends beyond the trafficking and re-trafficking of vulnerable people; it strengthens criminal networks, allowing them to expand their operations,\u201d said Humanity Research Consultancy's Chiang."

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved a proposal from the operator of the congested mid-Atlantic grid to head off the potential for power shortages but that critics say will effectively fast-track the construction of new natural gas plants.",
      "The commission's Tuesday night decision, in a 3-1 vote, said the proposal by PJM Interconnection is \u201cjust and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.\u201d The proposal was originally submitted in December.",
      "PJM, based in Pennsylvania, has said it made the proposal because a power shortage could affect the grid as early as 2026 as demand grows for electricity at the same time coal-fired plants and aging nuclear plants are retiring.",
      "PJM's criteria for an eligible project includes ones that are ready to build, can provide a relatively high power capacity and are likelier to produce electricity when the grid is most likely to see power shortfalls. It said it would open an application period for proposals and select 50 to study.",
      "Clean energy advocates say the process favors gas-fired plants, and they blame PJM for creating the existing reliability problem by taking an unduly long time to study proposed wind and solar energy projects in its project queue.",
      "Proposals awaiting PJM's approval are more than 97% solar, wind or battery storage, according to federal figures. Less than 3% are natural gas.",
      "Some critics questioned PJM's process. The Ohio Consumers' Counsel Office said it will be impossible for consumers to know whether PJM is selecting the most efficient or cost-effective power plants.",
      "Demand for electricity has spiked for the first time in decades, as tech companies competing in the artificial intelligence race pursue new power supplies for energy-hungry data centers.",

    "summary": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the latest U.S. government agency to have its work halted by the Trump administration",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is the latest U.S. government agency to have its work halted by the Trump administration",
      "NEW YORK -- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Congress established to monitor credit card companies, mortgage providers, debt collectors and other segments of the consumer finance industry, is the latest U.S. government agency to have its work halted by the Trump administration.",
      "Conservatives have long targeted the work of the CFPB. Critics complain the independent agency, funded by the Federal Reserve System, lacks sufficient supervision and regularly exceeds its regulatory authority. Defenders argue the bureau's watchdog mission has strong bipartisan support.",
      "Here's some background on the scope of the CFPB's activities and how the agency's tenuous status might affect consumers:",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is charged with creating rules and taking enforcement actions to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices by a wide range of financial institutions and businesses. Its actions involve banks, mortgage servicers, credit card companies, student loan processors, payday lenders, money transfer providers, credit reporting agencies and debt collectors.",
      "During the Biden administration, the CFPB passed rules capping bank overdraft fees and removing medical debt from credit reports. The bureau sued financial services companies for misleading consumers and employers for misleading workers. It also focused on curbing junk fees and predatory lending practices.",
      "Congress established the agency as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The legislation was intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. The CFPB says it has obtained nearly $20 billion for consumers since then in the form of monetary compensation, canceled debts, reduced loans and other financial relief.",
      "Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, told the CFPB last weekend to stop its investigations and work on proposed rules. He instructed the agency to suspend the enforcement dates of any rules that had been finalized but not yet put into effect, and closed the CFPB's offices for a week.",
      "Vought sent an email to employees on Monday morning saying they should \u201cnot perform any work tasks.\u201d They were directed to contact the top lawyer for the Office of Management and Budget \u201cto get approval in writing\u201d before doing anything.",
      "Vought also said in a social media post that the agency would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, which Congress assigned as the CFPB's funding source to avoid the political wrangling of the congressional appropriations process.",
      "Two top officials resigned Tuesday in protest. Also Tuesday, Trump named Jonathan McKernan, a former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board member, as the agency's new director.",
      "Before Trump took office, banks and industry groups sometimes sued to block some of the agency\u2019s rules.",
      "For example, when the CFPB issued a rule in 2017 to limit the number of payments the providers of payday loans, vehicle title loans, and high-cost installment loans could take from customer bank accounts, trade associations for payday lenders challenged the bureau's Federal Reserve funding as unconstitutional. In May 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected their argument and upheld the CFPB's funding and oversight model.",
      "Trump on Monday defended his administration\u2019s efforts to reform the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying the agency was \u201cset up to destroy people.\u201d",
      "The overdraft fee rule was finalized and set to take effect in October, but Vought\u2019s directive puts it on hold. Banks had previously sued to get the rule thrown out.",
      "The rule would require the largest banks to pick one of three options: to reduce overdraft fees to $5, to reduce them to a rate that reflects how much an overdraft costs them, or to disclose, along with the fee, the fee\u2019s Annual Percent Rate (APR) as they do with other short-term loans. Overdraft fees currently run about $35 on average.",
      "The CFPB finalized a rule in January that would remove medical debt from credit reports. The agency had said the change could potentially improve the credit scores of millions of people and make it easier for them to get mortgages and other loans. The rule was set to take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register but is now suspended. It also was the subject of a legal challenge.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on lowering prices, and a lot of people voted for him because of high prices. and yet we\u2019re seeing Republicans move to make them pay high overdraft fees and pay more for loans on their credit,\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cThe public broadly thinks that overdraft fees are unfair and medical debt shouldn\u2019t be on credit reports. If you ask ordinary people, these are not partisan issues.\u201d",
      "Lindsey Johnson, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, characterized the CFPB\u2019s work under Biden as \u201caggressive.\u201d She said the agency took action in recent years without going through the appropriate procedures.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe they had the proper oversight,\u201d she said.",
      "Miranda Margowsky, a spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association, an industry group that counts many financial technology companies as members, said her organization anticipates and hopes several CFPB rules, including those governing \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans and other fintech products, will be reversed \u201cwith the stroke of a pen.\u201d",
      "She characterized the rules as \u201coverly broad, overreaching, and harmful.\u201d",
      "Supporters of the CFPB protested outside the bureau's shuttered Washington headquarters this week. NAACP President Derrick Johnson and others have demanded the office's reopening.",
      "\u201cThe CFPB has provided crucial protections against big banks and lenders,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cWithout this critical oversight, consumers \u2014 especially Black and Brown communities \u2014 will be vulnerable to fraud, predatory lending, and discriminatory financial practices.\u201d",
      "Kitty Richards, senior strategic advisor at the advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative, said consumers today are more vulnerable to data privacy violations, junk fees, and financial scams. Without the CFPB, corporations are \u201cfreer to prey on the American people without fearing they might have to give back the money,\" she said.",

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has declined to immediately hear a case that seeks to restore collective bargaining rights lost that tens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other public workers lost in 2011",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined on Wednesday to hear a case that seeks to restore collective bargaining rights lost in 2011 to tens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other public workers.",
      "The court's decision means the case must first go through a lower appeals court before it will likely end up before the state Supreme Court.",
      "Seven unions representing teachers and other public workers in Wisconsin filed the lawsuit seeking to overturn the anti-union 2011 law, known as Act 10. The law had withstood numerous legal challenges before a Dane County circuit court judge in December found the bulk of it to be unconstitutional, setting up the appeal to the state Supreme Court.",
      "The Act 10 law effectively ended collective bargaining for most public unions by allowing them to bargain solely over base wage increases no greater than inflation. It also disallowed the automatic withdrawal of union dues, required annual recertification votes for unions, and forced public workers to pay more for health insurance and retirement benefits.",
      "Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost in December ruled that the law violates equal protection guarantees in the Wisconsin Constitution by dividing public employees into \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d employees. Under the ruling, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power would have it restored to what was in place before 2011.",
      "The judge put the ruling on hold pending the appeal.",
      "The law\u2019s introduction in 2011 spurred massive protests that stretched on for weeks. It made Wisconsin the center of a national fight over union rights, catapulted then-Gov. Scott Walker onto the national stage, sparked an unsuccessful recall campaign and laid the groundwork for Walker\u2019s failed 2016 presidential bid.",
      "The law\u2019s adoption led to a dramatic decrease in union membership across the state. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum said in a 2022 analysis that since 2000, Wisconsin had the largest decline in the proportion of its workforce that is unionized.",
      "In 2015, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature approved a right-to-work law that limited the power of private-sector unions.",
      "If the lawsuit is successful, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power will have it restored. They would be treated the same as the police, firefighter and other public safety unions who remain exempt.",
      "Supporters of the law have said it gave local governments more control over workers and the powers they needed to cut costs. Repealing the law, which allowed schools and local governments to raise money through higher employee contributions for benefits, would bankrupt those entities, backers of Act 10 have argued.",
      "Democratic opponents argue that the law has hurt schools and other government agencies by taking away the ability of employees to collectively bargain for their pay and working conditions.",
      "Public sector unions that brought the lawsuit are the Abbotsford Education Association; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Locals 47 and 1215; the Beaver Dam Education Association; SEIU Wisconsin; the Teaching Assistants\u2019 Association Local 3220 and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 695."

      "Olympian and 1977 Boston Marathon champion Jerome Drayton has died at the age of 80",
      "TORONTO -- Jerome Drayton, who finished sixth at the Montreal Olympics, won the 1977 Boston Marathon and held the Canadian men\u2019s marathon record for 43 years, has died. He was 80.",
      "Drayton died unexpectedly on Monday in Toronto, according to Cardinal Funeral Homes. Runners World magazine said he died during knee surgery.",
      "Born in Germany with the name Peter Buniak, Drayton changed his name after immigrating to Canada in 1956. He won Detroit's Motor City Marathon in 1969 in a North American record time of 2 hours, 12 minutes, and shaved 47 seconds off the mark in winning the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan later that year.",
      "He won the 1973 Canadian championship before finishing third in Boston in 1974. Three years later \u2014 his fifth try in Boston \u2014 he pulled ahead when eventual four-time winner Bill Rodgers began to tire in the 77-degree heat and gave Canada its first victory in the race in three decades. Drayton finished second at the New York Marathon that fall.",
      "\u201cJerome remains the most recent Open Division Men\u2019s Champion from Canada, and set the stage for generations of world class Canadian marathoners to follow in his footsteps,\u201d Boston Athletic Association President Jack Fleming said.",
      "Drayton also set a world record on the track for the 10-mile run in 1970 in 46:37.6, and was the top Canadian in the men's marathon at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. The Canada Sports Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 1978, said that Drayton held 12 national titles and set 13 records in his career.",
      "After retiring, Drayton worked as a consultant with the Sports and Fitness Division of Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Youth, Culture and Recreation.",
      "\u201cHe was a runner who cared not only about his own performance but the growth and development of the sport,\" Fleming said. \u201cThe feedback and interest he showed in the Boston Marathon undoubtedly helped shape the marathon in the late 70s and beyond.\u201d"

      "The New York Jets announced Thursday they told quarterback Aaron Rodgers they are moving on without him next season.",
      "While Rodgers hasn\u2019t said whether he intends to continue playing for a 21st NFL season, the Jets \u2014 with new general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn in charge \u2014 have officially ruled out a return to New York.",
      "In a joint statement issued by the team, Mougey and Glenn said they met with the 41-year-old quarterback last week and informed him of their plans.",
      "\u201cIt was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures,\" Mougey and Glenn said in the statement. \"We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward.\u201d",
      "The four-time MVP, who\u2019s the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season, has one year of non-guaranteed money left on his contract with the Jets.",
      "New York would absorb a $49 million dead money charge next season unless it designates Rodgers a post-June 1 cut and can spread out that charge over two years.",
      "In April 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets after 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers \u2014 looking to help the franchise end a Super Bowl drought which dates to the glory days of Joe Namath and the 1968 season.",
      "Rodgers\u2019 first season in New York ended just four snaps into his debut because of a torn left Achilles tendon that sank the Jets\u2019 Super Bowl hopes that were stirred by the QB\u2019s arrival.",
      "He worked his way back to the field to start every game this past season, but he and the offense struggled with consistency and results and the Jets finished 5-12.",
      "\u201cI personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets,\u201d owner Woody Johnson in a statement. \u201cHis arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From Day 1, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here.",
      "\"He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next.\u201d",
      "Rodgers\u2019 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing both rank third for a single season in franchise history. But he lacked some mobility early in his return and then dealt with a few additional leg injuries, including a significant hamstring ailment.",
      "The Jets\u2019 offense with Rodgers struggled to produce, the defense was a shell of its formerly dominant self and it cost both general manager Joe Douglas and coach Robert Saleh their jobs in the middle of the season.",
      "In what turned out to be his final appearance with New York, Rodgers threw a season-high four touchdown passes in a win over Miami on Jan. 5.",
      "It was a vintage performance \u2014 and a somewhat frustrating flash to fans of how things could have gone for Rodgers and the Jets.",

      "About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk-contest days were done",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk contest days were done. He'd been in the contest at the NBA's All-Star weekend twice, won it both times with plenty of flair and figured there was nothing else to prove.",
      "Then a week later, he found himself practicing new dunks. And that's when he quickly realized that he has one \u2014 and he insists, only one \u2014 dunk contest left in him.",
      "\u201cI love the contest, man,\" McClung said. \u201cIt'd be an action in fear not to do it again. So, I'll do it \u2014 one last time.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-2 McClung \u2014 a standout guard in the G League who has appeared in only five NBA games \u2014 is headed back to All-Star weekend, looking to become the first person to win the league's dunk title in three consecutive years. Nate Robinson is the only three-time dunk champion, though his didn't come in back-to-back-to-back years.",
      "McClung breathed new life into the dunk contest and got rave reviews from some of the NBA's biggest names when he first won it in 2023, then went airborne over Shaquille O'Neal to win it again last year. Now he goes for three in a row in San Francisco on Saturday night, with San Antonio rookie Stephon Castle, Chicago rookie Matas Buzelis and Milwaukee second-year wing Andre Jackson Jr. providing the competition.",
      "\u201cI'm not going there to lose,\u201d Buzelis said.",
      "Added Jackson: \u201cI just want to be myself and put on a show.\u201d",
      "Castle is confident as well, though acknowledged he expects to feel some nerves on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI get nervous for most games,\u201d Castle said. \u201cI think it's just going to be another event for me.\u201d",
      "When this weekend is over, they'll all head back to their NBA jobs. McClung, for now, continues to wait for a real opportunity.",
      "His five NBA games have come with four NBA teams \u2014 one with Chicago, one with the Los Angeles Lakers, two with Philadelphia and one with Orlando. He's scored 33 points in those games, 20 coming in one contest with the 76ers at Brooklyn on April 9, 2023.",
      "He hasn't scored an NBA point since that day.",
      "\u201cThe easy answer is opportunity,\" McClung said. \u201cIt's not just Mac McClung. There's a lot of G League guys that can play in the league. There\u2019s a lot of guys I\u2019ve seen in the G League and then they get an opportunity in the (NBA) and people are like, \u2018Man, he got so much better this last year.' And I'm like, \u2018No, he\u2019s been good.' I really have my faith in God, and believe I\u2019m always right where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d",
      "For now, that's with the Osceola Magic. He's on a two-way contract with Orlando, and McClung is averaging 24.5 points and 6.1 assists during this G League regular season. He's been rookie of the year, he's been a G League champion and this season he's the reigning G League MVP.",
      "\u201cI take pride in the G League,\u201d McClung said. \u201cEach year it's so hard because when you're on a two-way people are like \u2018Be ready, stay ready.\u2019 But I'm trying to win in the G League. That's important to me. Winning a championship is always the standard and hopefully we can do that this year in Osceola and apply even more pressure.\u201d",
      "Winning back-to-back dunk contests has brought a ton of notoriety. People recognize McClung more now, but he hasn't changed. He's comfortable in jeans and T-shirts, drives a Ford Bronco, has the same group of friends that will smack him back in line if he gets out of line. He's proud to be the small-town kid from Gate City, Virginia \u2014 who just happens to be able to jump higher than most people and has become one of the most famous dunkers in the world.",
      "He's been offered chances to play in Europe for bigger money than he's making in the G League, too. But the dream remains the NBA, and McClung isn't ready to give up on it. He's always been the underdog and typically has found a way to turn his hopes into reality.",
      "\u201cIt's funny. I don\u2019t even look at myself as a dunker,\" McClung said. \u201cThe people that know me best know I'm a competitor first. Obviously, I haven\u2019t made an impact in the league yet or anything like that, but that\u2019s who I want to be and where I want to be. That\u2019s truly where my heart is.\u201d",
      "He'll be back on the NBA stage on Saturday, with a shot at dunking his way into history.",

      "New Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Spencer Horwitz is expected to miss most of spring training after undergoing surgery on his right wrist",
      "BRADENTON, Fla. -- Newly acquired Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Spencer Horwitz is expected to miss most of spring training after undergoing surgery on his right wrist.",
      "Horwitz, acquired in a trade with Cleveland in December, will be out at least 6-8 weeks, though Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said Tuesday the team is not putting an exact timetable on a possible return.",
      "The 27-year-old Horwitz hit .265 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs in 97 games with Toronto last season. The Blue Jays shipped him to Cleveland in December and hours later the Guardians sent him to Pittsburgh in exchange for pitcher Luis Ortiz and two prospects.",
      "Horwitz had been dealing with what the Pirates called a \u201cchronic\u201d wrist problem. Cherington said the team was aware of the issue at the time of the trade but Horwitz began to experience \u201cnew symptoms\u201d in late January, which led to the decision to have surgery.",
      "The Pirates have multiple internal options to fill first base while Horwitz rehabs, including utility infielder Jared Triolo and Darick Hall, who split time between first base and designated hitter with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2022 and 2023. Hall hit 16 home runs in Triple-A last season.",
      "While outfielder Bryan Reynolds took ground balls at first base during practice late in the 2024 season, Cherington said the team is focused on keeping Reynolds in the outfield. Endy Rodriguez, who hasn't played in the majors since undergoing elbow surgery in the fall of 2023, is expected to remain at catcher for now.",

      "SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria -- Finishing fourth when medals are on the line can feel like cruel punishment.",
      "Paula Moltzan knows the feeling all too well.",
      "Already at this year's Alpine skiing world championships, she was on the U.S. squad that finished fourth in the mixed team parallel event. Then she couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead that partner Lauren Macuga had set up in the downhill portion of the new team combined event and ended up fourth with her slalom run.",
      "Also on the U.S. team that finished fourth in the team parallel at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, Moltzan\u2019s only major medal had been a victory with the U.S. team in the same event at the last worlds two years ago.",
      "Until Thursday, when Moltzan took the bronze medal in giant slalom for her first individual medal at this level, finishing a mere hundredth of a second ahead of Thea Louise Stjernesund of Norway \u2014 in a race won by Federica Brignone of Italy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s feeling pretty special right now,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cSki racing big time comes down to the hundredths of a second. And so to be on the right side on a big stage feels pretty amazing. And to share it with my family and my husband and my whole team is unmatched.\u201d",
      "Moltzan was third in the opening run held in bright sunshine and then maintained her position in fading light during the second run. Knowing immediately that she had earned a medal, the Minnesota native pumped her arms up and down, threw her hands on top of her helmet in apparent disbelief and waved to her cheering squad in the stands decked out in USA hockey jerseys with Moltzan\u2019s name on the back.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my mom and my dad and my mother-in-law, my father-in-law. And then our two really good friends from Vermont and then my agent,\u201d Moltzan said.",
      "Of course, there was one other special person enjoying the medal, too: Husband Ryan Mooney, who is Moltzan\u2019s ski technician and unofficial coach, eventually skied down from the start and took part in the post-race podium celebration.",
      "Long regarded as the U.S. women\u2019s team\u2019s second-best technical skier behind Mikaela Shiffrin, Moltzan\u2019s medal came in a race that Shiffrin sat out as defending champion while still recovering her giant slalom form and mental state following a crash in November.",
      "Moltzan also finished third in the final World Cup giant slalom before the worlds. She had a string of solid results entering the last worlds, too, only to break her hand again while helping the Americans win the team event \u2014 which led to a DNF (did not finish) in giant slalom and forced her to sit out the slalom, which has traditionally been her best event.",
      "Moltzan won gold in slalom at the junior worlds a decade ago but then lost her spot on the U.S. team a year later because of poor results.",
      "So she enrolled at the University of Vermont and won the NCAA slalom title a year later. While still at UVM in 2018, she finished 17th in the World Cup slalom down the road at Killington, giving her enough World Cup points to head back over to Europe and resume World Cup racing.",
      "Only she still wasn\u2019t part of the U.S. team, meaning that she and then-boyfriend Mooney had to raise $50,000 on their own to travel and compete across the Alps.",
      "\u201cI definitely have an unconventional story,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cBut I\u2019m proud of every step of it and it feels good to add this to the list of accomplishments I have.\u201d",
      "Both of Moltzan\u2019s parents were ski instructors at Buck Hill in Minnesota and Moltzan moved into the elite program led there by Lindsey Vonn\u2019s former coach, Erich Sailer, when she was 12.",
      "Now she\u2019s established herself as a contender for a medal at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics, with Vonn also planning to compete at the age of 41.",
      "Moltzan became the fourth American woman to earn a medal at this year's worlds, after Macuga\u2019s bronze in the super-G, Breezy Johnson\u2019s downhill victory and gold for Johnson and Shiffrin in team combined.",
      "\u201cThe women\u2019s U.S. Ski Team right now is extremely strong in both tech and speed, and it feels like everything is just kind of working off each other,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cYou watch the speed girls compete and their passion and their speed and you just feel like, \u2019OK, well, I don\u2019t want to be the athlete or the team that doesn\u2019t medal today.' And obviously we\u2019re missing Mikaela Shiffrin here. But I think even without her, we are a very strong team in GS.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun to be a part of a team,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that experience in a world championships or Olympics before. I\u2019ve always loved the combined as an individual (event). They don\u2019t have that anymore. So this is my next best option. I get along great with every single member of my team and I would be proud to race with anyone.\u201d",
      "But at the worlds, Vonn was very public about her desire to race with Shiffrin, who ended up winning gold with Breezy Johnson. Vonn and AJ Hurt placed 16th on Tuesday.",
      "The new event entails one racer competing in a downhill run and another in a slalom run, with their times added together to determine the final results.",
      "Shiffrin and Vonn are the winningest female racers in World Cup history with 99 victories for Shiffrin and 82 for Vonn. Vonn is the all-time leader in World Cup downhill victories with 43 and Shiffrin holds the mark in slalom with 62 \u2014 both records among men and women.",
      "\u201cWould it have been a really cool thing to have 181 wins in one team? I think it would have been,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s best for the team, it\u2019s not me right now. That doesn\u2019t mean that next year things might change.\u201d",
      "Vonn struggled in her downhill run of the combined, finishing 21st and a distant 2.51 seconds behind the leader, American teammate Lauren Macuga. Johnson was fourth, setting up her gold medal with Shiffrin.",
      "That performance by Vonn followed a hooked gate that took her out of the super-G and a 15th-place finish in the downhill.",
      "\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m skiing better than I was before, but from the gliding (standpoint) I am not fast,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never had a problem with. And I just need to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Having recently returned to ski racing with a new titanium knee after nearly six years of retirement, Vonn is playing catch up with her new equipment.",
      "Vonn\u2019s longtime ski technician, Heinz Haemmerle, retired, so equipment supplier Head assigned her Chris Krause, who formerly worked for Didier Cuche and Bode Miller. But then Krause got sick, so she was assigned yet another technician, Rene Meusburger.",
      "Is Vonn trying to convince Haemmerle to follow her out of retirement?",
      "\u201cI think that would be unfair to Heinz. He had a bad accident a few months ago with his leg and he hasn\u2019t skied yet. He\u2019s got a giant scar bigger than mine,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely going to help me. To what degree? I don\u2019t know. But I also want to be fair to him and I don\u2019t want to put him a position where he\u2019s risking his health to help me.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got an amazing position now with Rene. He\u2019s super young and he gets along well with Heinz. I think having the old and the young (techs) together would be a cool and a beneficial partnership. But it\u2019s not all sorted out yet.\u201d",
      "Whoever is tuning her skis will be just as busy after this season ends, when Vonn will embark on a marathon testing session to get her setup up to speed \u2014 likely on European glaciers before moving to South America or New Zealand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be full throttle spring and summer to really get things going,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be a matter of getting good enough snow conditions to do that.\u201d",
      "After leaving the worlds, Vonn flew to Switzerland for a teaching arrangement at the Aiglon ski academy. Then she was heading home to Miami.",

      "The U.S. Education Department is scrapping a policy from the Biden administration that threatened to upend colleges\u2019 plans to pay athletes for their name, image and likeness by making those payments subject to federal Title IX rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Education Department is scrapping last-minute guidance issued by the Biden administration that threatened to upend colleges\u2019 plans to pay athletes for their name, image and likeness by making those payments subject to federal Title IX rules.",
      "In a move that was largely expected, President Donald Trump\u2019s education officials announced the change Wednesday, saying the memo from former President Joe Biden\u2019s final days in office had no legal basis under Title IX, the 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination in education.",
      "\u201cThe NIL guidance, rammed through by the Biden Administration in its final days, is overly burdensome, profoundly unfair and it goes well beyond what agency guidance is intended to achieve,\u201d said Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights.",
      "A Jan. 16 memo from the Biden administration told universities that NIL payments must be treated the same as athletic financial aid such as scholarships. It sent athletic departments across the country back to the drawing board.",
      "Football and men's basketball players were expected to receive the bulk of the $20.5 million that athletic departments will be allowed to distribute starting next school year. Universities had to figure out whether they needed to change plans to avoid running afoul of the Biden policy, which said NIL payments \u201cmust be made proportionately available to male and female athletes.\u201d",
      "Passed in 1972, Title IX requires that schools pay out financial assistance in proportion to the number of students of each gender who play sports on campus. It also calls for schools to provide opportunities to play varsity sports in proportion to the gender distribution on campus.",
      "Attorneys differed on whether the Biden memo placed the scheduled April 7 approval of the House settlement, which dictates the financial boundaries for the NIL payments, in jeopardy.",
      "Trump\u2019s education officials said such a sweeping change would require \u201cclear legal authority\u201d that does not exist.",
      "\u201cEnacted over 50 years ago, Title IX says nothing about how revenue-generating athletics programs should allocate compensation among student athletes,\u201d Trainor said.",
      "It's the second time in eight days the Trump administration has used Title IX to advance its priorities. Last week's executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in girls and women's sports was also a Title IX move. It gives federal agencies the ability to ensure schools that receive federal funding abide by the administration's views on the law.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Algeria boxer Imane Khelif, who found herself in the middle of a bitter divide about gender in sports during the Paris Olympics, has denounced \u201cfalse and offensive\u201d accusations from the International Boxing Association.",
      "\u201cI have been knocked down more times than I can count. But I have never stayed down,\u201d Khelif said late Tuesday on her Instagram account.",
      "The IBA said this week it will file criminal complaints against the International Olympic Committee in the U.S., France and Switzerland. The Swiss-based IOC allowing female boxers Khelif and Lin Yu-ting to compete and win gold medals in Paris last year \u201cmay serve as grounds for criminal prosecution,\u201d the IBA claimed.",
      "Khelif responded by saying she \u201cwill take all necessary legal steps to ensure that my rights and the principles of fair competition are upheld.\"",
      "\"Those responsible of these actions must be held accountable, and we will pursue all available legal avenues to ensure that justice prevails,\" she added.",
      "The Russian-led IBA has been banished from the Olympics but it cited an executive order on transgender athletes by United States President Donald Trump to justify the criminal complaints.",
      "Khelif said the IBA has \u201cagain made baseless accusations that are false and offensive, using them to further their agenda. This is a matter that concerns not just me but the broader principles of fairness and due process in sport.\u201d",

      "Khelif advanced through the Olympic Games amid international scrutiny and uninformed speculation about her sex. Despite being born and raised as a woman, she found herself at the center of Western debates about gender, sex and sports after failing unspecified eligibility tests for women\u2019s competition from the IBA in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have seen adversity before,\u201d Khelif said. \u201cI have fought through every setback, every false accusation, every attempt to erase me. And I have won. Each obstacle has only strengthened my resolve. I will continue to compete with honor and integrity.\u201d",

      "Pitchers and catchers begin on-field work for most clubs in Arizona and Florida, though the Cubs got going Sunday and the Dodgers started Tuesday",
      "There's a new No. 2 in the New York Yankees' rotation behind Gerrit Cole. A familiar face is getting a fresh start leading the Cincinnati Reds. Meanwhile, Shohei Ohtani and Co. already have their title defense underway.",
      "There's plenty to see as baseball returns Wednesday for most MLB clubs, with pitchers and catchers officially reporting at sites across Arizona and Florida. The Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers got an early spring training start ahead of their season-opening series in Tokyo, and a few clubs don't get going until Thursday. But for most, Wednesday marks the start of a new season.",
      "That includes the Yankees, who are welcoming back Cole, the 2023 Cy Young Award winner, after he chose to remain with the Yankees rather than opt out of his contract. He'll be joined in the rotation by Max Fried, a key addition as they try to return to the World Series.",
      "New York lost to the Dodgers in five games, failed to bring back Juan Soto in free agency, then signed Fried to a $218 million, eight-year contract, the largest ever for a left-handed pitcher. Fried went 54-25 with a 2.81 ERA over the past five seasons with the Braves and was instrumental in Atlanta's 2021 World Series victory over the Astros.",
      "Wednesday will also be Day 1 for new Cincinnati Reds manager Terry Francona. Cincinnati went 77-85 last season but has some promising young talent, led by young ace Hunter Greene. Francona won two World Series titles with the Red Sox and took Cleveland to the playoffs six times in 11 years. That includes the 2016 World Series.",
      "Los Angeles added even more star power this winter with two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell and Japanese phenom pitcher Roki Sasaki. The rotation got another apparent boost Tuesday when Clayton Kershaw showed up for camp. It's been expected the 36-year-old would re-join the Dodgers for an 18th season, but he remained a free agent entering camp.",
      "Of course, the biggest boost to LA's rotation will be Shohei Ohtani's return from elbow surgery that kept him off the mound in 2024. He may provide an update to media Wednesday on his timeline to return.",

      "The families of Parker Tirrell, 15, and Iris Turmelle, 14, sued in August, seeking to overturn the Fairness in Women\u2019s Sports Act that former Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed into law in July.",

      "A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\u201d could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\" could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500, and, should the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner use the provisional, it would make for the largest field in a decade.",
      "It's a complicated rule that was written into the charter agreement that 13 teams signed last September and is similar to a \u201cpromoters provisional\u201d in that it gives NASCAR the ability to designate one driver as a guaranteed 41st entry.",
      "Three-time Daytona 500 Denny Hamlin said the rule \u201creeks of desperation\u201d by NASCAR, calling it nothing but a gimmick to attract big stars to stock car racing. Others wondered why the provisional went to Castroneves, who at 49 will be making his NASCAR debut, instead of seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, a two-time Daytona 500 winner.",
      "The rule is designed for drivers who don't currently race full time in NASCAR, so Johnson and 2017 Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. would have been eligible for consideration for the provisional.",
      "But their teams never put in the request, which must be done 90 days before the event. Only Trackhouse Racing requested the provisional for Castroneves, who enters Wednesday's qualifying as the only driver eligible for the 41st spot.",
      "\u201cI think Jimmie Johnson is a world-class driver, but I guess other people don\u2019t,\u201d Alex Bowman said. \"It\u2019s an interesting rule for sure. There\u2019s a lot of hype and importance to the sport to have people like (Castroneves) that come in and, if they miss the race, it kind of hurts the whole thing.",
      "\"So I get it, but I also wish some of our past champions were respected in the same way in some sense.\u201d",
      "Castroneves will use the provisional only if he fails in traditional qualifying to claim one of the four open spots in what was supposed to be a 40-car field. If he uses it, the 41 cars will be the most in the Daytona 500 since 2015, when 43 cars was still standard.",
      "Trackhouse and Castroneves also won't receive any points or payouts if he's the 41st driver, and all drivers who finish behind him will be moved up one position in the standings.",
      "The rule has divided the field, even though it probably will come into play only at Daytona International Speedway, where nine drivers are vying for the four open spots. NASCAR's charter system guarantees entry to 36 cars every race.",
      "\u201cAside from the Daytona 500, we don\u2019t get in a spot very often where drivers of that caliber are going home,\" Tyler Reddick said. \"I don\u2019t know where to fall on this. On one hand, I would hate for a guy like Lewis Hamilton to come over here and attempt to start the 500... (and) something keeps him from running the race. We also don\u2019t just want to let them have a spot in the race \u2014 like, they have to earn it.\u201d",
      "Logically, if multiple drivers had requested the provisional, the most sense would have been for it to go to the highest qualifier.",
      "Nope.",

The criteria listed in the charter for the rule states \"the \u201cOpen Exemption\u201d position is intended for a driver who will significantly impact the promotion of the event and grow the prominence of the sport.",
      "In a competition briefing held for media last month, a hypothetical scenario was posed about what NASCAR would do if seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton, four-time F1 champion Max Verstappen, six-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and Johnson, who is also a NASCAR Hall of Famer, all put in a request for the same race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to have that problem,\u201d said John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president of racing development.",
      "NASCAR could have that problem later this year when it goes to Mexico City, where several teams are exploring deals to enter Juan Pablo Montoya in the race, and who knows who could show up at a road course \u2014 Shane van Gisbergen was brought into the inaugural street race at Chicago, won it and by the end of the year had left his Australian V8 Supercars career behind for NASCAR.",
      "At Indianapolis in 2023, former F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kamui Kobayashi were both in the field, while Button was part of the same field as Kimi Raikkonen to make it two F1 world champions in the 2023 race at Circuit of the Americas.",
      "\u201cI can argue both sides of the fence. You\u2019d hate to have a Helio Castroneves, a Max Verstappen, a Lewis Hamilton or someone come in to run a race and then miss the show due to something silly,\u201d Chase Elliott said. \"So I can certainly see that aspect of it from a promoter. But I also think that with prestigious races, there should be some sort of integrity in making the show.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s part of what makes the race prestigious. You know, it\u2019s a hard event to make. I think you see that with the Indianapolis 500, or you see that at the Chili Bowl, right? It\u2019s a hard race to make. It\u2019s a big deal just to get into the show. I just don\u2019t want to ever degrade or hurt the long-term integrity of the sport and take the prestige out of events that should be some of our biggest days of the year.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "Saquon Barkley rushed for 31 yards in the first half of Philadelphia's Super Bowl win and set the NFL season rushing record, postseason included, topping the mark of 2,476 yards set by Terrell Davis",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Saquon Barkley set an NFL single-season rushing record in the Super Bowl, held his young daughter as a torrent of confetti fluttered around them and flashed a smile as he held a Philadelphia newspaper with \u201cCHAMPS!\u201d stamped above his photo.",
      "The Eagles running back then grasped what he really wanted to kiss and hold on this night in the Superdome \u2014 what he could only hope was ahead following his tumultuous end in New York that diverted his career down the turnpike to Philadelphia.",
      "The 2,000-yard rusher earned his turn with the Lombardi Trophy.",
      "\u201cShe looked prettier in person, I\u2019ll tell you that,\" Barkley said. \u201cSomething that you dream of. I\u2019m just happy to hold it, be able to give it a kiss.\u201d",
      "Barkley finished with a modest 57 yards rushing in Eagles' 40-22 win over Kansas City in the Super Bowl \u2014 a paltry number for an elite back who posted seven touchdown runs of 60-plus yards this season \u2014 but the total was enough to set the NFL single-season rushing record, postseason included, topping the mark of 2,476 yards set by Terrell Davis.",
      "He ended perhaps the greatest debut season of any free agent in Philadelphia sports history on perhaps the greatest championship team the city has ever seen with 2,504 total yards rushing and 18 rushing touchdowns.",
      "\u201cHell of a year, right? I couldn\u2019t do it without the big boys up front, everyone on this team. I just appreciate them \u2013 the whole Eagles organization,\" Barkley said. \"Of me being a newcomer, welcoming me in with open arms and helping build confidence back in me too. That was definitely helpful.",
      "\"It was a hell of a year, but all of the numbers and stats or records are cool, but the best thing is to be able to hold that Lombardi Trophy.\u201d",
      "Barkley, the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year, needed only 30 yards to top Davis' total set in 1998 when he helped the Denver Broncos win the Super Bowl. Also that season, Davis was the last running back to win Super Bowl MVP.",
      "Barkley ran the ball on the first offensive play of the Super Bowl and finally got the mark after a slow first half on a 2-yard run on the last play of the half. Barkley had 12 carries for 31 yards for a measly 2.6 yards per carry. He averaged 5.8 yards in the regular season.",
      "The Eagles were fine without Barkley\u2019s usually spectacular production. Thanks to two interceptions by the defense and two total touchdowns from Jalen Hurts, the Eagles led the Chiefs 24-0 at halftime.",
      "Barkley had reason to feel festive Sunday, not only setting the record and playing in his first Super Bowl in his first season with the Eagles, he also turned 28.",
      "His 2,005 yards rushing in the regular season made Barkley the ninth running back in NFL history to top 2,000 yards and he entered the Super Bowl with 2,447 total rushing yards.",
      "Barkley's seven touchdowns of 60-plus yards (that includes the postseason) were a record and he joined Davis as one of only two players in NFL history with at least 400 yards rushing and five touchdowns in a single postseason.",
      "Long reluctant to spend major money on running backs, the Eagles have reaped the rewards and a rewriting of the franchise record book on their $26 million guaranteed leap of faith on Barkley. He has flashed the kind of did-you-see-that plays that fans say are ripped straight from a video game; including a mind-bending backward hurdle that was so foreign to the sport Madden had to release an update to make it possible in its game.",
      "There was nothing virtual about this Lombardi Trophy.",
      "\u201cIt's better in person than it is in Madden, I\u2019ll tell you that playing as a kid,\u201d Barkley said. \"It\u2019s everything you dream of. I\u2019m just happy to be able to hold it, give it a kiss and be world champs.\u201d",
      "All this after his departure in free agency was chronicled by the documentary series \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d",
      "In the crucial scene, Giants general manager Joe Schoen told Barkley New York would not make him an offer or stick the franchise tag on him. Rather, the Giants let Barkley test the free-agent market, a move that sent him to an NFC East rival.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll have a tough time sleeping if Saquon goes to Philadelphia, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d team owner John Mara said to Schoen in the series. \u201cAs I\u2019ve told you, just being around enough players, he\u2019s the most popular player we have, by far.\u201d",
      "Mara might have a tough night getting winks after this Super Bowl.",
      "Stuck at just two career playoff games in six seasons with the Giants, Barkley had arguably the greatest first season of any player in Eagles history. His 2,005 yards rushing (an Eagles record, eighth-most in NFL history) left him only 101 shy of breaking Eric Dickerson\u2019s season record of 2,105.",
      "The Eagles rested Barkley in the regular-season finale, denying him the shot to pass Dickerson.",
      "There's no sitting out in the Super Bowl \u2014 and now, there's no running back who rushed for more yards in a wire-to-wire season.",

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- A recording released by the federal government appears to include audio of the implosion of the experimental submersible that went missing on its way to the wreck of the Titanic.",
      "A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration passive acoustic recorder located about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) away from the implosion site picked up the sound, U.S. Coast Guard officials said in a statement. The recording became public on Feb. 7.",
      "The brief, staticky recording includes a loud noise that sounds somewhat like an underwater thunderclap. It then goes silent for its remaining few seconds.",
      "The Coast Guard said in a statement that the audio clip \u201crecords the suspected acoustic signature of the Titan submersible implosion\u201d on June 18, 2023, the day the submersible went missing.",
      "The implosion of the Titan killed all five people on board and set off a Coast Guard investigation and international debate about the future of private deep-sea travel. The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",
      "Concerns were raised after the implosion because of the Titan's unconventional design and its creator's refusal to submit to independent safety checks. OceanGate, the Washington state-based company that owned the submersible, suspended operations in July 2023.",
      "Titan operator Stockton Rush, who co-founded OceanGate, was among those who died in the implosion. The implosion also killed two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood; British adventurer Hamish Harding; and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet.",
      "A Coast Guard panel performing a lengthy investigation into the submersible disaster heard two weeks of testimony last September. The testimony included dramatic moments, such as when a former OceanGate scientific director said the Titan malfunctioned during a dive just a few days before its implosion.",
      "The Coast Guard is expected to release more information about the implosion in the future. A spokesperson for the agency said Wednesday the investigation is still ongoing and a final report will be released after it is completed."

In response, the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s acting director required agency heads to eliminate any programs and take down any websites that promote \u201cgender ideology.\u201d That led to widespread takedowns across government websites.",
      "Some information gradually was put back up, at least in part. But public health experts raised alarms about things that remained missing. Doctors for America, represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, sued OPM, the CDC, the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington instructed the government to restore access to several webpages and datasets that the group identified as missing from websites and to identify others that also were taken down \u201cwithout adequate notice or reasoned explanation.\u201d",
      "The nine CDC pages cited in the lawsuit were restored to how they were on Jan. 30, according to a federal health official who was not authorized to discuss it and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

      "Italy's government denies that it has spied on journalists and migrant activists using spyware, but says it will cooperate with any investigation into \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d after at least seven Italian cellphones were apparently hacked with military-grade ...",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 The Italian government denied Wednesday that it had spied on journalists and migrant activists using spyware but said it would cooperate with an investigation into \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d after at least seven Italian cellphones were apparently hacked with military-grade surveillance technology.",
      "Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service informed dozens of people across the European Union on Jan. 31 that they had been targeted in a spyware attack using technology from Israeli cyber firm Paragon Solutions.",
      "In a statement provided by Meta\u2019s Italy press office, WhatsApp said it had disrupted what it called \u201ca spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted several users, including journalists and members of civil society.\u201d",
      "After The Guardian newspaper reported the story, the Italian government confirmed on Feb. 5 that at least seven Italian cellphones were involved and that it had activated the National Cybersecurity Agency, which reports to the premier\u2019s office, to investigate.",
      "It said other targeted phones had numbers from Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.",
      "Speaking to parliament\u2019s lower chamber Wednesday, Cabinet Minister Luca Ciriani confirmed that the Italian government for many years has had a contract with Paragon Solutions to provide intelligence-gathering capabilities to fight terrorism and other threats to national security.",
      "But he insisted that the law was \u201crigorously respected\u201d and denied the government had used the technology to spy on journalists illegally. He threatened legal action against any claims to the contrary.",
      "\u201cRegardless, it\u2019s up to judicial authorities to ascertain the source of the vulnerabilities that have been claimed,\u201d he said, adding that Italian intelligence services \u201care ready to provide full support.\u201d",
      "The Guardian has reported that Paragon halted its contract with Italy after the spyware attack became public, but Ciriani said the contract with the intelligence services continues. That suggests that a second contract, perhaps with another law enforcement agency or police department, was canceled. Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper has said Paragon had two contracts with Italy for Graphite, a military-grade surveillance technology capable of hacking into encrypted smartphones.",
      "There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment sent to Paragon Solutions.",
      "Among the Italians targeted were Luca Casarini, the head of the migrant rescue group Mediterranea Saving Humans, and Francesco Cancellato, editor of the Fanpage new website, both of whose work has been critical of the government.",
      "Both confirmed in interviews Wednesday that they had been informed by WhatsApp on Jan. 31 that their phones had been infected with the spyware. The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.",
      "Cancellato said he believed he had been targeted by hackers who wanted to see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He declined to speculate on who it might have been. Fanpage has published undercover reports in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni's party and exposed neofascist behavior.",
      "Casarini, for his part, heads an aid group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean and has criticized the Italian government's support of Libya's patrols of its coasts to prevent smugglers\u2019 boats from leaving."

      "Neutrinos spew from stars like the sun and trillions stream through our bodies every second. They're known as ghost particles because their mind-bogglingly small mass makes them difficult to spot.",

      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "JD Vance is delivering a keynote speech on the final day of the Paris AI Summit during his first foreign trip since taking office as vice president",
      "PARIS -- JD Vance is delivering a keynote speech on Tuesday, the final day of the Paris AI Summit, marking his first foreign trip since taking office as vice president.",
      "Vance's address is expected to challenge Europe\u2019s regulatory approach to artificial intelligence and its moderation of content on Big Tech platforms, underscoring divergence between the United States and its allies on AI governance.",
      "The summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to debate AI\u2019s impact on security, economics, and governance.",
      "The differences were openly displayed at the summit: Europe seeks to regulate and invest, China expands access through state-backed tech giants, and the U.S., under President Donald Trump, champions a hands-off approach.",
      "Among the high-profile attendees is Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, reflecting Beijing\u2019s interest in shaping global AI standards.",
      "Vance has been an outspoken critic of European content moderation policies. He has suggested the U.S. should reconsider its NATO commitments if European governments impose restrictions on Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform, X. His Paris visit is also expected to include candid discussions on Ukraine, AI\u2019s role in global power shifts, and U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Concerns over AI\u2019s potential dangers have loomed over the summit, particularly as nations grapple with how to regulate a technology that is increasingly entwined with defense and warfare.",
      "\"I think one day we will have to find ways to control AI or else we will lose control of everything,\u201d said Admiral Pierre Vandier, NATO\u2019s commander who oversees the alliance\u2019s modernization efforts.",
      "Beyond diplomatic tensions, a global public-private partnership is being launched called \u201cCurrent AI,\u201d aimed at supporting large-scale AI initiatives for the public good.",
      "Analysts see this as an opportunity to counterbalance the dominance of private companies in AI development. However, it remains unclear whether the U.S. will support such efforts.",
      "Separately, a high-stakes battle over AI power is escalating in the private sector.",
      "A group of investors led by Musk \u2014 who now heads Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit behind OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attending the Paris summit, swiftly rejected the offer on X.",
      "In Beijing, officials on Monday condemned Western efforts to restrict access to AI tools, while Chinese company DeepSeek\u2019s new AI chatbot has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use over security concerns. China promotes open-source AI, arguing that accessibility will ensure global AI benefits.",
      "French organizers hope the summit will boost investment in Europe\u2019s AI sector, positioning the region as a credible contender in an industry shaped by U.S.-China competition.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, addressing the energy demands of AI, contrasted France\u2019s nuclear-powered approach with the U.S.\u2018s reliance on fossil fuels, quipping: France won't \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d but \"plug, baby, plug.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s diplomatic tour will continue in Germany, where he will attend the Munich Security Conference and press European allies to increase commitments to NATO and Ukraine. He may also meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Vance will discuss Ukraine and the Middle East over a working lunch with Macron.",
      "Like Trump, he has questioned U.S. aid to Kyiv and the broader Western strategy toward Russia. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance is also set to meet separately with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",

      "NEW YORK -- Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America\u2019s highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",
      "\u201cWe have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\u201d Google said last month. The company added that its maps will reflect any updates to the Geographic Names Information System, a database of more than 1 million geographic features in the U.S.",
      "Google confirmed Monday that the Gulf of America name had gone into effect. Google Maps users in the U.S. now only see the Gulf of America name, whereas those in other countries see both names. Denali, however, still appears on both Google Maps and the GNIS.",
      "And the new names on Google Maps aren't the only change the company has made following recent actions from the Trump administration. Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",
      "By Tuesday, both Apple and Microsoft\u2019s Bing made the switch from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America on their maps."

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman\u2019s push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company",
      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday.",
      "Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a \u201chappy person.\u201d",
      "\u201cProbably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,\u201d Altman said.",

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",

      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t last very long",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",
      "Vance\u2019s trip extends beyond Paris. Later this week, he will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he has said he plans to push European allies to step up their commitments to NATO and Ukraine.",
      "The summit will give some European leaders an introduction to Vance, who is making his first major overseas trip since taking office. He has signaled he will use the summit as a venue for candid discussions on AI policy and broader geopolitical issues.",
      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",
      "Vance is expected to meet separately on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to a person familiar with planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be formally announced bilateral meetings.",
      "Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children \u2014 Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel \u2014 for the trip to Europe. They were greeted in France on Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, David McCawley.",
      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",
      "Vance is attending Munich again, where he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He plans to revisit themes he raised last year, including \u201cto hit on\u201d the need for NATO allies to take on a greater share of responsibility.",
      "Leaders in Europe have been carefully watching Trump\u2019s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out of Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends \u2014 an idea that\u2019s been flatly rejected by Arab allies.",
      "The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture.",
      "A global public-private partnership named \u201cCurrent AI\u201d will be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest.",
      "The Paris summit \u201cis the first time we\u2019ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,\u201d said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. \u201cI see it as a norm-setting moment.\u201d",
      "Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by \u201cmoving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.\"",
      "However, it remains unclear if the United States will support such initiatives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complicated questions to resolve\u201d around issues like the ability to control AI systems, Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, founder of Google\u2019s DeepMind research lab, said. \u201cBut also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\u201d",
      "French organizers are also looking for the summit to ignite major investment announcements in Europe, positioning the region as a viable contender in an industry increasingly shaped by a growing U.S.-China rivalry.",
      "France plans to announce AI private investments worth a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as \u201cthe equivalent\u201d of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project.",
      "On the eve of the AI Summit, Macron posted a series of 'deepfake' videos of himself on Instagram, using artificial intelligence to manipulate his voice and image in various parodies\u2014an effort he said was meant to spark debate on AI\u2019s potential and risks.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun expressed opposition Monday to any moves to restrict access to AI tools. The release of DeepSeek has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe oppose drawing ideological lines and oppose overstretching national security concepts and politicizing economic and trade issues,\u201d Guo said.",
      "He said that China advocates for open-source AI technology and promotes the accessibility of AI services to share the benefits of artificial intelligence with all countries.",
      "Modi is co-hosting the summit with Macron in an effort to involve more global actors in AI development and prevent the sector from becoming a U.S.-China battle.",
      "India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, stressed the need for equitable access to AI to avoid \"perpetuating a digital divide that is already existing across the world.\u201d",
      "Macron will also travel on Wednesday with Modi to the southern French port city of Marseille to inaugurate an Indian Consulate there and visit the ITER nuclear research site.",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire man has become the second person known to be living with a pig kidney",
      "A New Hampshire man fought for the chance at a pig kidney transplant, spending months getting into good enough shape to be part of a small pilot study of a highly experimental treatment.",
      "His effort paid off: Tim Andrews, 66, is only the second person known to be living with a pig kidney. Andrews is free from dialysis, Massachusetts General Hospital announced Friday, and recovering so well from the Jan. 25 transplant that he left the hospital a week later.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up in the recovery room, I was a new man,\u201d Andrews told The Associated Press.",
      "Andrews\u2019 surgery comes at a turning point in the quest to tell if animal-to-human transplants could help ease the shortage of donated human organs. The first four pig organ transplants \u2014 two hearts and two kidneys \u2014 were short-lived. But the fifth xenotransplant recipient, an Alabama woman not nearly as sick as prior patients, boosted the field \u2014 thriving for now 2\u00bd months after a pig kidney transplant at NYU Langone Health in November.",
      "Doctors are moving from those one-off experiments to more formal studies. As they monitor Andrews\u2019 recovery, doctors at Mass General Brigham have Food and Drug Administration permission to perform two additional transplants in their pilot study, using gene-edited pig kidneys supplied by biotech eGenesis.",
      "And United Therapeutics, another developer of gene-edited pig organs, just won FDA approval for the world\u2019s first clinical trial of xenotransplantation. Initially, six patients will receive pig kidneys \u2014 and if they fare well over six months, up to 50 additional patients will receive transplants.",
      "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Mass General\u2019s Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, who led both Andrews\u2019 surgery and the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year. But with lessons from animal research and the prior human attempts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. And hopefully we can get to survival, kidney survival, for over two years.\u201d",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address the transplant shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews\u2019 kidneys abruptly failed about two years ago, and the Concord, New Hampshire, grandfather struggled with fatigue and complications from dialysis. He\u2019s on the transplant list but doctors warned it was a long shot. It can take seven years or more for people with Andrews\u2019 blood type to find a matching kidney. Meanwhile, people slowly get sicker on dialysis \u2014 five-year survival is about 50% \u2014 and Andrews already had had a heart attack.",
      "\u201cI have seen my mortality and I was ready to fight,\u201d Andrews said. So he asked Mass General if he could get a pig kidney instead. \u201cI told them. \u2018Anything, I\u2019ll do anything. You give me a list of things you want me to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mass General transplant nephrologist Dr. Leonardo Riella said Andrews was weak and struggling with diabetes, including a slow-healing diabetic foot ulcer that hindered walking. He\u2019d have to get more fit to be a candidate.",
      "Andrews started physical therapy and returned six months later about 30 pounds lighter and \u201crunning down the hallway almost,\u201d Riella recalled. \u201cHe was just, you know, a different person,\u201d so they started checking if he\u2019d qualify for the pilot study.",
      "One big question was cardiac fitness: Mass General\u2019s first pig kidney recipient had underlying heart disease that killed him. But Riella said intense exams showed Andrews\u2019 \u201cheart was in the best shape possible.\u201d",
      "Still, Andrews was a little nervous and sought advice from the only other person who knew what a pig kidney transplant was like \u2014 the NYU patient, Towana Looney.",
      "\u201cWe just prayed together and talked about how it would be,\u201d Andrews said of their phone calls before and after his transplant. He said Looney advised \u201cto just stay strong and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Doctors said Andrews' pig kidney turned pink and quickly began producing urine in the operating room, and since then has cleared waste normally with no signs of rejection. Andrews spent the week after his discharge in a nearby Boston hotel for daily checkups but is expected to return home to New Hampshire soon.",
      "NYU transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery said patients like those in Mass General\u2019s pilot study could be \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for early xenotransplants \u2014 not yet too sick from years of dialysis but unlikely to survive long enough for a human transplant.",
      "\u201cThose are the patients where it really makes sense for them to try something else,\u201d said Montgomery. His hospital is one of two that will be part of United Therapeutics\u2019 clinical trial later this year, which will include similar patients.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know how Andrews will fare but if the pig kidney were to fail, Riella said he\u2019d still qualify for a human transplant and, now deemed inactive on the transplant list, wouldn\u2019t lose his \u201cwaiting time\u201d that helps determine priority.",
      "Andrews now wants to return to his old dialysis clinic and \u201ctell these people there\u2019s hope, because no hope is not a good thing,\u201d he said.",

      "Two rare black wolves have been spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest, a conservation organization said Sunday.",
      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

Army trucks have also brought electricity generators to Santorini, while rescuers were deployed earlier this week.",
      "Scientists are continuing to monitor the ongoing seismic swarm of undersea quakes \u2013 as strong as magnitude 5.2 \u2013 that are mostly affecting Santorini and three nearby islands, where schools have also closed and more limited emergency measures were taken.",
      "Mitsotakis visited Santorini a day after the government declared a state of emergency to allow authorities to have faster access to state resources. Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents, tourists and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry. Experts say the seismic activity is unrelated to volcanic activity in the Aegean Sea, but are still unable to say whether the swarm could lead to a more powerful earthquake.",

      "Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been sworn in as the nation's next health secretary Thursday, his first order of business will be to investigate America's problem with chronic illnesses.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News earlier that President Donald Trump would sign an executive order creating a \"Make America Health Again\" commission and direct Kennedy \"to investigate this chronic crisis plaguing our country and the minds and the bodies of the American people.\"",
      "What that will mean exactly remains to be seen. But here are three things to watch for as Kennedy takes the helm, based on what he and Trump have said in the past:",
      "More study on food dyes or other food additives?",
      "MAHA has easily emerged as a deeply popular slogan by Kennedy as much of America struggles with obesity and chronic diseases. The question though is how to do that in a way that won't weigh down the federal budget or trigger an avalanche of legal challenges from the food and drug industry.",
      "One possible avenue for Kennedy could be to call for additional safety studies of certain ingredients used by manufacturers, including food dyes.",
      "Last month, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its authorization of one type of red food dye. \"Red Dye No. 3\" is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals but was allowed to be used by manufacturers for years because scientists didn't believe it raised cancer risk in humans at the level typically consumed. The FDA, under President Joe Biden, acted after longtime pressure by consumer advocates.",
      "But a different type, Red Dye No. 40, remains on the market and hasn't been studied by the FDA in more than 20 years. FDA and health officials say there is no evidence though that it's harmful, and food manufacturers say they need to be able to rely on ingredients generally recognized as safe.",
      "Still, health advocates argue more can be done to look at the health impacts and or do the kind of post-market monitoring of food more common in Europe.",
      "All of those efforts though will take significant federal resources and rely on a workforce that Trump has promised to cut.",
      "Rewriting discrimination rules for hospitals, doctors and insurers to exclude transgender protections",
      "Kennedy hasn't personally focused much on the question of transgender rights. But eliminating federal rules at Health and Human Services that President Barack Obama and Joe Biden pushed to protect transgender Americans is a major priority for Trump and the conservative party.",
      "Federal law prohibits sexual discrimination, but it's up to the executive branch to spell out specific rules that schools, insurers and hospitals must follow if they want to retain access to federal aid.",
      "Obama triggered a fierce legal fight in his second term when he issued federal regulations aimed at protecting transgender people from discrimination in schools and medical settings. Under rules written by Obama's Health aand Human Services Department, doctors and hospitals were told couldn't decline care for a person because of their gender identity. Insurance companies also were specifically prohibited from offering different benefits to certain groups, including transgender individuals and people with HIV.",
      "Trump quickly dropped Obama's rules in his first term, writing new rules that granted exceptions for medical providers on discrimination rules if they cited religious objections.",
      "President Joe Biden tried to resurrect Obama's initial rules but was swiftly challenged in court by Republican states, tossing the issue back to Trump. It'll now be up to HHS under Kennedy, if he's confirmed, to decide what those federal rules should say.",
      "Making it easier for parents to send unvaccinated kids to public schools",
      "School vaccine requirements are up to the states, and currently all 50 states have laws requiring certain vaccines for students to attend public schools.",
      "But HHS sets the recommendations for childhood vaccines followed by schools, while the Education Department provides vital grant money to schools used to teach low-income or children with disabilities.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to revoke spending for schools that mandate vaccines currently recommended by public health experts and HHS.",
      "\"I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,\" Trump declared last year.",
      "Such a move could have big implications for public health. According to the nonpartisan KFF, routine vaccination rates for kindergarten children is on the decline while exemptions are on the rise, including non-religious exemptions.",
      "While running for president before aligning with Trump, Kennedy rejected the numerous studies finding that childhood vaccines are safe, including several studies that debunked a myth that vaccines cause autism. During his Senate confirmation, Kennedy insisted he doesn't oppose vaccines but wants more study.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican doctor from Louisiana, said he was concerned by Kennedy's past in \"undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments.\" Facing a Republican primary next year, Cassidy decided to back Trump's pick after getting Kennedy to agree the two would work together closely.",
      "\"Ultimately, restoring trust in our public health institution is too important, and I think Mr. Kennedy can help get that done,\" Cassidy said.",
      "ABC News' Michelle Stoddart, Molly Nagle and Kelsey Walsh contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 12:59:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has questioned why autism rates have been rising over the last several years. Experts say he's missing nuance in these conversations.",
    "story": [
      "Currently, 1 in 36 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.",
      "During his confirmation hearings two weeks ago to lead the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy Jr. repeated several unfounded claims about autism.",
      "Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who has made money through books, speeches and lawsuits while sharing vaccine skepticism, refused to say that vaccines don't cause autism despite many high-quality studies finding no such link.",
      "He stated during the hearing that autism rates have \"have gone from 1 in 10,000 \u2026 and today in our children, it's one in 34.\" His claims have been repeated by President Donald Trump on Truth Social.",
      "It's unclear where Kennedy got his 1 in 10,000 statistic. In 2000, approximately 1 in 150 children in the U.S. born in 1992 were diagnosed with autism compared with 2020, during which one in 36 children born in 2012 were diagnosed, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Some psychiatrists and autism experts told ABC News it's important to highlight the rising rates of autism, and that at least Kennedy is putting a spotlight on it.",
      "\"On the bright side, I think it is really important to place an emphasis on these very high rates, it's kind of great putting a spotlight on autism, these increased rates,\" Dr. Karen Pierce, a professor in the department of neurosciences at the University of California, San Diego and co-director of the UCSD Autism Center of Excellence, told ABC News. \"We need more funding. We need more infrastructure to support everybody who is now recognized as on the spectrum. So, I think that that's actually a really good thing.\"",
      "However, the experts said Kennedy and others are missing important context about why autism rates are increasing. They say reasons may include a combination of widening of the definition of the spectrum and of types of symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as people having children at older ages, better awareness and access to diagnostic testing.",
      "\"With the rates increasing, there certainly are valid reasons for that,\" Pierce said. \"There's better awareness, and doctors can find autism a lot easier than they could before in the past\u2026. and I think a very big reason is just better record keeping nowadays and easier access to reviewing records.\"",
      "What is autism?",
      "ASD is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain, according to the CDC.",
      "People with ASD often communicate, interact, behave and learn differently, the CDC says. ASD symptoms typically begin before age 3 and can last a lifetime, although symptoms may change over time.",
      "\"There can be differences in how one is reading social cues and interpreting them, and then there's also certain behaviors that we see,\" Dr. Anna Krasno, clinical director of the Koegel Autism Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told ABC News.",
      "\"So those include a preference for sameness, a difficulty with transitioning, some cognitive and behavioral rigidity,\" she continued. \"We also see intense interests, so topics that people are super, super into and want to research, repetitive speech and motor movements. And then we also see really significant sensory differences as well.\"",
      "ASD is a spectrum, which means symptoms vary by person -- some need little support in their daily lives and some may need a great deal of support in performing day-to-day activities. Some may have advanced conversation skills and others may be nonverbal.",
      "Wider recognition, better understanding",
      "Experts told ABC News there is a wider recognition and a better understanding of what is now understood as autism/ASD.",
      "In the early 1900s, autism was described as a symptom of the most severe cases of schizophrenia, and it was considered a psychiatric disorder for many years.",
      "Traits of what is now known as ASD are built on early observations in the 1940s from Austrian-American psychiatrist Dr. Leo Kanner and Austrian physician Dr. Hans Asperger.",
      "A 1943 paper from Kanner described 11 children who presented with \"inborn autistic disturbances of affective contact\" while Asperger's 1944 report focused on boys who had marked social difficulties; unusual, circumscribed interests; and good verbal skills.",
      "It was not until 1978 that autism was recognized as a developmental disorder distinct from schizophrenia by the World Health Organization. It was also in the 1970s that psychologists and psychiatrists first came to describe autism as a spectrum.",
      "\"When autism was first described, it was new to people understanding that there was a condition that included social communication difficulties and restricted and repetitive behavior, and people primarily only recognized it when it was at its most extreme,\" Dr. Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele, division director in child and adolescent psychiatry at Columbia University, told ABC News.",
      "\"And so, if you go back and read the initial descriptions today, those are kids who we would recognize in the waiting room, recognize in the grocery store, in whom autism would be very obvious and would not require much assessment in order to diagnose,\" he continued.",
      "Better diagnostic tools",
      "Experts say another reason for the increase in rates is having better diagnostic tools than what was available decades ago.",
      "There is no single tool used as the basis of an ASD diagnosis. Typically, tools rely on descriptions from parents or caregivers of a child's development and a professional's observation of a child's behavior, according to the CDC.",
      "Currently, the Autism Society encourages all children to be screened for signs of autism by their family pediatrician three times by the age of three -- at nine, 18, and 24 or 30 months. If a child shows symptoms of ASD, more rigorous diagnostic testing can be carried out by a specialist including a full neuropsychological exam.",
      "Additionally, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) provides standard criteria for helping diagnose autism.",
      "Under DSM-5, a child meets the criteria if they have deficits in three areas of social communication and interaction and at least two of four types of restricted, repetitive behaviors.",
      "While the first edition of DSM came out in 1952, it was not until the third edition, DSM-3, in which autism was listed under an entirely new \"class\" of conditions -- the Pervasive Developmental Disorders.",
      "Veenstra-VanderWeele said the change in the criteria is another reason why the number of those diagnosed with autism rose. He likened it to changing the definition of what it means to be tall.",
      "\"To just use a crude example, if you would define somebody as tall if they were over six-foot-six, and then 30 years later, say that somebody is tall if they're over five-foot-10, you'd get very, very different numbers, and that's part of what's happened here,\" he said.",
      "Pierce added that because of limited knowledge and awareness in the past, there may have been many children who were underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed.",
      "\"It's understandable that people wouldn't even necessarily think that somebody has autism, because nobody knew what really autism was,\" she said. \"So, you know, large numbers of people were just put in the books as just having special education needs, maybe as a language delay or of having a cognitive impairment.\"",
      "Older reproductive age",
      "Some studies have suggested that people who become pregnant at an older age have an increased risk of giving birth to a child with autism.",
      "A 2012 review and meta-analysis of 16 papers from researchers in New York, London, Israel and Sweden found an association between advanced maternal age and the risk of autism.",
      "Advanced paternal age may also be a risk factor. A 2006 study conducted jointly by researchers in New York, London and Israel found that men who were above age 40 were 5.75 times more likely to have a child with ASD compared to men younger than age 30 after controlling for other factors.",
      "However, questions still swirl about whether or not there is a risk from the age of parents, and not all researchers are convinced.",
      "\"I know that there is some research looking at maternal and paternal age with regard to autism, and there's research around environmental causes,\" Krasno said. \"I think where I always firmly land is that it is inherited, and it is genetic. So, I don't know the exact correlation between age and diagnostic rate, but we do know that genetics are highly associated with diagnosis.\"",
      "Environmental risk factors",
      "Researchers are also divided over whether or not environmental risk factors play a role in causing autism.",
      "The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences says the \"clearest evidence\" involves events before and during birth, including prenatal exposure to air pollution or pesticides; maternal obesity or diabetes; extreme prematurity; and periods of oxygen deprivation to the brain during birth.",
      "\"But these factors alone are unlikely to cause autism. Rather, they appear to increase a child's likelihood for developing autism when combined with genetic factors,\" NIEHS states on its website.",
      "Pierce said from the studies she's read, evidence suggests autism is a genetic condition. She added the environmental factors may play a role but \"to a small degree.\"",
      "Myth that vaccines cause autism",
      "The myth that vaccines cause autism was born out of a fraudulent 1998 study, hypothesizing that the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine caused intestinal inflammation, which, in turn, led to the development of autism.",
      "The paper has since been discredited by health experts, retracted from the journal in which it was published, and its primary author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license after an investigation found he had acted \"dishonestly and irresponsibly\" in conducting his research.",
      "More than a dozen high-quality studies have since found no evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism.",
      "However, Kennedy has held fast to this claim, saying during a 2023 interview on Fox News that he believes autism comes from vaccines.",
      "During the HHS confirmation hearings, Kennedy said he was not \"anti-vaccine\" but \"pro-safety.\" At the same time, Kennedy repeatedly refused throughout the hearings to say that vaccines were not linked to autism, while still insisting he supports vaccination in general.",
      "Experts told ABC News there is no evidence to suggest a link between vaccines and autism, and perpetuating the myth can be dangerous.",
      "\"Once there's a lie and it's spread, it doesn't matter that it's a lie. Once people hear it, then they believe that it's true despite all of the Herculean efforts to disprove it and debunk it,\" Pierce said. \"There's no evidence for it whatsoever, and there's actually extremely, as far as scientific evidence is concerned, there's extremely strong evidence to suggest absolutely not.\"",
      "Christopher Banks, president and CEO of the Autism Society of America, said the false claim that vaccines cause autism can divert financial resources from much-needed research.",
      "\"Instead of advancing support and therapies, time and funding are wasted disproving a debunked theory,\" he said. \"This misinformation also fuels stigma, implying that autism is something to be feared rather than understood and supported, leading to discrimination against autistic individuals.\"",

      "ABC News correspondents report on the impact of the administration's crackdown.",
      "Immigration has always been the lifeblood of America, helping to create a unique melting pot of culture and history. However, the fight over who belongs, and who does not, is as old as the country itself.",
      "Since his inauguration last month, President Donald Trump has been testing the limits of his power through a flurry of executive orders. He's working to deliver on his campaign promise to crack down on immigration by targeting areas like birthright citizenship and refugee status.",
      "Deportations are ramping up, even as border crossings are down. The administration is going so far as to use Guantanamo Bay -- the military base in Cuba -- to house the influx of arrested migrants.",
      "ABC News is on the ground, across the country -- reporting on sweeping immigration changes. Watch \"Immigration Crackdown\" tonight on a special edition of \"Nightline.\"",
      "Correspondents from ABC News deployed across the nation to see what impact the Trump administration's crackdown is having across America.",
      "Denver, Colorado",
      "Last Wednesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids began in an apartment building in the early morning hours. Working with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and FBI agents, they knocked on doors, stopped cars and took multiple people into custody.",
      "It was just one of multiple immigration enforcement operations happening throughout the Denver area that day.",
      "Law enforcement said publicly that they were targeting the most dangerous undocumented individuals. However, people ABC News spoke with said agents went door to door, questioning residents at every unit -- more than a hundred in total -- demanding identification and asking if drugs were inside.",
      "While large-scale operations like this can net arrests, residents said going door to door created unreasonable panic and fear for everyone involved.",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources told ABC News that the operation yielded the arrest of just one alleged gang member. The sources said 29 people were also detained.",
      "The southern border in Texas",
      "The enforcement actions have also created tension in the communities surrounding U.S. ports of entry along the southern border, especially in Texas. These ports are the economic lifeblood of their regions, both by water and by land, but they are also where U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is focused on stopping the flow of both migrants and illegal drugs.",
      "At the port of entry in McAllen, more than 700,000 trucks of cargo -- worth more than $50 billion -- are scanned every year. CBP took ABC News inside its warehouse, where they inspect all that cargo -- stacks of vacuums, car parts and produce, looking for illegal shipments or drugs.",
      "Director Carlos Rodriguez highlighted the need for additional funding to pay for more manpower and improved technology.",
      "\"Just last night we had a shipment of jalapenos and cucumbers at the port of entry -- it\u2019s over 2,000 pounds of methamphetamine and heroin,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Central Valley, California",
      "The idea of cutting off all illegal crossings is popular with some Americans, but other groups urge a cautious approach on enforcing the law against groups of undocumented workers who are already here. In California, roughly half of all farm workers are undocumented immigrants.",
      "At a dairy farm in Tulare County, farmer Peter de Jong told ABC News he supports Trump's immigration crackdown. He said he's hopeful for systemic reforms because his farm relies heavily on migrant labor and he would like to see a pathway to keep them here in this country legally.",
      "\"We have encouraged them to apply for green cards and go through the process, but it's a very slow process,\" de Jong said. \"It's expensive, too.\"",
      "Chicago, Illinois",
      "The battle over immigration has also spilled into federal and state courtrooms, with the Trump administration filing suit against the city of Chicago and state of Illinois, accusing them of obstructing federal immigration policy. Illinois denies this accusation.",
      "Chicago is a sanctuary city, which means that it largely does not disclose immigration status to authorities or deny services if a resident is undocumented.",
      "Some residents told ABC News they're feeling the impact of the Trump administration's crackdown. On the city's north side, many migrants gather near a busy shopping area to look for work each day.",
      "One man from Colombia said he has been in the U.S. for a year and a half, and looks for whatever work is available so he can support his family.",
      "\"A lot of people drive by and look at me like I\u2019m a dog, like I\u2019m a derelict of society,\" he told ABC News.",

    "summary": "During her first full day as director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard will meet with U.S. allies at the Munich Security Conference.",
    "story": [
      "Gabbard will meet counterparts from Britain, France, Australia, and Germany.",
      "During her first full day as director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where she will hold 30 bilateral meetings with counterparts, including key U.S. allies Great Britain, France, Australia, and Germany, Alexa Henning, deputy DNI for strategy and communications told ABC News.",
      "Gabbard, who sworn into office Wednesday afternoon after the Senate voted to confirm her in the morning, is expected to deliver remarks at a luncheon during the conference. She will be joined by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who are also attending.",
      "During her confirmation hearing in January, Gabbard previewed her priorities as head of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), stating that President Donald Trump's reelection was aimed at breaking the cycle of failure within the intelligence community, ending \"the weaponization/politicization of the IC and begin to restore trust in those who have been charged with the critical task of securing our nation.\"",
      "To assess the global threat environment, Gabbard will identify \"where gaps in our intelligence exist, integrate intelligence elements, increase information-sharing, and ensure unbiased, apolitical, objective collection and analysis to support the president and policymakers' decision-making,\" according to a list of priorities obtained by ABC News.",
      "Her priorities also emphasize the need to end polarization of the intelligence community, stating that her goal is to \"ensure clear mission focus to the IC on its core mission of unbiased, apolitical collection and analysis of intelligence to secure our nation.\"",
      "The DNI also stresses that rebuilding \"trust through transparency and accountability,\" is a national security imperative, according to the document.",
      "Like many government agencies in the second Trump administration, Gabbard's focus is on reforming ODNI, which was created in response to intelligence failures leading up to 9/11. She aims to \"assess and address efficiency, redundancy, and effectiveness across ODNI to ensure focus of personnel and resources is focused on our core mission of national security,\" according to the document.",
      "During the confirmation process, the former Hawaii congresswoman met with more than half of the Senate over two months. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed frustration with recent intelligence failures, according to sources with knowledge of proceedings. Gabbard continued meeting with senators on Capitol Hill up until the eve of her nomination.",
      "Gabbard was grilled by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle about her reversal on a key surveillance tool, Section 702 of the FISA, and her refusal to label former National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden a traitor during contentious confirmation hearings on Capitol Hill last month.",
      "The Senate confirmed her nomination, 52-48, on Wednesday. Gabbard, a former Democrat turned Republican, received no Democratic votes. The only Republican to vote against her was former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said, \"The nation should not have to worry that the intelligence assessments the President receives are tainted by a Director of National Intelligence with a history of alarming lapses in judgment.\"",
      "Another key \"no\" vote came from independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose presidential campaign Gabbard endorsed in 2016 after stepping down as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.",
      "According to the document obtained by ABC News, Gabbard plans to work with lawmakers to ensure responsiveness to their requests for intelligence. Issues of concern include the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack in Israel; the 2024 Syrian rebel takeover; failures to identify the source of the COVID-19 outbreak, Anomalous Health Incidents (AHIs), also known as \"Havana Syndrome,\" Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) -- objects in air, sea or space that defy scientific explanation -- drones and more.",
      "Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, has served 22 years in the Army National Guard and Reserve, including deployments to Iraq, Kuwait, and Djibouti. She is the first female DNI to have served in the military and plans to continue to serve in the Reserve, which ODNI regulations permit.",
      "She plans to use her experience in the military and in Congress to bring \"fresh eyes\" as she assumes the role of America's top intelligence official, according to the document.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk called on Thursday for the United States to \u201cdelete entire agencies\u201d from the federal government as part of his push under President Donald Trump to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.",
      "Musk offered a wide-ranging survey via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, of what he described as the priorities of the Trump administration interspersed with multiple references to \u201cthermonuclear warfare\u201d and the possible dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cWe really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people \u2014 democracy,\u201d Musk said, wearing a black T-shirt that read: \u201cTech Support.\u201d He also joked that he was the \u201cWhite House\u2019s tech support,\u201d borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",
      "\u201cI think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t remove the roots of the weed, then it\u2019s easy for the weed to grow back.\u201d",
      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance on Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Trump\u2019s blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That\u2019s included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role imbued his comments with more weight beyond being the world\u2019s wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\u201cA lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\u201d Musk said, referring to Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cThere's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?\u2019\u201d",
      "He added that the U.S. under Trump is \u201cless interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\u201d",
      "There are \u201ctimes the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\u201d Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\u201d he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\u201cIf hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there\u2019s too many men in power and execute them,\u201d Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \u201ckind of scary.\u201d",
      "He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\u201d A court filing Wednesday on Musk's behalf in the OpenAI dispute said he'd withdraw his bid if the ChatGPT maker drops its plan to convert into a for-profit company.",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \u201cDubai Loop\u201d project in line with his work in the Boring Company \u2014 which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit.",
      "A later statement from Dubai's crown prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, said the city-state and the Boring Company \u201cwill explore the development\u201d of a 17-kilometer (10.5-mile) underground network with 11 stations that could transport over 20,000 passengers an hour. He offered no financial terms for the deal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a wormhole,\" Musk promised. \"You just wormhole from one part of the city \u2014 boom \u2014 and you're out in another part of the city.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 07:40:08 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge says he will continue to pause the Trump administration's federal employee buyout offer until he issues a ruling on a preliminary injunction.",
    "story": [
      "A DOJ lawyer called the buyout offer a \"humane off-ramp\" for federal employees.",
      "A federal judge in Boston said he denied the request to block the buyout offer because the federal unions who brought the case lacked standing to sue and because the District Court lacks jurisdiction to review the case.",
      "Three federal employee unions -- with the support of 20 Democratic attorneys general -- have argued in a lawsuit that the Office of Personnel Management's deferred resignation offer is an \"unlawful ultimatum\" to force the resignation of government workers under the \"threat of mass termination.\"",
      "According to U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr., the federal unions who challenged the policy are not directly impacted by the buyout offer; rather they are subject to collateral impacts such as a reduction in union membership and needing to answer their members' questions about the policy.",
      "\"The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork Directive but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees. This is not sufficient,\" the judge wrote.",
      "The judge also determined that the district court lacks jurisdiction to review the dispute because the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute sets out an administrative review process before courts can take over.",
      "\"According to this complex scheme, disputes must first be administratively exhausted before the employing agency and the relevant administrative review board and any further challenges are properly heard in a court of appeals,\" the order said.",
      "O'Toole Jr. did not include any interpretation about how the buyout deadline is impacted in his order.",
      "\"This Boston Buyout Ruling is the first of many legal wins for the President. The Court dissolved the injunction due to a lack of standing. This goes to show that lawfare will not ultimately prevail over the will of 77 million Americans who supported President Trump and his priorities,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "During an hour-long hearing Monday, a lawyer for the Department of Justice framed the deferred resignation offer as a \"humane off-ramp\" for federal employees before President Donald Trump enacts sweeping changes to \"rebalance and reorganize the federal workforce.\"",
      "\"President Trump campaigned on a promise to reform the federal workforce,\" DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton said, outlining Trump's plan to reduce the size of the federal government and his return-to-office executive order. \"We understand these announcements may have come as a disappointment for some in the federal workforce.\"",
      "Hamilton argued that any further delay of the buyout would cause irreparable harm because the Trump administration plans to enact the next steps of reshaping the federal government as soon as the buyout window closes.",
      "Elena Goldstein, a lawyer representing the unions that brought the challenge, hammered the Trump administration for attempting to enforce an \"unprecedented program\" with a \"slapdash exploding deadline\"",
      "\"For the last two weeks, confusion has rained for millions of career civil servants,\" Goldstein said. \"This is a program of unprecedented magnitude that raises questions about the rationality of OPM's decision-making.\"",
      "The buyout offer, part of Trump's effort to trim the size of government through billionaire Elon Musk's newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, was sent out two weeks ago in an email with the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" -- the same language Musk used when he slashed jobs at Twitter after taking over that company in 2022.",
      "The offer from the Office of Personnel Management offered full pay and benefits until September for any federal employee who accepted a deferred resignation by Feb. 6, with no obligation to work after they accepted the agreement.",
      "While Goldstein acknowledged that Trump has the right to downsize the federal government, she emphasized that OPM has not gone through any of the steps necessary to carry out such a sweeping move -- including analyzing the cost and benefits of their approach, evaluating its impact on the government's function, and accessing potential conflicts of interest for Musk. She added that the exact terms of the buyout are \"shifting\" for thousands of employees who have gotten inconsistent guidance from their agency.",
      "\"OPM appears to be making this up as they are going along,\" she said. \"When the government wants to decide, there are ways to do this correctly ... none of that happened here in the two weeks since they enacted this program.\"",
      "Arguing for the government, Hamilton criticized the plaintiffs' argument as \"legally incoherent and at odds with their theory of the case,\" because a further delay of the buyout would \"insert more uncertainty\" into the lives of federal employees.",
      "While the plaintiffs raised concerns that the buyout program violates federal law by using money that Congress never appropriated, Hamilton attempted to push back on the claim that the buyout changes the government's financial obligations.",
      "\"Nothing about the voluntary resignation changes anything about the federal government's financial obligations. It just changes what employees are expected to do and not do during their period of employment,\" Hamilton said.",
      "Goldstein argued that a preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent what she said was an unlawful offer to reshape the federal government while the Trump administration continues to \"put additional pressure on employees.\"",
      "\"This is an unprecedented action taken on an unprecedented timeline,\" she said.",
      "Just hours ahead of Thursday's original deadline for employees to accept the offer, Judge O'Toole -- who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton -- temporarily blocked the offer until Monday so he could consider issuing a temporary restraining offer pausing the order.",
      "\"I enjoined the defendants from taking any action to implement the so-called 'Fork Directive' pending the completion of briefing and oral argument on the issues,\" Judge O'Toole said in his ruling. \"I believe that's as far as I want to go today.\"",
      "The Trump administration, in response, \"extended\" the deadline for the offer, which more than 65,000 federal employees have already taken.",
      "The unions who brought the lawsuit argued that Trump exceeded his authority as president with the offer, which they described as a \"slapdash resignation program.\"",
      "According to the plaintiffs, Trump's offer violates federal law, lacks congressionally appropriated funding, and does not offer employees reassurance that the president would follow through with the offer. Their claim in part relies on a federal law from the 1940s called the Administrative Procedure Act that governs how federal agencies create and enforce rules.",
      "\"In the tech universe, 'move fast and break things' is a fine motto in part because they're not playing with the public's money, and it's expected that most initiatives are going to fail,\" Loyola Marymount law professor Justin Leavitt told ABC News. \"Congress knows that, so in 1946 they basically said, 'When agencies do stuff ... they have to be careful about it. They've got to consider all aspects of the problem.\"",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that the buyout is unlawful because it relies on funding that Congress has yet to appropriate, violating the Antideficiency Act.",
      "\"Defendants' ultimatum divides federal workers into two groups: (1) those who submit their resignations to OPM for a promised period of pay without the requirement to work, and (2) those who have not and are therefore subject to threat of mass termination,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government have pushed back on those claims, arguing that Trump has the legal authority to provide the buyout for employees within the federal branch, and that any further delay would do more harm than good.",
      "\"Extending the deadline for the acceptance of deferred resignation on its very last day will markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the Administration's efforts to reform the federal workforce,\" DOJ attorney Joshua E. Gardner wrote in a filing last week.",

      "Taken to the extreme, the order could also pave the way for shrinking the U.S. diplomatic footprint abroad \u2014 prompting the State Department to rethink the presence of U.S. embassies in certain countries altogether.",
      "The department might reconsider membership in some international organizations or withdraw from existing diplomatic agreements.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to face legal challenges over the order, but the law that codifies the administration of the foreign service is fairly deferential to the secretary of state.",
      "In the past two weeks, an overwhelming majority of U.S. Agency for International Development employees who were embedded in embassies have already been put on administrative leave.",
      "This has led a number of ambassadors and chiefs of mission to register complaints with department leadership, saying they don\u2019t have the staff needed to oversee the USAID programs that are still in operation, according to communications reviewed by ABC News.",
      "The Trump administration has also already fired contractors who worked on key embassy functions, including diplomatic security, and it is considering further reductions that could include untenured Diplomatic Security Service direct hires, sources said."

      "President Donald Trump has just started his second term, the last one permitted under the U.S. Constitution",
      "President Donald Trump has just started his second term, his last one permitted under the U.S. Constitution. But he's already started making quips about serving a third one.",
      "\u201cAm I allowed to run again?\u201d Trump joked during the House Republican retreat in Florida last month. Whether teasing or taunting, it seems to be part of a pattern. Just a week after he won election last fall, Trump suggested in a meeting with House Republicans that he might want to stick around after his second term was over.",
      "\"I suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s so good we got to figure something else out,\u2019\u201d Trump said to laughs from the lawmakers.",
      "Over the years, Trump and his supporters have often joked about him serving more than his two constitutionally permitted terms. But his musings often spark alarm among his critics, given that he unsuccessfully tried to overturn his 2020 election loss and has since pardoned supporters who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But Trump, who will be 82 when his term ends, has repeatedly said that this will be his last term. Trying for another also would flatly violate the Constitution.",
      "Here are some questions and answers related to Trump's occasional comments about a third term:",
      "\u201cNo person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice,\u201d begins the 22nd Amendment, adopted after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected four times in a row. He was last elected in 1944.",
      "It's a fairly straightforward ban on serving more than two terms. Some Trump supporters argue the language is meant to apply only to two consecutive terms because Roosevelt's terms were consecutive, but notably that's not what the amendment says.",
      "Others contend that because the ban is just on being \u201celected\" more than twice, Trump could run as the next president's vice president and, if the ticket won, could simply replace that person if he or she resigns. To put it mildly, that would be quite a complex plan to pull off, in no small part because Trump would be 82 during the next election, a year older than former President Joe Biden was during last year's campaign.",
      "At least one Republican in Congress has been bold enough to propose a constitutional amendment that would allow Trump to seek another term. It has no chance of going anywhere, given the high bar for amending the Constitution.",
      "Even assuming Trump would attempt another run, a combination of election officials and courts would virtually ensure that he stayed off the ballot.",
      "State officials have long kept would-be candidates off presidential ballots if they didn't meet the basic constitutional criteria, such as being a natural-born U.S. citizen or being at least 35 years old. They would do the same with someone clearly violating the limit on presidential terms.",
      "A version of this unfolded in 2023, when a few states tried to keep Trump off the ballot because they found he violated the 14th Amendment's ban on officials who engaged in insurrection. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed those decisions because no one had ever used the insurrection clause on a presidential candidate before and there were a lot of legal questions about its implementation.",
      "There would be no similar questions about the meaning of the 22nd Amendment, said Derek Muller, a professor at Notre Dame Law School.",
      "\u201cYou would not have the factual disputes, so it would be much wider,\u201d Muller said of the number of states keeping Trump off their ballots. \u201cI'm not persuaded the Supreme Court is going to roll over.\u201d",
      "Trump has a long history of taunting his critics to flex his power, but there also could be a strategic reason for his keeping the third-term discussion alive.",
      "Trump is a lame duck president in his final term. Because these politicians will never be on the ballot for the same office again, their political clout usually wanes quickly. The third-term flirtation is a way to try to convince people that Trump will be around in the future.",
      "Trump's aggressive actions at the start of his new term shows that Trump knows his time is dwindling, Muller said.",
      "\u201cHe's governing like he's a lame duck right now, with nothing to lose,\u201d Muller said.",

      "\"I've worked at CoreCivic for 32 years, and this is truly one of the most exciting periods of my career,\" CEO Damon Hininger said Tuesday on the company's earnings call. \"We anticipate significant growth opportunities, perhaps the most significant growth in our company's history over the next several years.\"",
      "\"The change in presidential administration on Jan. 20 has ushered in significant policy and legislative changes that directly impact our business,\" Hininger said on the public call, which comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased its apprehensions of people alleged to be in the country illegally.",
      "Hininger told shareholders that the company is taking proactive steps to prepare facilities and beds in anticipation of potential new contracts with ICE.",
      "CoreCivic executives on the call said they currently speak almost \"hourly\" with ICE officials and with members of the administration, and have \"active tours going on\" at their facilities.",
      "\"We've got a proposal in front of ICE for 28,000 beds,\" one executive said, adding that the offer could result in more than a billion dollars in revenue for the company.",
      "The 28,000 beds offered to ICE comes from vacant facilities that are not currently activated, as well as from availability in existing facilities and from the South Texas Family Residential Center, the nation's largest migrant detention center that was closed in 2024, executives said.",
      "ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "In response to questions about the administration's decision to use Guantanamo Bay and a prison in El Salvador to hold migrant detainees, executives for CoreCivic said they believe their facilities are \"superior\" to the alternatives when it comes to cost and logistics.",

      "The CoreCivic CEO also said he believes the company's facilities are less likely to face litigation, and said they are \"more humane than the other alternatives.\"",
      "\"We're feeling very encouraged by the conversations with ICE to date,\" Hininger said. \"We've got a lot of activity going on in the organization, a lot of opportunities, so it's a very exciting time within the company.\"",

    "story": [
      "The eight IGs claim Trump broke the law when he attempted to terminate them.",
      "Eight inspectors general who were fired by President Donald Trump last month are suing the federal government over what they allege are \"unlawful and unjustified purported termination[s].\"",
      "The eight inspectors general claimed Trump broke the law when he attempted to terminate them without justifying their removal or giving Congress 30-day notices.",
      "\"The purported firings violated unambiguous federal statutes -- each enacted by bipartisan majorities in Congress and signed into law by the President -- to protect Inspectors General from precisely this sort of interference with the discharge of their critical, non-partisan oversight duties,\" they said in the lawsuit.",
      "In an interview with ABC News' Rachel Scott, Robert Storch, the Defense Department inspector general and one of the eight plaintiffs in the new lawsuit against the administration, said people \"should be concerned that the very valuable system of independent, nonpartisan oversight\" is \"being threatened\" by efforts to remove the watchdogs from office without properly notifying Congress.",
      "\"The process ensures that if a president wants to dismiss an inspector general ... that Congress, and through it the American people, understands why the president wants to do that,\" he said, adding that it sends a \"horrible message\" to the public.",
      "Trump attempted to fire 17 inspectors general during his first week in office, sending a two-sentence email to each of the independent watchdogs. The eight inspectors general who brought the lawsuit, from the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, State, Agriculture, Education and Labor, as well as the Small Business Administration, were responsible for overseeing a combined $5 trillion in appropriated funds and 3.5 million federal employees, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"Firing 18 now, regrettably 19 after the [firing of the USAID inspector general] last night, sends a message that that this sort of independent oversight is something that's not desired when, in fact, it's incredibly important for the American people,\" Storch said.",
      "The lawsuit said that because Trump allegedly failed to take the necessary steps to terminate the employees, the terminations are \"legal nullities\" and the inspectors general technically continue to serve in their lawfully appointed roles. The plaintiffs called out the Trump administration for revoking the officials' access to their computers and government-issued phones and their ability to enter their government buildings.",
      "\"These actions have had their intended effect of making it impossible for the IGs to perform their lawful duties,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "The inspectors general are asking a federal court in Washington, D.C., to declare that their purported terminations are \"legally ineffective,\" enjoin the Trump administration from preventing them from doing their jobs and affirm that they continue to serve in their roles until the Trump administration follows the legal avenue to remove them.",
      "Before Storch's confirmation to serve at the Pentagon under President Joe Biden, where his office investigated Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's secret hospitalization and tracked the shipment of U.S. weapons to Ukraine, he served as inspector general at the National Security Agency -- a position to which he was nominated by Trump.",
      "\"Administrations are entitled to whatever priorities they want to have. Elections have consequences,\" he said. \"Our job is to do independent, nonpartisan oversight that, whatever their priorities are, improves the economy, the effiiciency, the effectiveness and that ferrets out waste, fraud and abuse. ... That's really a complicated job.\"",

      "Texas is scheduled to execute a man convicted of killing two men as part of a 2004 dispute with his boss at a strip club, and then years later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system when he used a cellphone smuggled into death row to th...",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas man who murdered his strip club manager and another man, then later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system when he used a cellphone smuggled into death row to threaten a lawmaker, was scheduled to be executed Thursday.",
      "Richard Lee Tabler, 46, would be the second inmate executed in Texas in a little over a week, with two more scheduled by the end of April. He's set to receive a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "Tabler was condemned for the Thanksgiving 2004 shooting deaths of Mohammed-Amine Rahmouni, 28, and Haitham Zayed, 25, in a remote area near Killeen in Central Texas. Rahmouni was the manager of a strip club where Tabler worked until he was banned from the place. Zayed was a friend of Rahmouni, and police said both men were killed in a late-night meeting to buy some stolen stereo equipment that was actually a planned ambush.",
      "Tabler also confessed to killing two teenage girls who worked at the club, Tiffany Dotson, 18, and Amanda Benefield, 16. He was indicted but never tried in their killings.",
      "Tabler has repeatedly asked the courts that his appeals be dropped and that he be put to death. He also has changed his mind on that point several times, and his attorneys have questioned whether he is mentally competent to make that decision. Tabler\u2019s prison record includes at least two instances of attempted suicide, and he was previously granted a stay of execution in 2010.",
      "\u201cPetitioner has spent the last twenty years in the Courts, and see's no point in wasting this Courts time, nor anyone else's,\u201d Tabler wrote to the state Court of Criminal Appeals on Dec. 9, 2024, after his current execution date was set.",
      "Tabler's death row phone calls in 2008 to state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston, prompted an unprecedented lockdown of more than 150,000 inmates in the the nation's second-largest prison system. Some were confined to their cells for weeks while officers swept more than 100 prisons to seize hundreds of items of contraband, including cellphones.",
      "Whitmire led a Senate committee with oversight of state prisons, and said at the time that Tabler warned him that he knew the names of his children and where they lived. Whitmire, through a spokesperson at the mayor's office, declined to comment on Tabler's pending execution.",
      "The ACLU appealed Tabler\u2019s case to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, claiming he was denied adequate legal representation during his lower court appeals by attorneys who refused to participate in hearings at what they said was his request.",
      "The ACLU appeal argued that Tabler's attorneys ignored a psychological exam that determined he had a \u201cdeep and severe constellation of mental illnesses\u201d that had been ignored since childhood. The court refused to halt his execution.",
      "Tabler worked at a bar called TeaZers and investigators said he had a conflict with his boss, Rahmouni, who allegedly said he could have Tabler's family \u201cwiped out\u201d for $10.",
      "Tabler recruited a friend, a soldier at nearby Fort Cavazos, and lured Rahmouni and Zayed to a meeting. Tabler shot them both in their car, then pulled Rahmouni out and had the friend record a video of him shooting Rahmouni again.",
      "Tabler later confessed to the killings. During the sentencing phase of his trial, prosecutors introduced Tabler's written and videotaped statements that he also killed Dotson and Benefield days later because he was worried they would tell people he killed the men.",
      "Investigators said that before he was arrested, Tabler called the Bell County Sheriff's Office to taunt deputies about the murders, and threatened to kill more strip club employees and undercover law enforcement at the club.",

      "A New Hampshire town and a bakery owner are scheduled for trial in a First Amendment dispute about a painting of a sun and pastries",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- A First Amendment dispute over a bright painting that shows sunbeams shining down on a mountain range made of sprinkle-covered chocolate and strawberry doughnuts, a blueberry muffin, a cinnamon roll and other pastries is scheduled for trial Thursday.",
      "A federal judge in New Hampshire will consider whether a town is infringing on the free speech rights of the bakery owner who's displaying the mural over his business.",
      "\u201cI think the whole town is following this story,\u201d said Sean Young, the owner of Leavitt's Country Bakery in Conway, a community of more than 10,000 people near the White Mountains that draws skiers, nature lovers and shoppers. Some residents want regulations enforced as they worry about overdevelopment in the tourist town.",
      "The mural atop the bakery, which was founded over 45 years ago, is a creation of local high school art students. When it went up in June 2022, the painting attracted a lot of compliments and visitors, including one from a town zoning officer.",
      "The zoning board decided that the painting was not so much art as advertising. The board determined it was a sign, and so it could not remain as is because of its size. At about 90 square feet (8.6 square meters), it\u2019s four times bigger than the local sign code allows.",
      "If the painting didn't show what's sold inside \u2014 baked goods \u2014 it wouldn't be considered a sign and could stay, board members said.",
      "Lawyers for the town say that it has shown that \u201crestricting the size of signs serves the significant government interest of preserving the town\u2019s aesthetics, promoting safety, and ensuring equal enforcement,\u201d according to a court document.",
      "Young was told to modify or remove the painting. Faced with possible misdemeanor criminal charges and fines after his appeals were rejected, he sued the town in federal court in 2023, saying his freedom of speech rights were violated.",
      "\u201cGovernment officials don\u2019t get to tell people, including entrepreneurs and businesses, what they can and can\u2019t paint,\u201d the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, which is representing Young, said in a news release at the time. \"And no one can say with a straight face that Leavitt\u2019s mural would be any safer, healthier or more aesthetically pleasing if it portrayed flowers instead of pastries.\u201d",
      "Young is asking for $1 in damages. His lawyers say the town's definition of a sign is overly broad and that the town hasn't shown that anything bad will happen if the painting continues to stay up. It hasn't been removed.",
      "Part of Conway's sign code states that the town \"has no intention of restricting individual free speech, but the town does recognize its right to place reasonable restrictions upon commercial speech.\u201d",
      "The town has enforced its sign code against other businesses. In 2006, for example, it said an ice cream parlor's trash cans, which were shaped like ice cream cones, were signs. The business asked for and got permission from the town to use the cans. In another case, a sporting goods store agreed to remove window screens with photos of mountain bikes and skis after the town determined they were signs.",
      "Young's lawsuit was paused for a few months in 2023 as residents considered revising how the town defines signs, in a way that would have allowed the painting to stay up. But that measure was seen as too broad and complex, and it failed to pass.",
      "Last year, voters passed a new ordinance that requires applicants to meet criteria for art on public and commercial property but it has not applied to Young's case."

      "The noted author was on the witness stand for just about an hour, during which he described the 2022 assault in front of a shocked audience in precise detail. He also told some jokes with the comfort of someone experienced at public speaking.",

      "\u201cThen there were a number of blows to my chest and torso. Three stab wounds down the center of my chest,\u201d he said, adding there were also injuries to his waist area. While lying on the stage, Rushdie recalled \u201ca sense of great pain and shock and aware of the fact that there was an enormous quantity of blood that I was lying in.\"",
      "\u201cIt was a stab wound in my eye and intensely painful, and after that, I was screaming because of the pain and I couldn\u2019t see out of the eye any more,\" Rushdie said.",
      "\u201cIt occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought.\u201d",
      "Defense lawyer Lynn Shaffer got a chance to question Rushdie about the attack.",
      "\u201cI believe you said you are a writer,\u201d she began.",
      "Later she asked Rushdie if he\u2019d be surprised that \u2019Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary,\u201d in which he makes a cameo, was her favorite movie.",
      "\u201cI am surprised,\u201d Rushdie said, joking that it was \u201cmy most important work.\u201d",
      "The only hint at a possible defense strategy was a question about whether trauma can affect memories.",
      "Rushdie acknowledged that he has a false memory, that he thought he stood up when he saw the attacker approaching, but that wasn\u2019t true.",
      "She then challenged him to remember how many times he was struck.",

      "\u201cEveryone was vulnerable if I lost this,\u201d Levy said outside of the Baton Rouge courthouse Tuesday night, specifically speaking about other university faculty members and students. \u201cSo my win is their win.\u201d",
      "The legal battle stems from an anonymous student complaint pertaining to what the professor said on the first day of a criminal justice course in January.",
      "A transcript of a recording taken in the class, shared in court and published by The Advocate, showed that Levy said \u201cf(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) the governor\u201d as well as told students he could put them in jail if they broke his no-recording policy. Levy said that the comments were made in a \u201cjoking manner\u201d and multiple students who testified also interpreted it as humor.",
      "Additionally, Levy \u2014 who told students he was a Democrat \u2014 used the expletive to talk about Trump, referring to the November presidential election and saying \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)r won.\u201d",
      "Within a few days, university administration informed Levy he had been relieved from his teaching responsibilities \u201cpending an investigation into student complaints of inappropriate statements made in your class,\u201d according to Levy's lawsuit.",
      "Levy's attorney, Jill Craft, said that the professor's removal violated his academic freedom and lacked his right to due process. Jimmy Faircloth, Jr., an attorney representing the university, argued that initial findings showed Levy had created a classroom environment that could be demeaning to some students, specifically those who don't share the same political views as the professor. Faircloth also said that the lawsuit was premature, as Levy was only removed from his classroom \u2014 but still being paid and allowed to be on campus \u2014 as a full investigation continued.",
      "In his ruling from the bench on Tuesday night, 19th Judicial District Judge Tarvald Smith said he saw no problem with Levy's vulgarity under the context presented and that negative comments about politicians are \u201ca way of life.\u201d",
      "Additionally, Smith said he hopes the state-funded university will allow professors to \u201cinvite rigorous debate and dialogue\u201d to prepare law students who are going into a career field where they will face opposing opinions every day.",
      "\u201cYour client should get back to the business of training lawyers and let professors teach,\u201d Smith told Faircloth.",
      "Throughout the hearing, one name repeatedly mentioned was Gov. Landry, a Republican and ally of Trump's. Since taking office last year, Landry has made national news for his sweeping conservative agenda, which includes a law requiring that the Ten Commandments be posted in every public classroom, a Texas-style immigration measure, expansion of death row execution methods and a measure classifying abortion pills as dangerous controlled substances.",
      "Last November, Landry publicly called on Louisiana State University to discipline another law professor, Nicholas Bryner, who during a lecture criticized Trump and students who voted for him. Bryner remains employed by the school. Levy cited that particular situation as a reason for his no-recording policy in class.",
      "In Levy's case, Landry also took to X, saying the professor's conduct \u201cshould not be tolerated.\u201d Levy testified that he received death threats following the governor's post.",
      "Landry\u2019s office did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday.",
      "While it has been questioned by some residents, students and Levy's attorney if the governor played any role in the professor\u2019s removal, Faircloth said that is \u201ca conspiratorial narrative\u201d and there was \u201cno political motivation.\u201d",
      "University President William Tate IV testified on Tuesday, that it was solely his decision to remove Levy, adding that he \u201cnever talked to the governor about this matter.\u201d Tate said he reviewed a transcript of what Levy said and felt the \u201ctotality of it was over the line of what I would expect to see in a classroom.\u201d",
      "Other\u2019s continue to have worries that their lectures may be scrutinized, especially if they oppose the views of a sitting elected official. Among those with trepidation is Professor Patrick Martin IV, who teaches jurisprudence and says he may discuss Louisiana's new embattled Ten Commandments requirement.",
      "\u201cIs it possible I\u2019m going to be suspended?,\" Martin asked in court. \"That\u2019s a real fear.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s newly installed attorney general, Pam Bondi, is going after New York leaders over the state\u2019s immigration policies",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's newly installed attorney general, Pam Bondi, went after New York leaders Wednesday over the state's immigration policies, announcing a lawsuit in the latest effort by the Republican administration to carry out the president's hardline immigration campaign pledges.",
      "In her first press conference since taking office last week, Bondi accused New York leaders of prioritizing \u201cillegal aliens over American citizens.\" Standing in front of federal agents who have been tasked with helping in Trump's immigration crackdown, she echoed the president's rhetoric as she vowed the Justice Department would take on communities that thwart federal immigration efforts.",
      "The lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James and Gov. Kathy Hochul targets a state law that allows people who might not be in the U.S. legally to get driver\u2019s licenses. The so-called Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.",
      "The lawsuit describes the law as \u201ca frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.\" It highlights a provision that requires the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information. The Justice Department is asking the court to strike down the law.",
      "\u201cThis is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans,\u201d said Bondi, with agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration lined up behind her. \u201cMillions of illegal aliens with violent records have flooded into our communities, bringing violence and deadly drugs with them.\u201d",
      "Bondi\u2019s politically charged rhetoric, unusual for an institution that has historically been wary of aligning itself so directly with the White House, and the selection of legal targets raise fresh concerns that she could seek to use the agency\u2019s law enforcement powers to go after the president\u2019s adversaries. James, the New York attorney general, has drawn Trump\u2019s ire by suing him, leading to a civil fraud judgment that stands to cost Trump nearly $500 million.",
      "James said in a statement that she's prepared to defend the state's laws, which she said \u201cprotect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe.\u201d",
      "Hochul said New York welcomes \u201claw-abiding individuals who want to work, pay taxes and contribute to our communities, while at the same time protecting the public safety of all New Yorkers by cracking down on violent criminals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe expect Pam Bondi\u2019s worthless, publicity-driven lawsuit to be a total failure, just like all the others. Let me be clear: New York is not backing down,\u201d the governor said in a statement.",
      "Bondi appeared alongside Tammy Nobles, whose 20-year-old daughter Kayla was killed in Aberdeen, Maryland, in July 2022 by someone from El Salvador who entered the country illegally months earlier in Texas. The assailant, then 16, was released to a first cousin to pursue asylum, which is common practice under U.S. law and policy. He had been accused by authorities in El Salvador of affiliation with the violent MS-13 gang, according to a report by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "To trumpet his immigration policies, Trump has often highlighted \u201cangel moms\u201d like Nobles, who lost their loved ones to violent crimes by people in the country illegally.",
      "\u201cTammy represents not only herself and her family but all of the great angel moms around this country who have suffered because of what the Biden administration did,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s over.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes days after the Justice Department sued the city of Chicago, alleging that its \u201c sanctuary\u201d laws were thwarting federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration sought to pressure New York into changing its law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.",
      "New York\u2019s governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn\u2019t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residency in the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration ultimately restored New Yorkers\u2019 access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.",

      "Lawyers sparred before New York\u2019s top court over how specific a man alleging sexual abuse decades ago needs to be in his lawsuit against the state",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- Lawyers sparred before New York's top court Wednesday over how specific a man alleging sexual abuse decades ago needs to be in his lawsuit against the state in a case that's being watched by advocates concerned about the legal standards for survivors to recall traumatic events.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James' office is seeking dismissal of the lawsuit by a man who says he was repeatedly sexually assaulted around a state-run theater in Albany from 1986 to 1990, starting when he was 12. The suit was filed under a 2019 state law that allows people to sue over sexual abuse they suffered long ago as children.",
      "A state attorney told the Court of Appeals the lawsuit doesn\u2019t adequately specify the nature of the claimed abuse and that its time frame for when the alleged abuse happened is too broad, falling short of standards for suing the state.",
      "The case deals only with requirements for suing New York, not private institutions.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be a specific date, but it should be a very narrow range,\" said Jeffrey Lang of the attorney general's office. \u201cI would say weeks, and here we just have nothing.\u201d",
      "Narrower time frames are needed so the state can investigate claims and assess its liability, Lang said.",
      "James' appeal has worried some supporters of the Child Victims Act, the state law that temporarily lifted barriers to filing civil suits over child sexual abuse beyond typical time limits. They say child abuse victims cannot be expected to consistently recall details of trauma that occurred long ago.",
      "The man's lawyer echoed that argument Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAt the time this claim was filed almost four years ago, this was the extent of the information that he knew because of the psychological trauma,\u201d said attorney Seth Dymond.",
      "The man sued the state in 2021, saying he was repeatedly raped, molested and fondled by multiple men, including state employees, around The Egg, a performing arts theater at the state Capitol complex. The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly.",
      "The lawsuit originally was dismissed by a judge for the Court of Claims who cited the lack of specific dates. A mid-level appeals court reversed that decision in November 2023. The appeals judges found that the since the alleged events occurred several decades ago when the claimant was a child, the multi-year timeframe was specific enough.",
      "The case is among roughly 300 filed against the state during a two-year window under the Child Victims Act. The lion\u2019s share of more than 10,800 lawsuits filed before the window closed in 2021 named private institutions such as churches, hospitals and schools.",
      "The arguments over the man's suit have highlighted tensions between James\u2019 public image as a champion for victims and her legal duty to defend the state against lawsuits.",
      "A spokesperson for the Democratic attorney general said in a prepared statement that survivors of child sexual abuse \u201cdeserve the opportunity to pursue justice through the process outlined in the Child Victims Act. As New York\u2019s lawyer, we have a responsibility to defend the state, which we are balancing with our strong desire to support survivors and their ability to heal.\u201d",
      "James argues the Legislature could have adopted different legal requirements for suing the state when it crafted the law.",
      "Advocates and attorneys for survivors have expressed concern that a win for the state could affect some pending cases filed under the Child Victims Act, as well as cases bought more recently under a companion law that opened a litigation window for people claiming they were abused as adults. The Adult Survivors Act resulted in more than 1,400 lawsuits against the state, most alleging abuse in state prisons.",
      "\u201cThe state basically is saying, \u2018We don\u2019t believe victims. We\u2019re not going to allow these victims have their day in court,\u2019\u201d said Gary Greenberg, an advocate who fought for the Child Victims Act.",
      "Albany Law School professor Dale Margolin Cecka noted that James' primary duty is to defend the state. By appealing to the top court, James is seeking resolution on the standards for suing under the Child Victims Act that are unclear, said Cecka, who represents victims of domestic violence.",
      "\u201cShe can\u2019t go, \u2018Well, this seems so bad to me that we\u2019re just not going to personally advocate for our client,\u2019 which is the state of New York,\u201d Cecka said."

Instead, they went to mid-level medium-security facilities, according to an Associated Press analysis of Illinois Department of Corrections data.",
      "Prison employees believe housing for the transferred inmates was based on which facilities had bed space and sufficient personnel who are adequately trained in a critically understaffed system.",
      "Corrections spokesperson Naomi Puzzello said all of the transfers from Stateville are appropriately housed and that none was reclassified to a lower security level to match that of the receiving prison. She acknowledged scores of maximum-security beds are vacant but said corrections' understaffing played no role in the transfers.",
      "However, the AP obtained minutes from a meeting at a separate facility nearly a year before Stateville's shutdown in which administrators discouraged staff from bumping troublemakers up to a higher risk level because \u201cmaximum security beds are in short supply.\u201d",
      "And the AP found that in more than half of the relocations, ex-Stateville inmates were transferred without regard to a corrections guideline that those serving sentences of 30 years or more be housed in max prisons.",
      "Opened in 1925, Stateville was targeted for closure in the spring when Gov. JB Pritzker set aside $900 million to replace it and Logan Correctional Center, the deteriorating women\u2019s facility in central Illinois. A federal judge, accelerating the plan by declaring Stateville uninhabitable and inaccessible, ordered it shuttered by Sept. 30.",
      "Prison staff shortages are a problem nationally. Wisconsin has seen a spate of inmate deaths while it struggles with vacant posts. \u201cGrossly inadequate\u201d staffing was among problems listed last fall in a searing Justice Department critique of violence, drugs and sexual abuse in Georgia prisons.",
      "Data compiled by the nonprofit Safer Prisons, Safer Communities shows that the number of state-employed corrections officers dropped from 237,000 in 2012 to 182,000 in 2023.",
      "Simply put, it's a tough job, said Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and advocacy group that espouses decarceration.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to witness violence, you might witness serious mental illness,\" Bertram said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be around a lot of drug use and these things have a measurable impact on corrections workers.\u201d",
      "The Illinois Department of Corrections is 396 frontline security officers short of what was budgeted, according to October department staffing numbers. Total current officers are more than 2,800 shy of the authorized headcount, or the number needed to operate without substantial overtime.",
      "Under the Illinois public records law, AP obtained a list of 406 inmates housed at Stateville as of August 2024 and matched each with the prison to which they\u2019d been transferred, noting its security level. Corrections denied a request for the accompanying pre-transfer security levels of each inmate.",
      "Statewide, there are 1,750 currently unoccupied beds in max prisons, Puzzello said. However, the majority are in cells designed for two inmates and most prisoners are in single-occupancy cells, so short staffing isn't to blame, she maintained. The agency continues to vigorously recruit security cadets.",
      "Employees are unconvinced and believe some inmates who qualify for max security have been diverted to less secure places, posing a risk to inmates as well as staff.",
      "Although not part of the latest transfers, an offender moved to Sheridan Correctional Center in north-central Illinois from Stateville in November 2023 viciously attacked a prison educator, who required facial reconstruction surgery, according to the employees' union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31.",
      "There have been at least two suspected homicides of inmates since mid-2024, but corrections denied the AP's public records request for information on them. The news agency is appealing that decision.",
      "High-security bed space appears to have been an issue months before Stateville's shutdown. In minutes obtained by the AP from a December 2023 management meeting at Dixon Correctional Center in northern Illinois, administrators advised staff to \u201cuse good judgment\u201d before upgrading a troublemaker's risk level to maximum, necessitating a transfer.",
      "\u201cMaximum security beds throughout the state are in short supply,\" the minutes say. \"If we try to transfer all the max security individuals, they will more than likely just end up at another medium security facility.\u201d",
      "Puzzello reiterated that none of the Stateville transfers had security downgrades. She said transfers are based not only on criminal background but on programming needs, medical and mental health treatment and staffing ratios at the receiving facility.",
      "\u201cThis ensures each individual\u2019s classification is appropriate and tailored to their specific risk factors, behaviors and needs, supporting a safe and secure correctional environment,\" Puzzello said.",
      "However, a general corrections guideline is that any offender serving a sentence of 30 or more years be housed in a maximum-security cell. Those with 10 to 30 years go to medium, according to the guideline.",
      "Of ex-Stateville inmates, 261 \u2014 or 64% \u2014 locked up for 30 or more years are now sitting in medium-security prisons, according to the AP review.",
      "AFSCME spokesperson Anders Lindall said prison counselors who evaluated each inmate for an appropriate transfer location believed management had already decided where each would go. Puzzello denied that happened.",
      "Lindall said the union received reports of \u201congoing instances of recommendations made at the facility level -- by employees whose job it is to evaluate, classify and place the offenders who they know best \u2014 being overruled by departmental management.\u201d"

      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is suing agencies under President Donald Trump, saying they are illegally and unconstitutionally withholding billions in federal aid from the state that had already been approved by Congress",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Thursday sued agencies under President Donald Trump, saying they are illegally and unconstitutionally withholding billions in federal aid from the state that had already been approved by Congress.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, filed the lawsuit despite the fact that federal courts have repeatedly rejected the Trump administration's sweeping pause on federal funding, and Shapiro's lawyers suggest that the Trump administration is continuing to ignore court orders to restore access to the suspended money.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, calls actions by the federal agencies \u201cflagrantly lawless\u201d and said the agencies have no legal authority to unilaterally refuse to spend congressionally appropriated money over a policy disagreement.",
      "Further, the agencies have provided no plausible explanation for the suspension, Shapiro's lawyers said.",
      "Shapiro, his agencies and members of Congress have tried to try to fully restore access to the money, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cDespite that work, and despite two temporary restraining orders requiring federal agencies to restore access to suspended funds, federal agencies continue to deny Pennsylvania agencies funding that they are entitled to receive,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The federal agencies named as defendants \u2014 the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy, Interior and Transportation \u2014 did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. In the Department of Interior's case, it said its policy is not to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The Trump administration issued a memo in late January freezing federal grants and loans. Administration officials said the pause was necessary to review whether spending aligned with Trump\u2019s executive orders on issues such as climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The freeze caused widespread chaos.",
      "The Trump administration rescinded the memo less than two days later, but money for things such as early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research remained tied up, nearly two dozen Democratic states said in a federal lawsuit.",
      "A judge ordered the administration on Monday to \u201cimmediately take every step necessary\u201d to unfreeze all federal grants and loans, finding that the Trump administration hadn't fully followed his earlier order. The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling and lost Tuesday.",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s case, the Shapiro administration said about $2.5 billion in grants or reimbursements committed to Pennsylvania is now suspended or under some sort of review that hasn\u2019t been approved by Congress or any funding agreement, and hasn\u2019t been explained to Shapiro\u2019s administration.",
      "The lawsuit said aid is being withheld from programs that distribute money to plug abandoned gas wells, improve energy efficiency in homes, upgrade rural electric service and reimburse industry for cutting their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Shapiro's lawyers said the administration cannot legally add new conditions to federal aid after a state has already accepted it, and federal aid cannot be shut off unless it is for a reason that is specifically laid out by the law or a funding agreement between a state and federal agency.",
      "That violates the spending clause of the U.S. Constitution, Shapiro's lawsuit said.",

      "The Arizona Supreme Court has set a March 19 execution date for a man who pleaded guilty to murder more than 17 years ago and has said himself that his lethal injection is long overdue",
      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Supreme Court set a March 19 execution date Tuesday for a man who pleaded guilty to murder more than 17 years ago and recently said his death sentence was \u201clong overdue.\u201d It would be the state\u2019s first application of the death penalty in more than two years.",
      "The court issued an execution warrant for Aaron Brian Gunches, who was convicted in 2007 in the 2002 shooting death of Ted Price, his girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband, near the Phoenix suburb of Mesa.",
      "Gunches also shot a trooper twice when he was pulled over by the Arizona Department of Public Safety near the California border in 2003, according to authorities. A bulletproof vest saved the trooper, and bullet casings from that scene matched ones found near Price\u2019s body.",
      "In a statement, Price\u2019s sister, Karen Price, described her brother as a kind and loving person who enjoyed watching the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Diamondbacks and riding his motorcycle.",
      "Price expressed relief now that the execution warrant has been issued. Her brother\u2019s two children, teenagers at the time of his death, were forever changed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to describe how Ted\u2019s murder has devastated our family,\u201d Price said.",
      "Arizona, which has 112 prisoners on death row, last carried out three executions in 2022 following a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by criticism that a 2014 execution was botched and because of difficulties obtaining drugs for execution. In one of the 2022 executions, the state was criticized for taking too long to insert an IV for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner.",
      "The court had issued a death warrant for Gunches nearly two years ago, but the sentence wasn\u2019t carried out because the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general agreed not to pursue executions during a review of the state\u2019s death penalty protocol. The review ended in November when Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs dismissed the retired federal magistrate judge she had appointed to examine execution procedures.",
      "A spokesman said then that the review resulted in critical improvements to meet legal and constitutional standards, and that the governor \u201cremains committed to upholding the law while ensuring justice is carried out in a way that\u2019s transparent and humane.\u201d",
      "The 53-year-old Gunches, who isn\u2019t a lawyer but is representing himself, had asked the court in late December to skip legal formalities and schedule his lethal injection earlier than authorities had planned, saying his death sentence was \u201clong overdue.\u201d The state Supreme Court rejected his request.",
      "There was no immediate response to phone and email messages seeking comment from Emily Skinner, an attorney who serves as Gunches\u2019 advisory counsel.",

      "Citing \u201cvarious credible sources,\u201d the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 \u2014 the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising.",
      "Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured \u201cwere shot by Bangladesh\u2019s security forces,\u201d the report said.",
      "Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed \u2014- or as many as about 180 people \u2014 were children.",
      "In some cases, \u201csecurity forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,\u201d it said.",
      "U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk cited signs that \u201cextrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture\u201d were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests.",

The officials spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.",

      "The case has drawn national attention as another example of police shooting Black people in their homes. It forced the premature retirement of Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell, who hired Grayson, and prompted an agreement with the Justice Department for more training on non-discriminatory policing, de-escalation techniques and dealing with mental health disabilities.",

Massey apologized and ducked behind a counter. Grayson fired three shots, striking her just below the left eye.",
      "Grayson remains jailed despite a unanimous 4th District Appellate Court ruling in November that his pre-trial detention was improper because prosecutors failed to show there were no conditions under which Grayson could be released without posing a threat to the community.

      "North Carolina House members have advanced a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene by another $500 million",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina House members advanced Wednesday a Republican package to boost state recovery funding after Hurricane Helene as committees fleshed out details on how best to spend another $500 million to address the historic flooding.",
      "The House's budget-writing committee voted for the latest spending proposal, which would emphasize repairs for damaged homes, private bridges and roads, assistance to farmers who lost crops and rebuilding infrastructure adjacent used by small businesses.",
      "GOP House leaders had unveiled a version last week, but several amendments adjusted the measure in a special Helene recovery committee on Tuesday. A House floor vote is expected next week, said Rep. John Bell, the House rules chairman and co-chairman of the recovery committee.",
      "The package remains less than half of the $1.07 billion that new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein sought in new recovery spending earlier this month from legislators.",
      "Stein's package contains several initiatives the House plan currently lacks, including money to recompense local governments in the mountains for lost or spent revenues and for two business grant programs designed to help small businesses directly.",
      "Senate GOP leaders will have their own competing spending ideas that will figure into negotiations with House counterparts. Both Stein and Republican lawmakers want to get more Helene spending out the door early this year to address immediate needs. Additional funds are expected in the two-year state budget that would take effect July 1.",
      "The legislature already has appropriated close to $1 billion since last fall for Helene aid in the weeks after it made landfall in late September.",
      "\u201cThis is just the next step in this process,\u201d House Speaker Destin Hall told Tuesday's committee meeting. \"Somebody asked me earlier, \u2018How many bills are we going to need to do this?\u2019 And my answer is \u2014 and I know you all feel the same \u2014 it\u2019s going to be as many as it takes for us to get it done to rebuild western North Carolina.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported that Helene damaged 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads, bridges and culverts. State officials projected the storm caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs.",
      "Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "The state House proposal seeks to maximize federal matching funds, avoid mistakes from previous storm recovery efforts and prevent the distribution of too much money to programs ill-equipped to get it out the door, Bell said.",
      "\"This body is very strategic in what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Bell said Wednesday.",
      "Adjustments that House Republicans made this week to their preliminary bill included shifting $75 million to create a state Agriculture Department program to address agricultural crop and infrastructure losses.",
      "Another $60 million initially earmarked for repairs of state facilities would be used for other purposes. Nearly all of it \u2014 $55 million \u2014 would help small businesses, although not in the form of direct payments, as Stein and other Democrats want.",
      "Instead, the proposed infrastructure grant program would allocate money to local governments to repair \u201cqualifying infrastructure needs\u201d like utilities, broadband and sidewalks that would benefit small businesses trying to reemerge from the storm. Bell said Wednesday that a grant program could be open to abuses by businesses that aren't located specifically in the damaged region.",
      "With Republicans falling one seat short of retaining a veto-proof majority in the General Assembly after the November election, Stein and Democratic allies may be able to yield more leverage to fashion a package to their liking.",
      "For example, Democratic Rep. Eric Ager of Buncombe County offered an amendment Tuesday to create a direct payment program to small businesses that Stein sought, running it through the state Revenue Department.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing businesses in western North Carolina every day and we\u2019ve got to find a solution,\u201d Ager said, adding that it \u201cwould really go a long way in keeping some folks solvent through to the summer when business picks back up again.\u201d",
      "While Ager pulled his amendment before a vote because earlier committee action took away his funding source, Bell suggested to Ager and later to reporters that new language to help small businesses may be considered."

      "Hyde died on Monday at her Raleigh home following a period of declining health, family member Tom Hendrickson said Wednesday.",

      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which tracks inflation before it reaches consumers \u2014 rose 0.4% from December and 3.5% from January 2024. Forecasters had expected a 0.2% change month over month and 3.2% year over year.",

      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation flared up in early 2021 as the economy rebounded with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, overwhelming factories, ports and freight yards and leading to shortages, delays and higher prices.",
      "In response, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate \u2014 the fed funds rate \u2014 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation began tumbling \u2014 from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022 to a low of 2.4% in September, tantalizingly close to the central bank's 2% target. The Fed was satisfied enough to reverse course and cut its rate three times in the last four months of 2024.",
      "Then the improvement on inflation stopped. Year-over-year consumer price inflation has now risen for four straight months.",
      "And economists and financial markets are worried that President Donald Trump's policies will push inflation higher yet. His tariffs on foreign goods and plans to deport millions of undocumented workers could translate into higher prices.",
      "In response to stubborn inflation, the Fed may hold off on further rate cuts. Back in December, it signaled that it expected to cut two more times in 2025. That seems far less likely now. Wall Street investors anticipate only rate cut this year and don't expect that one until October."

      "Baltimore is suing Glock over design features that allow its handguns to be easily modified to become fully automatic weapons",
      "BALTIMORE -- Baltimore is suing gunmaker Glock over design features that allow its handguns to be easily modified to become fully automatic weapons, which enables criminals to inflict more damage and makes the city more dangerous, attorneys argue in a complaint filed Wednesday.",
      "The lawsuit follows similar cases brought against Glock in Chicago, Minnesota and New Jersey. They accuse the company of failing to protect the public by selling firearms that can be adapted with dime-sized switches to spray continuous gunfire \u2014 up to 1,200 rounds per minute \u2014 instead of firing one bullet each time the trigger is pulled.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s faster than the weapons of war that I used in the Army,\u201d Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said during a news conference Wednesday morning announcing it. \u201cATF agents call it \u2018spray and pray\u2019 because once the trigger is pulled, there\u2019s no control \u2014 only carnage.\u201d",
      "The state of Maryland joined the city of Baltimore as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.",
      "Often referred to as Glock switches or auto sears, the conversion devices can be bought for about $20 or 3D-printed. They\u2019ve received heightened attention in recent years because they\u2019re increasingly turning up at crime scenes.",
      "Glock isn\u2019t the only gunmaker whose weapons can be adapted with switches, but critics say its handguns are among the easiest to convert. With rare exceptions, federal law prohibits the sale and possession of machine guns.",
      "\u201cGlock could have designed its pistols to prevent auto sears from working. They chose not to. That choice cost lives,\u201d Brown said.",
      "Glock didn\u2019t respond to a Wednesday email seeking comment, and it hasn\u2019t responded to previous AP requests for comment on lawsuits over the switches. But a gun industry group has condemned the New Jersey and Minnesota lawsuits as frivolous claims that abuse the judicial system and disregard federal law.",
      "A report last year by the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety said modified Glocks are often used in crimes. And the company has long been aware that easy conversion is a selling point, said Eric Tirschwell, executive director of Everytown Law, which represents the plaintiffs in the Maryland lawsuit.",
      "The brand is perhaps best known for its popularity among law enforcement officers, who almost exclusively carry Glock handguns. But Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley said the recent proliferation of Glock switches means his officers increasingly find themselves \u201coutmatched by criminals.\u201d",
      "Baltimore police recovered 65 modified Glocks in 2024, compared to 35 the previous year, officials said. Roughly half the people arrested with modified Glocks since the beginning of 2023 were under 21 years old, according to the suit. The complaint alleges that Glock switches are adding to a culture of violence among young men across Baltimore.",
      "Filed in state court in Baltimore, the lawsuit accuses Glock of violating Maryland\u2019s public nuisance laws. It seeks an injunction preventing the sale of certain firearms in Maryland, a court order demanding safety measures and restitution payments that could contribute to anti-violence programs.",
      "The Maryland General Assembly passed a law last year allowing for civil action against members of the firearm industry who fail to meet minimum standards to prevent harm. Another bill banned the conversion devices.",
      "Baltimore leaders also sued the ghost gun manufacturer Polymer80, which agreed to stop selling its untraceable, unassembled firearms to Maryland residents under a settlement announced last year. The Nevada-based company later shut down after facing a deluge of lawsuits.",
      "Baltimore has recently experienced significant reductions in gun violence that experts attribute to robust anti-violence programs, improvements in policing and pandemic recovery, among other factors. But Mayor Brandon Scott said his administration is \u201cmobilizing every resource at our disposal\u201d to continue those positive trends, including civil litigation."

      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",

      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",

      "The UK government has given its strongest signal yet that it will seek exemptions from tariffs being threatened on British steel entering the US.",
      "US President Donald Trump has announced 25% taxes on steel entering the country, meaning American businesses face having to pay more to import the metal.",
      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the UK had a strong case to avoid the border taxes, given the amounts Britain exported to the US were small in comparison to other countries and because the steel was used in areas such as defence.",
      "Trump has previously said the tariffs will be enforced on 12 March \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "The government has said it would not retaliate immediately to new measures announced this week, despite many in the steel industry calling on Britain to join the European Union and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Reynolds acknowledged there was a global oversupply of steel and aluminium but said he would argue to the Trump administration that the UK was not the problem.",
      "His comments also suggested that the UK would be reluctant to join potential retaliation by the EU to any further tariffs imposed by the US, adding that \"the UK national interest was best served by free trade\".",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods from overseas, not by the foreign companies selling the products.",
      "There are concerns that the measures could lead to a rise in inflation if the company buying the goods passes on the cost of the tariff by charging their customers more.",
      "In some cases, the company could decide to absorb the costs themselves, or simply to reduce imports, which would hit foreign exporters - and in the UK's case, British steelmakers exporting to the US.",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "The threat of trade tariffs has been noted to have created uncertainty for UK businesses, which are set to be hit by higher taxes from April.",
      "Reynolds conceded that tax rises on businesses announced in Budget had been \"challenging\" for firms of whom the government was \"asking a lot\".",
      "Appearing before a gathering of business leaders near Kings Cross, Reynolds announced new guidance for the competition watchdog to be more agile, speedy, and less risk averse.",
      "The meeting came after the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority [CMA] was recently forced out by ministers over concerns it had not been sufficiently focused on economic growth.",

      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",
      "The initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",

      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",

      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",

The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",

      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",
      "The bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.",
      "A compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.",
      "Reeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.",
      "She then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.",
      "The MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",

      "In November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.",
      "The prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.",
      "The spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".",
      "\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Two major lenders launched mortgage deals on Thursday with interest rates of less than 4%, as competition picks up in the sector.",
      "The prospect of further cuts in the base rate by the Bank of England has given mortgage providers confidence to reduce their own rates.",
      "But the attention-grabbing sub-4% deals by Santander and Barclays will not be available to all borrowers, particularly first-time buyers, and may come with a hefty fee.",
      "The return of such deals might prompt other lenders to follow suit after a period of tepid competition.",

      "Mortgage deals with interest rates below 4% have not been seen since November.",

      "\"If your mortgage is coming up for renewal soon and you have already selected a new deal, it is a good time to review it and potentially swap to a better rate.\"",
      "Time to decide",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move fairly closely in line with the Bank's base rate, which was cut to 4.5% a week ago. However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals.",
      "The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "That means a higher monthly bill for many homeowners on their next renewal, but there are signs that the rate they could pay is on its way down.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the interest-rate setting committee expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\".",

      "When will interest rates go down again?",

      "\"This is a positive injection to the mortgage market and when a big lender makes such a move, it can prompt its peers to follow suit with cuts of their own.",
      "\"The millions of mortgage borrowers looking to refinance this year need some good news.\"",
      "Read the small print",
      "Eligible borrowers for the sub-4% rates will need a 40% deposit, which will shut off these deals to many borrowers, especially some first-time buyers.",
      "They may also have a relatively large fee, so borrowers will need to check whether the overall value works for them.",
      "More demand for homes from buyers could be generated if mortgage rates fall for a prolonged period.",
      "In its latest survey, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said that housing market activity was expected to pick up over the coming months following a flat start to the year.",

      "Minutes after take off, an explosion on board Avianca flight 203 killed the 107 passengers and crew, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris.",
      "The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel.",
      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",

      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",

      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",

      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",

      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",

      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",

      "But some analysts said after the report that they were no longer expecting any rate cuts this year.",

      "Heathrow Airport chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he wants planes to take off from its new third runway before the end of the next parliament, which could be ten years or fewer.",
      "The plans, which will be paid for with private cash, come after Chancellor Rachel Reeves backed a third runway at the UK's largest airport last month as part of efforts to grow the UK economy.",
      "Reeves' decision to back Heathrow's expansion has angered campaigners and members of her party who oppose it on environmental grounds.",
      "During his speech at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, Mr Woldbye signed a pact to use UK steel to build new infrastructure.",
      "He also revealed funding to increase capacity at terminals two and five, and plans to reconfigure the airfield and improve bus connections.",
      "The commitment to use UK-made steel comes amid concern in the industry over the impact of tariffs being placed on imports of the metal to the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "The US import taxes could lead to excess steel being offloaded to the UK at cheaper prices, with the potential to undercut domestic businesses.",
      "While the detailed plans for a third runway at the UK's largest airport, are yet to be finalised, the construction of terminal five, which opened in 2008, required some 80,000 tonnes of steel.",
      "The expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial and faces opposition from environmental groups, many politicians, as well as nearby local authorities and residents.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "\"A third runway at Heathrow can not be a choice between economic growth and the environment,\" Mr Woldbye said.",
      "He added that it was a \"collective mission\" to grow Heathrow \"responsibly within environmental boundaries.\"",
      "The aviation industry is a source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and it's already under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr Woldbye outlined the expansion plan ahead of the new runway, which will see upgrades to terminal buildings to \"enhance passenger experience and improve resilience and sustainability\".",
      "\"This privately funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year,\" he said.",
      "The chancellor has said expansion at Heathrow is \"badly needed\" and could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "Zengwei An, chief executive of British Steel - which has the only facility in the country to make primary steel - said its workers in Scunthorpe and Teeside had a \"distinguished history of supplying world-class products into projects like Heathrow's expansion\".",
      "Gareth Stace, director-general of the steel industry body UK Steel, added that Heathrow committing to using domestically-made steel was a \"major vote of confidence in UK steelmaking and British businesses full stop\".",
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built in 10 years, Reeves says",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building it could take about seven years.",
      "Reeves has said she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" before 2029 and planes to start using the runway by 2035, but Mr Woldbye has previously warned the project would take years and need \"Churchillian resolve\" to deliver.",
      "In his speech, the Heathrow boss said the airport's expansion plans will be carried out with \"strict environmental safeguards\"",
      "\"This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon... it's as simple as that,\" he added.",
      "\"I want to assure you that we are committed to listening and working with our local communities to provide them with the certainty they deserve, ending years of doubt.\"",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and provides a key avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is strained: last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit. A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000."

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the move would trigger \"firm and proportionate countermeasures\" while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also pledged to \"stand up for\" Canadian workers and businesses.",
      "The comments came after the US president ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US, ending previous exemptions for allies including Canada and the EU and marking a major expansion of trade barriers.",
      "Trump said he was \"simplifying\" the rules and the measures would boost domestic production.",
      "\"This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,\" Trump said, signing the proclamation, which said the measures would come into force on 12 March.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminium to be made in America, not in foreign lands,\" he added.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers.",
      "Canada alone accounted for more than 50% of aluminium imported into the US last year.",
      "The tariffs will raise the cost of bringing the metals into the US, sparking concern among businesses in the US that rely on the imports and many world leaders because it will make it more expensive for companies to sell their products in the world's largest economy.",
      "If the tariffs come into force as outlined, they are expected to have the most significant impact on Canada.",
      "Trudeau called the threatened tariffs \"unacceptable\" and he hoped talks with the Trump administration would resolve the issue without the need for dollar-for-dollar retaliation.",

      "\"This is sort of a replay of 2018,\" said Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "\"The biggest question is the uncertainty over whether this is a bargaining tactic or whether he just doesn't want to talk with other countries and really wants to help out the steel industry in that way.\"",
      "Last week, Trump ordered import duties of 25% on all Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay that plan for 30 days. He also brought in new US levies of 10% on all Chinese goods coming into the US, prompting retaliation from China.",

      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",

      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",

      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",

      "When she and five-year-old Aziyah moved into their home in Brighton in 2020, it seemed in good condition. But black mould quickly began to appear. Over the next two years it spread all over the walls, even onto the beds and furniture.",
      "The 25-year-old, who privately rents for \u00a31,100 a month, initially reported it to her landlord, but despite their attempt to improve ventilation, the problem remained. A year later, Aziyah began to develop health issues and was later diagnosed with asthma.",

      "After two-year-old Awaab Ishak's death in 2020 was found to have been directly linked to mould exposure, the then-Conservative government drew up a new law in his name to protect social tenants in England from unsafe living conditions. But the legislation is yet to come into effect.",
      "The government announced the law will be enforced for damp and mould problems from October - and fully implemented for all other hazards by 2027. Private renters will be protected in the same way - says the government - once its Renters' Rights Bill becomes law, expected later this year.",
      "In Awaab's case, his father Faisal had repeatedly raised the mould problem with the housing association responsible for the family's Rochdale flat, but no action was taken.",

      "After she complained to the council - which is responsible for ensuring landlords maintain housing standards - the landlord installed extractor fans and provided dehumidifiers. But the mould remained.",
      "In many cases, local authorities are not enforcing private landlords' legal duty to maintain safe housing.",
      "We asked every local authority in England and Wales for the number of complaints they had received about housing issues and what enforcement action they had taken. In the past seven years, there were more than 570,000 complaints (from 255 council responses, after 317 requests) about privately rented homes.",
      "In more than 90% of cases, no action was taken and fewer than 1% of complaints resulted in a landlord being prosecuted.",
      "Councils are facing significant ongoing and historic challenges with resourcing, says the Local Government Association that speaks for authorities in England and Wales. \"Issues may be resolved without the need for inspection, with enforcement and prosecution being a last resort when all other options fail,\" it adds.",
      "Over the past 10 years, council funding in England has gone down by 10% in real terms, according to the National Audit Office.",
      "\"There is a perfect storm now happening, some of which is around really stretched funding, some of which is around the age of homes,\" England's Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway says.",
      "In England alone, more than three million households are estimated to be living in properties that do not meet the government's decent homes standard, according to a government survey.",
      "The homes are either in a state of disrepair, do not have modern kitchen and bathroom facilities, or lack adequate heating and insulation.",

      "The couple say they first told their managing agent, Savills, about the problems in 2022.",
      "Savills says it authorised work for the house, including having the roof resurfaced in 2023 - but water is still getting in, including from the adjoining property, and many other problems remain.",
      "BBC Panorama wanted to find out who was ultimately responsible for the condition of the home.",

      "One of them, Mark Pears, is also on the 2024 Sunday Times rich list, with an estimated family wealth of more than \u00a33bn. He is also a trustee of the British Museum. His brother and fellow director Sir Trevor Pears was knighted in 2017 for his charity work.",
      "Area Estates told us it had authorised professional managing agents \"to look after the [Rotherham] property in accordance with all regulations\", and to \"carry out day-to-day maintenance\", and that requests for more expensive repairs were always responded to quickly.",
      "\"The managing agents will reinspect the house shortly and attend to any repair issues found which are the landlord's responsibility,\" it added.",
      "Managing agent Savills said it was \"very sorry to learn that Mrs Brown believes that complaints have been in any way ignored\". It said it had always attempted to address any problems in a timely manner - and had completed 13 different inspection and repair works at the property between 2023 and 2024.",
      "When BBC Panorama told the couple about the identity of their landlord, Christine said: \"I'd shake his hand and I'd say, 'please make my house safe'.\"",
      "Since Area Estates was contacted, Savills has arranged for new windows to be fitted and the house to be redecorated. The agent says all remedial works have now been completed with the \"exception of an outstanding matter regarding a 'lean to' building, erected by the tenant, to which further works may be required to make it water tight\".",
      "In Sinead's case, while council environmental health officers said there were problems, they concluded the flat was safe. She then secured legal aid to pay for an independent inspection. It said the flat was \"unfit for human habitation\".",
      "Sinead also applied for social housing, submitting evidence about Aziyah's health. But the council said he had not had \"frequent A&E visits with hospital admissions and complex treatment\".",
      "Brighton and Hove City Council says the issues it has the legal power to enforce at Sinead's flat have now been addressed by the private landlord. It says it has also recommended improvements to \"ventilation and insulation\" that it \"can encourage but cannot enforce\".",
      "Sinead's landlord accepts that \"there is a problem with condensation\" but says the continuing issues are \"due to neglect\" by her not clearing away condensation.",
      "Keeping a consistent temperature and ventilation can help prevent mould growth - but it will not solve the problem if faults with the building mean there is poor ventilation or damp is coming in.",

    "title": "Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",

    "title": "Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",

      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

      "David Boutflour's background is as far from the glamour of space launches as it's possible to imagine.",
      "The 31-year-old worked in hospitality for nine years, becoming the general manager for a gastro-pub in Cheshire. But it wasn't the real career for him. \"I felt I could do more,\" he says.",
      "Mr Boutflour had been interested in space and aviation from a young age, mentioning Concorde as an early inspiration.",
      "A course at Portsmouth University caught his imagination - the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship launched in conjunction with BAE Systems.",
      "To build up funds to help pay for the course, he switched to lorry driving - a move which did not prepare his social circle for his change of direction.",
      "\"Everybody thought I was lying when I said I'd been accepted on this course. They thought I was pulling their leg, going from truck driver to space engineer!\"",
      "The four-and-a-half year course involves on-the-job learning at sites where BAE Systems designs and assembles satellites.",
      "Back at Portsmouth they'll be studying space systems engineering.",
      "The academic side of the course consists of four modules, in thermodynamics, programming, digital systems and maths, all split between lectures and laboratory time.",
      "Mr Boutflour is joined by four others on the paid apprenticeship.",
      "One of those is Alice Overend.",
      "Aged 21, she had already worked on satellite assembly and testing when she applied for the Portsmouth course.",
      "This work involved the ill-fated Prometheus 2 satellites that were lost during a failed attempt to launch a satellite into space by Virgin Orbit in 2023.",
      "This incident made a deep impression on her. \"It was quite surreal, we were all watching the launch in the office and when the coverage ended we just went home.\"",
      "Unsuccessful satellite launches are part of life in the space business. But the Virgin Orbit loss stuck in the mind of other Portsmouth students. It stands for the risk element in space work.",
      "Ms Overend's background in satellite testing has given her a head-start in terms of understanding how a sprawling UK space industry fits together. \"The whole space sector is going in a good direction.\"",
      "She explains the true meaning of \"space systems\" in her world.",
      "\"Systems is about making sure everything is where it should be, such as the satellite weight being precisely right.\"",
      "George Smith is the youngest of the group at 18, and joined the course straight from A levels in physics, maths and engineering.",
      "In his home town of York he and some friends took apart an old lawn mower to build a go-kart out of the parts.",
      "How did the go-kart perform? \"It only wanted to turn to the right, but we learnt a lot about why it wasn't working.\"",
      "Not everything in space exploration goes to plan either, but practical work like this is an integral part of the course.",
      "\"The apprenticeship appealed to me. I find studying and applying the lesson in practice means I learn better. So I was looking at degree apprenticeships and this course was a checklist of everything I wanted to do.\"",
      "Space is an expanding sector and he harbours a desire to get beyond earth's atmosphere one day \"if I can tick all the right boxes to become an astronaut\".",
      "Right now the course is meeting his expectations. \"To say it's a dream come true is cheesy, but I've got in the door.\"",
      "Elizabeth Seward is the head of space strategy at BAE Systems.",
      "Despite her own background as a physicist, Ms Seward thinks people are put off this sector by a perception that it's exclusively for rocket scientists.",
      "\"Space tends to get put on a pedestal. But the truth is we need more people from other backgrounds. A career here is for anyone interested in space, such as project managers or lawyers.\"",
      "The appeal of space is evident at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, where Dr Stephanie Docherty teaches orbital mechanics, how a satellite gets on the right path, as part of the aerospace course.",

      "\"Most of us play video games,\" says Mr Smith, with Ms Overend nodding in agreement.",

      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",
      "Schools have told the BBC it is not clear how these priorities will be agreed or by whom. The council subsequently said schools would be consulted.",
      "Contract makes school pay thousands to cut grass",
      "Cold and leaky school 'causing pupils stress'",
      "Investors make \u00a3140m from PFI deals",
      "When something isn't fixed quickly, or part of a school is out of use, these maintenance contracts allow for money to be held back from the private contractor. In this contract, Stoke-on-Trent City Council is responsible for making sure that happens.",
      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

      "And the issues are not just limited to England and Wales. Queen's University Belfast has faced criticism this week over its decision to open a campus in India while planning to cut up to 270 jobs.",
      "The government says it is \"committed to fixing the foundations of higher education\", while Universities UK, which represents 141 universities, says the sector has been \"doing more with less for years\".",

      "'It feels like you're running into a wall'",
      "In January, the University of Kent said more jobs would be cut in a bid to save nearly \u00a320m.",

      "Lily, from Hong Kong, says her mum \"sacrifices\" to pay for her to go to university as she is not entitled to a student loan and lives on about \u00a350 per week.",

      "They say any voluntary staff departure \"would be considered in relation to the likely workload impact and opportunities to reduce workload\".",
      "How did we get here?",
      "After the freeze on fees, universities say finances have been getting tighter for years.",
      "Then there was the shock of new visa restrictions on international postgraduates coming to the UK bringing their partners and children.",
      "International students pay higher fees, but the introduction of those restrictions in January 2024 has led to a drop of around 16% in applications.",
      "That, in turn, has led to more competition between universities to secure places for UK students.",
      "The body which regulates higher education in England, the Office for Students (OfS), has warned that without change on a scale not seen before, 72% of universities could slide into financial deficit - where a university spends more than it is bringing in - by 2026.",
      "\"We have called for universities and colleges to take bold, transformative steps to address the challenges, and we know that many are taking action already,\" an OfS spokesperson said.",
      "It is also nearly impossible to tell if a university will go bust.",
      "That is because universities borrow money from banks based on the value of the assets they own, like buildings and land. If they get into financial trouble, they will renegotiate the terms of their loan with the bank - and no bank wants to see a university which owes them money failing financially.",
      "The Department for Education says the government inherited a \"dire economic situation\" and has taken \"tough decisions to bolster universities' financial sustainability\".",

      "The previous official record of 58,000 complaints concerned Piers Morgan's comments about Meghan Markle made on Good Morning Britain in 2021. ITV was ultimately cleared by Ofcom, which rejected the complaints.",
      "The Good Law Project argues that GB News violated Ofcom's code, which states broadcasters must protect the public from harmful and offensive material.",

    "summary": "The comedian says \"repeated disruptions\" by two audience members made it \"impossible\" to carry on.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Kay has said he had \"no choice\" but to ask security to eject two hecklers at his show on Saturday because their \"repeated disruptions\" made it \"impossible to continue\".",
      "The comedian asked staff at Manchester's AO Arena to remove a man who shouted \"Garlic bread\", his Phoenix Nights catchphrase, before telling them to throw out a woman who kept calling his name.",
      "The man told the Daily Mail he was \"treated like a terrorist\", while the woman, who Kay called Lisa Riley because of her resemblance to the actress, told the Manchester Evening News she was \"annoyed and upset\".",
      "Kay said they had been \"disrupting from the very start\" and he \"did my best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately, their interruptions continued\".",
      "He explained: \"I then tried to ignore them, hoping they'd settle down, but when the disruption persisted into the second half of the show, I asked the audience around them if they were being bothered by the noise. They all shouted 'yes,' and when I asked for a show of hands, at least 40 people raised theirs.",
      "\"At that point, I had no choice but to take action.",
      "\"The lady who was escorted out did bear a striking resemblance to Lisa Riley, though I don't see how that's an insult.\"",
      "He said he had only kicked out one other person in the previous 114 shows of his three-year tour.",
      "\"As a comedian, you never want to eject anyone, but when repeated disruptions make it impossible to continue, it's important to consider the experience of the rest of the audience, who've paid to see a show without interruption,\" he said.",
      "'Garlic dead'",
      "A video of the incident published by the Sun showed Kay making jokes at the first heckler's expense before taunting him as security stepped in. The comedian declared the man \"garlic dead\" and pulled up a chair to watch him being ejected.",
      "When the woman started shouting Kay's name and \"We love you, Peter\", he asked the audience \"Is she a nightmare?\" before calling on security staff to evict her too. \"Go on, Lisa Riley,\" he told her.",
      "The woman told the Manchester Evening News that was a dig at her weight because Riley \"has lost a lot of weight and looks great but she used to be a bit bigger\".",
      "\"I'm self-conscious about that so to go to a show and feel like you're having the mick taken out of you because of your weight, I was just a bit shocked,\" she said.",
      "On social media, one user who said they were at the show said they had \"lost a lot of respect\" for Kay after the way he treated the hecklers.",
      "However, another fan wrote that \"people were cheering him for throwing out the heckler\" and \"it had to be done\".",
      "Another audience member replied to his statement: \"I think everyone who was there will agree you did nothing wrong! It was a fantastic show and we loved it!\"",

    "summary": "The author says he felt like he was lying in \"a lake of blood\" after he was attacked on stage in New York state.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Salman Rushdie has told a court that he thought he was dying after being stabbed repeatedly on stage two years ago, leaving him blind in one eye.",
      "The renowned British-Indian author gave evidence at the trial of his alleged attacker, 27-year-old Hadi Matar, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and attempted murder.",
      "Proceedings are taking place at a New York state court a few miles from where Sir Salman was attacked on 12 August 2022 as he was about to give a talk on how the US was a haven for exiled writers.",
      "The attack occurred after Sir Salman spent years in hiding because of threats to his life after his novel The Satanic Verses was published in 1988.",
      "Warning: This story contains distressing details",
      "Prosecutors, who have not specified a motive for the stabbing, called Sir Salman to the stand as the first witness on Tuesday morning, asking him to recall the moments before and after the attack.",
      "The 77-year-old told the jury that on the day in question, he had been sitting on stage ready to address an audience at the prestigious Chautauqua Institution.",
      "It was shortly after Sir Salman was introduced that he said he noticed a person rushing at him from his right-hand side.",
      "He described the attacker as wearing dark clothes and a face mask, and said he was struck by the individual's eyes, \"which were dark and seemed very ferocious\".",
      "Sir Salman said he felt the first blow to his right jaw and neck, and thought at first that he had been punched. Then he saw blood pouring on to his clothes.",
      "\"At that point he was hitting me repeatedly, stabbing and slashing,\" the author said, adding that the incident unfolded in a matter of seconds.",
      "Salman Rushdie: Losing an eye upsets me every day",
      "Salman Rushdie: Losing an eye upsets me every day",
      "Sir Salman told the court he was struck a total of 15 times, with wounds to his eye, cheek, neck, chest, torso and thigh.",
      "His left hand was also stabbed when he attempted to defend himself.",
      "The knife wound to his eye was the most painful, he said.",
      "At one point, he took off his glasses, which concealed his right eye with a dark lens, to reveal the extent of the injury.",
      "\"As you can see, that is what is left of it,\" he told the jury. \"There's no vision in the eye at all.\"",
      "As Sir Salman, who wore a dark suit, delivered his testimony, Mr Matar often had his head down, with the two never appearing to make eye contact.",
      "Sir Salman's wife, Lady Rushdie, cried from her seat in the second row as her husband recounted the incident.",
      "He has been worried about his safety since the publication of The Satanic Verses, his surrealist, postmodern novel that was inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad.",
      "While it met acclaim and awards in the Western world, many Muslims considered it blasphemous and some countries banned it. Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa calling for the author's death due to the book.",
      "That fatwa - a religious decree - caused Sir Salman to face countless death threats. He was forced into hiding for nine years and only began travelling again when Iran said it would not enforce the law.",
      "Two weeks before the attack, the author had told a German magazine that he was living a \"relatively normal\" life as the threats had diminished.",
      "But the attack on Sir Salman in Chautauqua, New York, shattered that feeling of safety.",
      "The writer told the court on Tuesday that in the moments afterwards, \"it occurred to me quite clearly that I was dying - that was my predominant thought\".",
      "He also described feeling like he was lying in \"a lake of blood\".",
      "He recalled how bystanders, including members of the audience, subdued the attacker.",
      "\"And thanks to that, I survived,\" Sir Salman said.",
      "The author told the jury he was airlifted to a trauma centre, where he received treatment for his injuries for 17 days.",
      "Mr Matar was arrested at the scene.",
      "The suspect's lawyer, Lynn Schaffer, cross-examined Sir Salman and asked him about whether he could trust his recollection of events given the trauma he endured.",
      "The author responded that trauma can alter people's memory, but added he was certain that he had been wounded 15 times.",
      "\"Afterwards I could see [the wounds] on my body,\" he said. \"I didn't need to be told by anybody.\"",
      "Asked if he had ever had any contact with the suspect before the attack, Sir Salman replied that he had not. He also said the attacker did not say anything to him.",
      "More witnesses are expected to be called to the stand in the coming days, including the surgeon that operated on Sir Salman, as well as law enforcement officers who responded to the attack.",

    "story": [
      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",

    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:14:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The first K-pop boy band with North Korean members aims to debut in the US later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "summary": "Conclave stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, and is leading the nominations in the BAFTAs on Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "As a young boy, film editor Nick Emerson's fascination with 1970s American political thrillers, and watching the unfolding peace talks in Northern Ireland, set him on a path that would lead to him working on one of the most acclaimed films of last year.",
      "Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, is leading this year's Bafta nominations, receiving nods in 12 categories, including Best Editing.",
      "The film is also thought to be a strong contender for the best picture award at next month's Oscars, and several of its stars, and Emerson, could also be in contention for individual prizes.",
      "Growing up in Lisburn, County Antrim, Emerson told BBC News NI that the talks which brought about the Good Friday Agreement gave him an appetite for this depiction of the election of a new pope, and the skills to put it together.",
      "\"Working in the BBC newsroom at the start of my career was a really exciting place to be,\" he said.",
      "\"There were a lot of peace talks and a lot of news.\"",
      "He describes Conclave - which follows a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals as they select the new Pope - in similar terms.",
      "\"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on... people with competing interests and competing ideologies.\"",
      "Emerson moved through the media industry, inspired by his experience in the BBC Newsroom in Belfast.",
      "\"I found myself doing factual TV and now feature films. Its the process, that's the joy of it for me.\"",
      "Conclave opens with the death of the Pope, prompting cardinals to gather in Rome to select a new head of the Catholic Church.",
      "But it comes with all the skullduggery, wheeling and dealing, and conspiracy one would expect, as the frontrunners try to improve their chances of becoming the Vicar of Christ.",

      "It's not the first time a papal conclave has been depicted on screen, and though the real world process is shrouded in mystery, there has been a number of notable attempts to dramatise what goes on.",
      "'Crisis of faith'",
      "Emerson told BBC News that he and Edward Berger - the acclaimed German-Austrian film-maker whose 2022 adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front was nominated for nine Academy Awards - aspired to make something that would replicate the 70s thrillers they grew up on.",
      "\"Edward and I are big fans of films like All The President's Men and we both thought: 'Wouldn't it be great to aspire to something like that?'",

      "\"He's having a personal crisis of faith as he does this,\" Emerson said.",
      "Emerson and Berger's Conclave has pacing and visual storytelling that have been lauded for the way they create suspense and intrigue, as the camera often holds on a subject slightly longer than expected.",
      "Emerson said: \"In our approach Edward was really keen to push boundaries on how long we could hold shots and maintain rigour but also keep an eye on the pace.",

      "Kendrick Lamar's show-stopping performance at Super Bowl on Sunday was, for many, a victory lap following his knock-out blow in a long-running beef with fellow rapper Drake.",
      "The Compton star's entire half-time set seemed to swiftly build to a performance of Not Like Us, his Grammy-winning takedown of Drake which was one of last year's biggest hits... but is also now the subject of a potential libel case brought by the Canadian.",
      "Drake was performing in Australia on Sunday, dishing out cash to several of his fans at a Melbourne show, before the whole world tuned in to watch his rival.",
      "The origins of the argument go back more than decade. But here's a quick reminder of where we are now and how we got here over a heated 12 months:",
      "'The big three'",
      "In March last year, producer and former Drake collaborator Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.",
      "Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.",
      "In it, Lamar took aim at rapper J Cole's previous claim - that himself, Kendrick and Drake were \"the big three\" - proclaiming: \"[forget] the big three - it's just big me\".",
      "After years of tension, the fuse had been lit.",
      "Three become two",
      "Soon after, Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse at a concert in Florida.",
      "He told the crowd: \"I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"",
      "Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".",
      "Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.",
      "Boiling point",
      "Drake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.",
      "\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.",
      "He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.",
      "More rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.",
      "The Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.",

      "\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"",
      "Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.",
      "In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.",
      "\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"",
      "Families embroiled",
      "In May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.",
      "On the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).",
      "Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".",
      "Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.",
      "Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.",
      "Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".",
      "But the Californian wasn't finished and he dropped a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.",
      "\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" he rapped.",
      "Drake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof.",

      "At one star-studded gig in Los Angeles in June, which was intended as a show of unity for the West Coast rap fraternity, Lamar played his biggest diss track five times.",
      "Drake sues record label",
      "Fast forward to January this year, and Drake decided to sue the Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us.",

      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",

      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",
      "Known as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.",

      "\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.",
      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",

    "summary": "Spending on the NHS has been going up for decades and is set to rise further. BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",
      "And maybe instead of spending your money on the latest immune-boosting craze, she suggests thinking about ways of not getting infected in the first place so \"be careful who you socialise with\".",

    "title": "Questions raised over Rachel Reeves's CV and expenses",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:56:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC has established the Chancellor left the Bank of England nine months earlier than she states in her LinkedIn profile.",
    "story": [
      "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the chancellor's online CV, and the use of expenses while working at a bank, in the wake of a BBC News investigation.",
      "Rachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.",
      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",
      "The initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "BBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP",
      "In a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.",
      "The prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".",
      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Reeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006",
      "The rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.",
      "A photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.",
      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",
      "The bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.",
      "A compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.",
      "Reeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.",
      "She then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.",
      "The MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank but she instead held a management role in the bank's Customer Relations department, which dealt with complaints.",
      "In November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.",
      "The prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.",
      "The spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".",
      "\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.",

    "summary": "BBC News has learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Rachel Reeves, and two other senior managers, when she worked at HBOS.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves has had a difficult start to her ministerial career.",
      "As well as Labour's new chancellor taking on the challenges of the UK economy, she has faced tricky questions about her past.",
      "They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed to have worked as an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) immediately before becoming an MP.",
      "One of those who challenged it was a retired former colleague, Kev Gillett.",
      "In a public post on LinkedIn, which he asked followers to share, he wrote: \"Back in 2009 Rt Hon Rachel Reeves worked 3 levels below me. Just facts. She was a Complaints Support Manager at LBG/HBOS. Not an Economist. #factcheck.\"",
      "In fact it emerged that she had worked in a managerial role within the bank's complaint handling department and her LinkedIn profile was updated to remove the claim.",
      "Rachel Reeves's online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England",
      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",
      "Reeves says she won't let critics get her down",
      "MPs raise questions about Rachel Reeves's CV",
      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several formal HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

      "\"Today it's important that everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral [with the US],\" Volodymyr Zelensky said.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine will \"of course\" take part in the negotiations, \"one way or another\", Russian state media reported.",
      "\"There will be a bilateral Russian-American track of that dialogue, and a track that will be associated with the involvement of Ukraine,\" Peskov said.",
      "Sir Keir said the UK needed to \"ramp up the money, the capability and the training\" it has been giving to Ukraine, adding that his government was \"delivering even more of that this year than we were last year\".",
      "Before a Nato meeting in Brussels he told reporters it was really important to put Ukraine in the \"strongest possible position\".",
      "\"This has to be done with Ukraine.\"",
      "Last month, Sir Keir signed a \"landmark\" 100-year pact with the war-stricken country, building on the \u00a312.8bn the UK's already sent to Ukraine, with further commitments of \u00a33bn every year for \"as long as it takes\".",
      "The prime minister's comments echo those of the UK's defence minister, who earlier warned there can be no negotiation \"about Ukraine without Ukraine\".",
      "John Healey said: \"We've seen the calls from President Trump overnight and we all want to see a durable peace and no return to conflict and aggression.\"",
      "He added that Russia \"remains a threat well beyond Ukraine\".",
      "It is becoming harder for Nato to keep a united front on Ukraine, with Trump's unilateral efforts to bring an end to the war.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he and the Russian president had \"agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately\".",
      "He did not set a date for a face-to-face meeting with Putin, but later told reporters at the White House: \"We'll meet in Saudi Arabia.\" He wrote on social media the pair had also invited each other to their respective capitals.",

      "That one phone call between Presidents Trump and Putin, due to be followed up by a meeting, has pushed Nato to the sidelines.",

    "summary": "It comes after more than 100 sites put themselves forward for consideration by a government taskforce.",
    "story": [
      "Work on a number of new towns will begin before the next general election after more than 100 locations across England were put forward, Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook has pledged.",
      "The government says most proposals are to extend existing towns or cities, alongside a \"smaller number\" of new standalone settlements.",
      "The aim is for each new town to have at least 10,000 homes, contributing towards Labour's 1.5 million five-year housebuilding target.",
      "Each should include infrastructure like public transport and schools, alongside affordable housing, ministers say.",
      "A visit to Milton Keynes by the PM to promote the policy was cut short earlier when farmers driving tractors staged a noisy protest.",
      "Ministers desperately want more housing - but are their plans radical enough?",
      "What's the new government's housebuilding target?",
      "Labour to select new town sites by end of first year",

      "It is the latest in a series of protests mounted by farmers against changes to inheritance tax on farms announced at October's Budget.",
      "Creating a new generation of new towns is a key element of the government's long-term plan for housebuilding, and part of its efforts to unlock economic growth.",
      "More than 100 potential sites across England have been suggested to a special taskforce set up to examine the options, after the government asked for expressions of interest from councils, housing developers and landowners.",
      "The sites have not been revealed, but London, the South East, the South West and the east of England have proved the most popular \u2013 though there were expressions of interest from every region.",
      "The taskforce will identify specific locations - as well as funding options - by the summer, with a view to construction on the first sites beginning by the time of the next election.",
      "Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the aim was to build \"well-designed, affordable, attractive homes\" that would \"eventually house millions of people, just as the post-War waves of new towns did\".",
      "He described it as a \"transformational programme\" that he expected to \"make a contribution to housing numbers in this parliament\".",
      "However, speaking on Sky News, he conceded: \"These things take time to get off the ground. No one's pretending that the new towns programme is going to make up the bulk of that 1.5 million number.",
      "\"We're relying on the other changes we've made, including overhauling the national planning policy framework to get new sites coming through.\"",
      "He said he expected some of the construction to take place on greenfield - or undeveloped - land, but there would also be \"big expansions of existing towns and cities where that is appropriate\".",
      "\"There's got to be sustainable places, as I say, they've got to be well-connected, well-designed.\"",
      "The plan envisages an initial injection of government funding to buy land, which would be returned when sites were sold for a higher price to private developers, and would help pay for local infrastructure.",

      "However, it is not clear how much public money will be allocated to the initiative.",
      "Pennycook told Today this would be decided in the government's spending review which will conclude in June and set spending plans for the next three years.",
      "The review, which is being conducted in a period of minimal economic growth against the backdrop of Labour's self-imposed fiscal constraints, will see ministers haggle for money for their departments.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told departments to identify 5% \"efficiency savings\" as part of the process, to ensure key services are prioritised for funding.",
      "Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, urged the government to provide \"serious investment\" in affordable social housing \"to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs\".",
      "\"New towns are a huge opportunity for the government to tackle housing need and provide local communities with homes they can actually afford to live in. The government must commit serious investment at the Spending Review in June to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs.\"",
      "Clement Attlee's 1945-51 government planned the first wave of new towns to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing, with development corporations assigned responsibility for building them.",
      "Stevenage in Hertfordshire was the first such town created, with 10 others following by 1955, including Crawley in Sussex, Harlow in Essex, and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.",

      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",

      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:53:57 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after concerns over the High Court's capacity to hear each individual case in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Labour MP Paul Foster, who voted for the bill at second reading, called the change a \"game changer\" and said he was reconsidering his support.",
      "Foster told the BBC he will now wait until he sees the full bill before deciding whether to vote against it after committee stage.",
      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

    "story": [
      "The UK will not retaliate immediately to the renewal of steel and aluminium tariffs by the US, the government has said.",
      "Trade minister Douglas Alexander said the UK would not have \"a knee-jerk reaction\" but \"a cool and clear-headed\" response.",
      "Many in the industry are calling on Britain to join the EU and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday.",
      "The tariffs, set to apply from 12 March, would mean any steel or aluminium coming into the US would be subject to an import tax worth 25% of its value.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers, and Trump sees imposing tariffs, which will be paid by companies bringing the metal into the US, as a way of shifting away from foreign imports and boosting domestic steel production.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, said Trump had taken a \"sledgehammer to free trade with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world\" as he called for \"stronger action\" from the government.",
      "\"Our high-quality products serve key US industries, many of which cannot source these domestically. This is a moment where our countries should work together to tackle global steel overproduction, not to be at loggerheads,\" he added.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This is because if other countries are no longer exporting to the US, they may look to offload their steel at a cheaper price, potentially leading to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Unite, the union representing UK steel workers, said Trump's announcement \"should be a wake-up call for this government\" as it called on it to buy more British steel in response.",

      "With Trump's tariffs looming - will countries scramble to cut deals?",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "UK ministers planned to meet the steel industry and unions on Tuesday and visit key steel companies later this week.",
      "Speaking in Parliament, Alexander said the US deadline on tariffs coming into force would give the government time to engage with steel firms and unions in the UK, and also with US trade officials.",
      "But shadow trade minister Harriett Baldwin said it was \"a moment of great peril for the UK steel industry because the UK has failed to engage with gusto with the new US administration\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey urged the government to show \"urgency\" in dealing with the issue and protecting jobs.",
      "The UK's direction of travel on tariffs in general appears to be a clear attempt to differentiate it from other G7 allies' attempts to project strength to the White House.",
      "Canada's industry minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has called the decision to impose tariffs \"totally unjustified\" and said its response would be \"clear and calibrated\".",
      "Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "\"We will take a considered approach to this. We will engage with the US on the detail, but the government is clear we will work in our national interest and this issue is no different to that,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Trump has announced and threatened a host of import taxes since taking office, particularly aimed at countries and trading blocs, such as the EU, which export more to the US than they import.",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies buying from overseas, not to the overseas companies selling to them.",
      "The importing company may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly or to absorb the cost themselves, or simply to reduce imports. Foreign exporters could also decide to cut their prices to protect sales.",
      "Trump introduced similar steel and aluminium tariffs in 2018 during his first term, but many countries, including the UK, were later able to work out exemptions.",
      "The US president has said he will not consider any exceptions this time round, although it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken on the phone with Trump and that the US leader was considering an exemption.",
      "Trump has also delayed previously announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico, prompting questions of whether the policies will all go ahead."

      "Lord Mandelson said the UK would not necessarily agree with every detail of Trump's agenda, but added: \"We have to respect and understand what drives him, what his mandate is to do, and how his allies need to adjust sometimes.\"",
      "The 71-year-old spoke to the BBC on Monday, the same day he presented his diplomatic credentials to the US State Department and officially became the ambassador to Washington.",
      "During the interview, he said his past criticisms of Trump were \"ill-judged and wrong\" and was pressed on the differences between the UK and US on Middle East policy.",
      "Asked how he would approach the position of US ambassador, Lord Mandelson said there was already a \"strong relationship between our government and a very warm personal relationship between [Trump] and our prime minister\".",
      "\"Each of us wants to grow our economies,\" he said. \"I think that what we need to do is to build a technology and investment relationship between the US and the UK that's fit for the 21st Century. That's where I want to focus.\"",

      "But he added: \"We actually have a very balanced trade relationship between Britain and the US. I don't believe that his tariffs are actually directly targeted at us.\"",
      "\"That shouldn't make us complacent, and I'm not complacent. I'm going to focus, in a laser-like way, on the dialogue between us to make sure that we do not become collateral damage in the US,\" he continued.",

    "summary": "MPs are holding a debate in the House of Commons on Labour's plans to overhaul border measures.",
    "story": [
      "People smuggling gangs \"have been allowed to take hold\", Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the Commons during a debate on border security.",
      "She accused the last Conservative government of failing to strengthen border enforcement as fast as European countries and focussing on \"failed gimmicks\".",
      "Her comments come as Labour's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which scraps the Tory Rwanda plan and boosts police powers against smugglers, cleared its first vote in the House of Commons.",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the new plans as a \"border surrender Bill\" and claimed it creates a path to citizenship for illegal migrants.",
      "The debate came at the end of a heavily choreographed media push by the Home Office, which saw the department publish photos of illegal immigrants being deported for the first time.",
      "Earlier on Monday, the Home Office also published footage of enforcement teams raiding 828 premises, including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants. They made 609 arrests - a 73% increase on the previous January.",
      "Some Labour MPs, particularly on the left of the party, have argued the government should focus on talking about the benefits of immigration and push for creating safer immigration routes.",
      "Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, warned the new approach left Cooper in \"danger of sounding like she's trying to stigmatise desperate migrants rather than building a fair system\".",
      "Home Office Minister Dame Angela Eagle told the BBC the government's approach was compassionate, and it had only released arrest footage to send a message about the realities of working illegally.",
      "Labour has been pushing its immigration crackdown to the forefront at the same time as Reform UK has been rising in the polls.",
      "Reform MP Richard Tice, said immigration is \"the number one issue because it's out of control\".",
      "He argued reducing immigration numbers \"is of critical concern to the majority of British people\".",
      "As the Commons debate began, the Home Office released new figures showing, since Labour took power in July, the UK has removed 18,987 people, including criminals and failed asylum seekers.",
      "We know that of these returns, only 5,074 were classed as enforced returns. This would suggest the remaining returns were voluntary.",
      "The new returns figure is higher than in the same period the previous year but lower than seven-month periods in 2010 to 2016, when returns topped 20,000.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described the new figures as feeble when compared with the numbers that had entered the country.",
      "The Borders Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists, a promise they made repeatedly in the general election campaign.",
      "Mirroring powers in the Terrorism Act 2000, the proposed new law would criminalise \"precursor\" offences - allowing officials to punish people for legal acts linked to illegal migration, like selling dinghies or outboard motors.",
      "The bill also creates a new crime of endangering another person during an illegal crossing in the Channel. This is to stop those aboard a dinghy refusing assistance.",
      "Immigration enforcement teams would also get new powers to seize mobile phones.",
      "Some migrant rights groups criticise measures they say criminalise vulnerable people rather than people smugglers.",
      "Labour argues this will be a more effective way of clamping down on small boat crossings than the previous government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.",
      "The bill also repeals most of the Conservative's Illegal Migration Act 2023, which laid the legal groundwork for the Rwanda policy.",
      "Under Labour's plans, a new Border Security Command will gain more powers and a new head, who will oversee closer links between intelligence, police, and border agents.",
      "The bill passed its first vote in the House of Commons by 333 to 109 but still faces months of debate and obstacles before it can become law.",
      "Labour's large Commons majority all but guarantees the bulk of the measures will pass.",
      "MPs also rejected an attempt by the Conservatives to kill the bill, voting down their amendment by 354 to 115.",
      "Cooper framed the bill as a decisive step to restoring \"credibility\" to the UK's immigration and asylum system.",
      "\"The gangs have been allowed to take hold for six years,\" Cooper said.",
      "The Conservative government \"failed to act fast with France and other countries to increase enforcement or to prevent the gangs taking hold and instead criminals were let off\".",
      "She told MPs: \"It will take time to loosen that grip and to smash the networks that lie behind them, but there's no alternative to the hard graft of those going after those gang networks who have been getting away with it for far too long.",
      "\"And there's no alternative to working with international partners on this international crime, building new alliances against organised criminals - not just standing on the shoreline shouting at the sea.\"",
      "Ministers want to show toughness on immigration",
      "Illegal workers held in raids on nail bars and takeaways",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Speaking in the Commons, Philp called the plans \"a weak bill from a weak government\".",
      "He criticised Labour for unpicking much of the Illegal Migration Act 2023, including the Rwanda Plan and the section which prevented people who entered the UK illegally from gaining citizenship.",
      "\"I think a bill which creates a path to citizenship for illegal migrants and cancels the obligation on the government to remove people who arrive illegally is a shocking piece of legislation,\" he said",
      "Philp revived the Tory pledge for a cap on immigration - promised by several previous Conservative PMs but never delivered.",
      "\"What is needed is a binding cap which Parliament can vote on, so Parliament can decide how many visas are issued each year,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said the current system \"is not working for anyone\" and argued Labour's bill fails to provide a \"humane, legally sound and effective framework\" for immigration and asylum.",
      "She said the government needed to expand safe and legal routes for asylum seekers, as well as application decision \"so that those with the right to be here can integrate and contribute and those without the right to be here can be returned swiftly\".",

      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",
      "He is understood to already be planning how best to deploy his ultimate line manager with officials considering inviting the president on a second state visit to London.",
      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",
      "Another ally characterises Lord Mandelson's ambition in simpler terms: he has an insatiable thirst for power.",

      "Questions have been raised about the impact this might have on the government's plans for clean energy production by 2030.",
      "But less attention has been given to the impact data centres could have on the supply of fresh, drinkable water to homes and businesses.",
      "Parts of the UK, in the south especially, are already under threat of water shortages because of climate change and population growth.",
      "The government is backing plans for nine new reservoirs to ease the risk of rationing and hosepipe bans during droughts.",
      "But some of these are in areas where new data centres are set to be built.",
      "The first of the government's \"AI growth zones\" will be in Culham, Oxfordshire, at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's campus \u2013 seven miles from the site of a planned new reservoir at Abingdon.",
      "The  4.5 sq mile (7 sq km) reservoir will supply customers in the Thames Valley, London and Hampshire. It is not known how much water the massive new data centres now planned nearby could take from it.",
      "The BBC understands Thames Water has been talking to the government about the challenge of water demand in relation to data centres and how it can be mitigated.",
      "In a new report, the Royal Academy of Engineering calls on the government to ensure tech companies accurately report how much energy and water their data centres are using.",
      "It also calls for environmental sustainability requirements for all data centres, including reducing the use of drinking water, moving to zero use for cooling.",
      "Without such action, warns one of the report's authors, Prof Tom Rodden, \"we face a real risk that our development, deployment and use of AI could do irreparable damage to the environment\".",
      "The tech industry tends to be cagey about water consumption. Most UK data centres contacted for this article did not respond to our inquiries.",
      "Data centres use fresh, mains water, rather than surface water, so that the pipes, pumps and heat exchangers used to cool racks of servers do not get clogged up with contaminants.",
      "The amount used can vary considerably depending on a number of factors including the surrounding environment; sites in colder, wetter parts of the world tend to require less.",
      "Dr Venkatesh Uddameri, a Texas-based expert in water resources management, says a typical data centre can use between 11 million and 19 million litres of water per day, roughly the same as a town of 30,000 to 50,000 people.",
      "His widely quoted calculations are based on arid, or semi arid, climates and do not take into account recent efficiency improvements or developments in AI.",
      "Microsoft's global water use soared by 34% while it was developing its initial AI tools, and a data centre cluster in Iowa used 6% of the district's water supply in one month during the training of OpenAI's GPT-4.",
      "Local resistance to data centres is growing around the world, particularly in areas where water is scarce.",
      "In Chile, Google stopped building a data centre following concerns about its water use, and it redesigned the cooling system at another in Uruguay following local protests.",
      "In the UK, Thames Water has warned data centres they could face restrictions on use during heatwaves.",
      "In 2022, the company said it would review data centres' water use as it prepared to introduce a hosepipe ban during a summer draught.",
      "But Foxglove, a group of campaigning lawyers, found evidence from Thames Water's strategy documents the following year that the firm still did not appear to know how much water its existing data centre customers were using.",
      "Thames Water declined to comment. It signposted its recent five-year plan, which has been approved by the government.",
      "This states that it has no legal obligation to service businesses, and can choose to restrict or refuse water to commercial customers; but this was written before the government designated data centres as Critical National Infrastructure, meaning they will face fewer planning restrictions.",
      "Thames Water filed an objection to a planning application for a new data centre in a cluster in Slough, near Reading, in 2021.",
      "But other proposals in the area have since succeeded: for example in August 2024 the firm Yondr announced that it would be building its third data centre campus there.",
      "Foxglove CEO Martha Dark said: \"The government must urgently explain how its plans for new data centres will not threaten our long-term supplies of drinking water.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"We recognise that data centres face sustainability challenges such as energy demands and water use - that's why AI Growth Zones are designed to attract investment in areas where existing energy and water infrastructure is already in place.\"",
      "In addition, recent changes made by the water regulator Ofwat would \"unlock \u00a3104bn of spending by water companies\" in the next five years.",
      "The data centre industry argues that modern sites are already more efficient. Alternative cooling methods which do not require much water, such as free air cooling and dry cooling, are evolving.",
      "Closed-loop cooling, which involves reusing water, will be deployed in Microsoft's new data centres in Phoenix and Wisconsin.",
      "Aaron Binkley, vice president of sustainability at Digital Realty, acknowledged criticism around data centres' water usage but claimed that the sector was making  \"significant strides\".",
      "His company, which has 300 data centres worldwide, is trialling a new AI tool which analyses operational data and identifies water-saving measures. He says it is predicted to conserve nearly 4m litres of water per year.",
      "Clearly, that is currently an expectation rather than a reality, but Mr Binkley  says it proves that \"AI can drive sustainability as well as technological progress\".",
      "In 2024 the Environment Agency wrote in a blog that by 2050, England alone would need an extra five billion litres of water every day \u2013 it says this is the equivalent of two million wheelie bins-full \u2013 just to serve the population.",
      "But the regulator now needs more data in order to factor in new data centres' future needs.",
      "For the time being, it is urging data centres to forecast and plan their water consumption - and to explore their own sources of water, such as water reuse.",

      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",

      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",

    "summary": "The oil giant faces allegations it ignored warnings that a clean-up scheme was beset by corruption.",
    "story": [
      "A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption.",
      "The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well.",
      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",
      "Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.",
      "It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable.",
      "The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago.",
      "The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.",
      "The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods.",
      "Grace Audi, 37, lives with her partner and two-year-old in Ogale in Rivers state, where there have been at least 40 oil spills from Shell's infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, the UK-law firm representing the communities in this case.",
      "Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, \u00a32.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8.",
      "It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state.",
      "Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.",
      "\"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,\" the 50-year-old mother of six said.",
      "Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.",
      "\"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick.",
      "\"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering.\"",
      "In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area.",
      "It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.",
      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",
      "The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).",
      "This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.",
      "Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m.",
      "However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.",
      "One person aware of the project spoke to the BBC about their concerns - and asked to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.",
      "\"It's common knowledge that really what we're doing is a scam. Most of it is to fool the Ogoni people,\" the whistleblower said.",
      "\"It's a con perpetuated so that more money can be put into the pot and end up in the pockets of politicians and other people in power.\"",
      "The allegations about failings at Hyprep include:",
      "Contracts being awarded to companies that had no relevant experienceLaboratory results being falsified - sometimes labelling contaminated soil and water as cleanProject costs being inflatedExternal auditors on occasion being blocked from checking the clean-up on sites had been done properly.",

      "In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\".",
      "In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.",
      "The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.",
      "But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.",
      "In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.",
      "Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative.\"",
      "This is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched.",
      "In 2015, Shell agreed to a \u00a355m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.",
      "The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.",
      "However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.",
      "Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\".",
      "\"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.",
      "\"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\"",
      "Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.",
      "The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"",
      "The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.",
      "Some locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.",
      "They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.",
      "\"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.",
      "\"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to.",
      "\"It is unclear how Renaissance [Africa] will act going forward. At least with Shell we have means of holding them to account.\"",
      "Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which comes from the Niger Delta region.",
      "Locals, whose main source of livelihood has been agriculture and fishing, told the BBC that since the discovery of oil, or what some refer to as \"black gold\", their home had been pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.",
      "They say they have seen no benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe who blames recent oil spills in Rivers state for her failing crops.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:11:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The findings shed light on a deeply mysterious part of Earth that is key to life on our planet.",
    "story": [
      "The inner core of Earth may have changed shape in the past 20 years, according to a group of scientists.",
      "The inner core is usually thought to be shaped like a ball, but its edges may actually have deformed by 100m or more in height in places, according to Prof John Vidale who led the research.",
      "Earth's core is the beating heart of our planet as it produces a magnetic field that protects life from burning up in the Sun's radiation.",
      "The inner core spins independently from the liquid outer core and from the rest of the planet. Without this motion, Earth would die and become more like barren Mars which lost its magnetic field billions of years ago.",
      "The change in shape could be happening where the edge of the solid inner core touches the extremely hot liquid metal outer core.",
      "The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists were originally trying to find out why the inner core may have slowed down to a slower pace than Earth's rotation before speeding back up again in 2010.",
      "Understanding how the Earth's core works is essential to understanding the magnetic field that protects the planet, and whether that could weaken or stop.",
      "The inside of our planet is an extremely mysterious place. The core is about 4,000 miles from the Earth's surface and, despite best efforts, scientists have so far been unable to reach it.",
      "So, to try to unlock its secrets, some researchers measure the shockwaves caused by earthquakes as they ripple through the planet.",
      "The way the waves travel reveals what type of material they moved through, including in the inner core, and help to paint a picture of what lies beneath our feet.",
      "The new analysis looked at seismic wave patterns from earthquakes that repeated  in the same location between 1991 and 2023. That helped to show how the inner core is changing over time.",
      "Prof Vidale, an earth scientist at the University of Southern California, found more evidence to back up the theory that during those years the inner core slowed down around 2010.",
      "But his team also found the evidence of the inner core's changing shape.",
      "It appears to be happening at the boundary of the inner and outer core, where the inner core is close to melting point. The liquid flow of the outer core as well as pull from an uneven gravity field may cause deformation.",
      "Prof Hrvoje Tkalcic from Australian National University, who was not involved in the study, said the paper provides \"an interesting concept that should be explored further\".",
      "He said it could allow scientists \"to make more informed estimates of some important material properties, such as the viscosity of the inner core, which is one of the least known quantities in modern science\".",
      "Over time the liquid outer core is freezing into the solid inner core, but it will be billions of years before it becomes completely solid.",
      "It would almost certainly mean the end of life on Earth, but by then the planet is already likely to have been swallowed by the Sun.",
      "Prof Vidale's work is part of investigations by experts around the world exploring and arguing over what happens in the core.",
      "\"In science, we generally try to look at things until we understand them,\" Prof Vidale says.",
      "\"In all likelihood, this finding doesn't affect our daily lives one iota, but we really want to understand what's happening in the middle of the Earth,\" he adds.",
      "It is possible that the changes are connected to changes in Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"The magnetic field has had jerks at various times in the past few decades, and we'd like to know if that is related to what we're seeing at the inner core boundary,\" he said.",
      "Prof Vidale urged caution about hyping the findings into ideas that the core is going to stop rotating any time soon.",
      "He also added that there are still lots of uncertainties.",
      "\"We're not 100% sure we're interpreting these changes correctly,\" saying that the boundaries of scientific knowledge are always changing and, like many if not all researchers, he has been wrong in the past."

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:49:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has agreed a new subsidy arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station in north Yorkshire.",
    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

    "summary": "The Public Accounts Committee warns the government of gambling public money on carbon capture.",
    "story": [
      "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.",
      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

      "\"Before, you could hear children shouting\u2026 music everywhere, neighbours arguing,\" he says, \"but now all the sounds have gone\".",
      "His community, living on the tiny low-lying island of Gardi Sugdub, is the first in Panama to be relocated because of climate change.",
      "The government has said they face \"imminent risk\" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.",
      "The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.",
      "\"My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,\" says Delfino. \"Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.",
      "House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.",
      "He says he wants to stay close to the ocean, where he can fish. \"The people that lose their tradition lose their soul. The essence of our culture is on the islands,\" he adds.",
      "The Guna have lived on Gardi Sugdub since the 19th Century, and even longer on other islands in this archipelago off Panama's northern coast. They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups.",
      "They are known for their clothes called \"molas\", decorated with colourful designs.",
      "The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands. Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is \"almost a certainty\" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century.",
      "As climate change causes the Earth to heat up, sea levels are rising as glaciers and ice sheets melt and seawater expands as it warms.",
      "Scientists warn that hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas around the world could be at risk by the end of the century.",
      "On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.",
      "Mr Paton says, \"it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise\".",
      "However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.",
      "The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Mart\u00ednez, fear the rising sea:",
      "\"Every year, we saw the tides were higher,\" she says. \"We couldn't cook on our stoves and it was always flooded\u2026 so we said 'we have to get out of here'.\"",

      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",

      "The lawsuit claims the children died trying the \"blackout challenge\", in which a person intentionally deprives themselves of oxygen.",
      "Giles Derrington, senior government relations manager at TikTok, told BBC Radio 5 Live there were some things \"we simply don't have\" because of \"legal requirements around when we remove data\".",
      "Speaking on Safer Internet Day, a global initiative to raise awareness about online harms, Mr Derrington said TikTok had been in contact with some of the parents, adding that they \"have been through something unfathomably tragic\".",

      "Ellen Roome, mother of 14-year-old Jools, said she had been trying to obtain data from TikTok that she thinks could provide clarity on his death. She is campaigning for legislation to grant parents access to their child's social media accounts if they die.",
      "\"We want TikTok to be forthcoming, to help us - why hold back on giving us the data?\" Lisa Kenevan, mother of 13-year-old Isaac, told the programme. \"How can they sleep at night?\"",
      "Asked why TikTok had not given the data the parents had been asking for, Mr Derrington said:",

      "\"So this is a more complicated situation than us just having something we're not giving access to.",

      "It claims their children died participating in a trend that circulated widely on TikTok in 2022, despite the site having rules around not showing or promoting dangerous content that could cause significant physical harm.",
      "While Mr Derrington would not comment on the specifics of the ongoing case, he said of the parents: \"I have young kids myself and I can only imagine how much they want to get answers and want to understand what's happened.",
      "\"We've had conversations with some of those parents already to try and help them in that.\"",
      "He said the so-called \"blackout challenge\" predated TikTok, adding: \"We have never found any evidence that the blackout challenge has been trending on the platform.",

      "Parts of the UK, in the south especially, are already under threat of water shortages because of climate change and population growth.",
      "The government is backing plans for nine new reservoirs to ease the risk of rationing and hosepipe bans during droughts.",
      "But some of these are in areas where new data centres are set to be built.",
      "The first of the government's \"AI growth zones\" will be in Culham, Oxfordshire, at the UK Atomic Energy Authority's campus \u2013 seven miles from the site of a planned new reservoir at Abingdon.",
      "The  4.5 sq mile (7 sq km) reservoir will supply customers in the Thames Valley, London and Hampshire. It is not known how much water the massive new data centres now planned nearby could take from it.",
      "The BBC understands Thames Water has been talking to the government about the challenge of water demand in relation to data centres and how it can be mitigated.",
      "In a new report, the Royal Academy of Engineering calls on the government to ensure tech companies accurately report how much energy and water their data centres are using.",
      "It also calls for environmental sustainability requirements for all data centres, including reducing the use of drinking water, moving to zero use for cooling.",
      "Without such action, warns one of the report's authors, Prof Tom Rodden, \"we face a real risk that our development, deployment and use of AI could do irreparable damage to the environment\".",
      "The tech industry tends to be cagey about water consumption. Most UK data centres contacted for this article did not respond to our inquiries.",
      "Data centres use fresh, mains water, rather than surface water, so that the pipes, pumps and heat exchangers used to cool racks of servers do not get clogged up with contaminants.",
      "The amount used can vary considerably depending on a number of factors including the surrounding environment; sites in colder, wetter parts of the world tend to require less.",
      "Dr Venkatesh Uddameri, a Texas-based expert in water resources management, says a typical data centre can use between 11 million and 19 million litres of water per day, roughly the same as a town of 30,000 to 50,000 people.",

      "Thames Water declined to comment. It signposted its recent five-year plan, which has been approved by the government.",
      "This states that it has no legal obligation to service businesses, and can choose to restrict or refuse water to commercial customers; but this was written before the government designated data centres as Critical National Infrastructure, meaning they will face fewer planning restrictions.",
      "Thames Water filed an objection to a planning application for a new data centre in a cluster in Slough, near Reading, in 2021.",
      "But other proposals in the area have since succeeded: for example in August 2024 the firm Yondr announced that it would be building its third data centre campus there.",
      "Foxglove CEO Martha Dark said: \"The government must urgently explain how its plans for new data centres will not threaten our long-term supplies of drinking water.\"",

      "In 2024 the Environment Agency wrote in a blog that by 2050, England alone would need an extra five billion litres of water every day \u2013 it says this is the equivalent of two million wheelie bins-full \u2013 just to serve the population.",
      "But the regulator now needs more data in order to factor in new data centres' future needs.",

      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",

      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",

People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",

      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:20:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Many world leaders, including Ukraine's President Zelensky, are finding the world is more uncertain under new US leadership.",
    "story": [
      "America is under new management. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is joining a growing list of US allies who are finding that the world according to Donald Trump is a colder, more uncertain and potentially more dangerous place for them.",
      "It must have been bad enough for Zelensky to hear Trump's abrupt announcement that he had welcomed Russia's President Vladimir Putin back to international diplomacy with a 90-minute phone call, to be followed by a face-to-face meeting, perhaps in Saudi Arabia.",
      "After Putin, the White House dialled up Zelensky's number. Speaking to journalists in Ukraine the morning after, Zelensky accepted the fact that Putin received the first call, \"although to be honest, it's not very pleasant\".",
      "What stung Zelensky more was that Trump, who rang him after he spoke to Putin, seemed to regard him, at best, as a junior adjunct to any peace talks. One of Zelensky's many nightmares must be the prospect of Trump and Putin attempting to settle Ukraine's future without anyone else in the negotiation.",
      "He told the journalists that Ukraine \"will not be able to accept any agreements\" made without its involvement.",
      "It was vital, he said, that \"everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral\".",
      "President Zelensky is heading to the Munich security conference, starting on Friday, where he will attempt to rally Ukraine's allies. He faces a tough meeting with Trump's vice president, JD Vance, who was one of the sternest critics of Joe Biden's aid to Ukraine.",
      "The argument Zelensky will hear from the Americans is that Ukraine is losing and it needs to get real about what happens next. He will argue that Ukraine can win - with the right backing.",
      "The European Union is worried too. After meeting and praising the Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov, the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas posted that Europe must have a central role in any negotiation. \"Our priority now must be strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees,\" Kallas said.",
      "Zelensky is painfully aware that while his European allies are sounding much more steadfast than the Americans, the US remains the world's strongest military power. He told the Guardian last week that \"security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees\".",
      "Collectively, European allies have given Ukraine more money than the US. But the Americans have weapons and air defence systems - like the Patriot missile batteries that protect Kyiv - that Europeans simply cannot provide.",
      "Putin will be delighted that he is getting a much easier ride than he had from Biden. The former US president called Putin, among other things, a \"pure thug\", a \"brutal tyrant\" and a \"murderous dictator\" and cut off contact after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Just to drive home the point that everything had changed, Trump followed up yesterday's positive assessment of his talk with Putin with an upbeat early morning post on his platform, Truth Social, reflecting on \"great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday\". There was now a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!\"",
      "Putin is not just back in conversation with the most powerful country in the world. With Trump, he may now see himself as the arbiter of the endgame in the war he started when he broke international law with the all-out invasion of Ukraine almost exactly three years ago.",
      "At the White House, Trump seemed to suggest that the huge numbers of dead and wounded in the Russian military gave some kind of legitimacy to Putin's demand to keep the land captured and annexed by Russia.",
      "\"They took a lot of land and they fought for that land,\" Trump said. As for Ukraine, \"some of it will come back\".",
      "His defence secretary Pete Hegseth's remarks at a Nato meeting in Brussels were more direct. He wanted Ukraine to be \"sovereign and prosperous\". But \"we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective\".",
      "\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "Trump is still at the easy end of what could become an impossibly tough diplomatic challenge. Boasting that he has the key to ending the Russo-Ukraine war is one thing. Making that happen is something else.",
      "His declaration before any talks with Russia start that Ukraine will not join Nato nor get back all its occupied land has been widely criticised as a poor start by a man who claims to be the world's best dealmaker.",
      "The veteran Swedish diplomat and politician Carl Bildt posted an ironic rebuke on X.",
      "\"It's certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started. Not even Chamberlain went that low in 1938. That Munich ended very bad anyhow.\"",
      "Bildt posted a photo of Britain's then prime minister Neville Chamberlain on his return from Munich in 1938, waving the notorious and worthless agreement he had made with Adolf Hitler - the price of which was the capitulation and break-up of Czechoslovakia and a faster slide towards a second world war.",
      "After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Vladimir Putin was widely portrayed in the west as the new threat to European peace. Trump's approach to him is very different.",
      "He will have to try to bridge the gap between Putin and Zelensky's positions, which are polar opposites.",
      "Zelensky's declared objective is to regain Ukraine's lost territory, which amounts to around a fifth of its total land mass. He also wants Ukraine to become a full member of Nato.",
      "Putin insists that any peace deal would require Ukraine to give up the land Russia has captured, as well as areas it has not occupied, including the city of Zaporizhzhia which has a population of more than half a million. Ukraine would also become neutral, demilitarised and would never join Nato.",
      "Ukraine's demands will not be acceptable to Moscow, and Trump has indicated he doesn't like them either.",
      "But Russia's amount to an ultimatum, not a serious peace proposal. Trump, once a developer, likes deals that involve tangible real estate. But Putin wants more than land. He wants Ukraine to go back to the relationship it had with the Kremlin during the days when it was part of the Soviet Union. For that to happen, Ukraine would have to lose its independence and sovereignty.",
      "Biden offered Ukraine enough not to lose, because he took Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons if Nato intervened seriously. Trump must be aware of nuclear danger, but he also believes backing Ukraine indefinitely is a bad deal for the US, and he can do better.",
      "As for the Europeans, he might force them to face up to the gross disparity between their military promises to Ukraine and their military capabilities. Only Poland and the Baltic states are backing their public statements about the threat from Russia with qualitatively increased defence spending.",
      "With Russia grinding forward on the battlefields of eastern Ukraine, this is the toughest moment Zelensky will have faced since the dark and desperate first months of the war, when Ukraine fought off Russia's attack on Kyiv.",

      "They said the women found strength through sharing stories, drawing and keeping a diary.",
      "None of the women have given interviews to the media since their release, and their parents say the full details of what they endured are still emerging. There are also things they can't speak about due to fears it could put the hostages still in Gaza at risk.",
      "Three of the four women whose parents spoke to the BBC were female soldiers kidnapped by Hamas from the Nahal Oz army base near Gaza on 7 October 2023.",
      "The hostages' access to food and their treatment by male guards varied over the 15 months they were held, their parents said. They were moved between locations, rarely seeing sunlight.",
      "\"It was very different between the places that she went - it could be a good tunnel, it could be a very bad tunnel. It could be a good house or a bad house,\" said the father of Agam Berger, 20, a soldier who had been at Nahal Oz.",
      "Some of the places had good food, some had \"very bad food... they just tried to survive,\" Shlomi Berger said.",
      "\"They [and their captors] had to run away from one place to another because they are in a war zone there. It was very dangerous to be there,\" said Orly Gilboa, whose daughter Daniella was also kidnapped from the base.",

      "\"She got thinner, she lost a lot of her weight through the captivity. But in the last two months they were given a lot of food to gain weight,\" Ms Gilboa says.",
      "Other parents have also reported significant weight loss. Meirav Leshem Gonen's daughter was taken by Hamas from the Nova music festival.",
      "Romi, 24, was released in the first week of the ceasefire in January - she had lost \"20% of her body weight\", says her mother.",
      "Ms Gilboa says the hardest thing she endured was seeing a video that suggested her daughter had been killed. Her captors poured powder on her so she looked like she was covered in plaster, as if she was killed in an Israeli military strike.",
      "\"I think everyone who saw it believed it, but I just kept telling myself that it can't be,\" she told the BBC.",
      "The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage.",
      "More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been destroyed or damaged, estimates the UN.",

      "\"Sometimes they tortured other female hostages in front of her eyes,\" he says, referring specifically to an assault on Amit Soussana, a former hostage who was released in November 2023.",
      "Mr Berger says his daughter told him how they were constantly watched over by armed men, \"playing all the time with their guns and their hand grenades\".",
      "He says the male captors treated the women with \"big disrespect\", including forcing them to clean and prepare food.",

      "An Israeli government spokesman did not comment on the reports but stated that if Hamas did not free three living hostages on Saturday then the ceasefire would end.",
      "Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations.",
      "Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied.",
      "The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and \"let hell break out\" unless \"all of the hostages\" were returned by Saturday.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Trump's demand and warned: \"If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas.\"",
      "However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend.",
      "Confusion clouds efforts to save Gaza ceasefire",
      "'We are tired of war': Israelis and Gazans fear ceasefire collapse",
      "What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were \"intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement\", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials.",
      "After concluding the talks on Thursday morning, Hamas put out a statement saying they focused on the need for all terms of the deal to be fulfilled, particularly regarding deliveries of caravans, tents, heavy construction equipment, medical supplies and fuel.",
      "It added that the talks were \"positive\" and that the mediators had agreed to work to \"remove obstacles and close gaps\".",
      "\"Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to implementing the agreement as signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timeline.\"",
      "At the same time, Egyptian state-run Al Qahera TV reported that Egypt and Qatar had successfully \"overcome obstacles\" and that Israel and Hamas were committed to fully implementing the ceasefire deal.",
      "Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV also said the negotiations had been successful and that mobile homes and heavy machinery would be allowed into Gaza on Thursday.",
      "However, Israeli media then cited the Israeli prime minister's office as calling the Al Jazeera report \"fake news\" and saying there was \"no basis\" to it.",
      "Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the prime minister, later clarified the denial, writing on X: \"There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no co-ordination for this.\"",
      "When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was \"crystal clear\".",
      "\"There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,\" David Mencer said. \"That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday.\"",
      "\"If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end.\"",
      "War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war.",
      "\"When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,\" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.",
      "\"I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall.\"",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza.",
      "So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal.",
      "The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named.",
      "Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the 43 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun.",
      "The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."

    "story": [
      "The US will be present at talks over the future of the Chagos Islands, which has been the subject of a controversial deal between Mauritius and the UK, the Mauritian prime minister has said.",
      "Last October, the UK announced it would hand over sovereignty of the islands,  known officially as the British Indian Ocean Territory, to Mauritius but would maintain a 99-year lease over the UK-US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia.",
      "The deal was reached with former Mauritian leader Pravind Jugnauth, but Navin Ramgoolam, his replacement, has been very critical.",
      "Progress has also been delayed to allow officials from incoming President Donald Trump's team to look at the details of the deal.",
      "The agreement struck in October - which had been greenlit by the Biden administration - includes the UK paying lease payments to Mauritius for the UK-US military airbase.",

      "He also objected to a clause where the UK could unilaterally extend the lease on Diego Garcia for another 40 years.",
      "It is unclear what the US stance on the deal is exactly, but last year, before he was in office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it posed a \"serious threat\", arguing it gives the islands to a country aligned with China. Mauritius has a trade agreement with China.",
      "The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the Diego Garcia base.",

      "At the same time, Israeli troops have withdrawn to just inside the perimeter of Gaza, including along the Egypt border.",
      "The relative calm has allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to their own neighbourhoods and brought in a surge of humanitarian aid.",
      "However, the current impasse stems from Hamas's claim that Israel has not upheld its promises for the first phase of the truce.",
      "It says that this required Israeli authorities to allow about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans into Gaza.",
      "With so many people returning to the ruins of their homes - during cold, wet wintry weather - such shelters have been desperately needed.",

    "story": [
      "European nations must provide the \"overwhelming\" share of funding for Ukraine, the new US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said, as he signalled a drastic shift in Washington's position on the war.",
      "Speaking at a defence summit in Brussels, Hegseth said the US would no longer \"tolerate an imbalanced relationship\" with its allies and called on Nato members to spend much more on defence.",
      "He also said it was \"unrealistic\" to expect Ukraine to return to its pre-2014 borders and downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato.",
      "The comments came as Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held a \"lengthy\" phone call in which they agreed to begin negotiations to end the war.",
      "The new US defence secretary's remarks are the clearest indication yet of the Trump administration's position on the Ukraine war and what a peace plan to end the conflict could involve.",
      "The positions set out by Hegseth will be met with dismay in Ukraine - which has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal - and will be welcomed by Moscow.",
      "There will also be nervousness across the continent after Hegseth suggested the US would significantly scale back its support for Ukraine, insisting that European nations would now need to provide the \"overwhelming share\" of aid to Kyiv.",
      "Hegseth, who was appointed defence secretary after Trump returned to the US presidency in January, was speaking at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, a meeting of more than 40 countries allied to Ukraine.",
      "He said: \"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine.",
      "\"But we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.",
      "\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014 and then backed pro-Russian separatists in an armed insurgency against Kyiv's forces in eastern Ukraine.",
      "Moscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, mainly in the east and south.",
      "Hegseth said any durable peace must include \"robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again\".",
      "However, he said \"the United States does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement\".",
      "Instead, security guarantees should be backed by \"capable European and non-European troops\".",
      "\"If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-Nato mission and they should not be covered under Article 5,\" he said, referring to the alliance's mutual defence clause.",

      "What is Nato and why isn't Ukraine a member?",

      "\"Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of Nato,\" Hegseth said. \"Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.\"",
      "The US has been Ukraine's biggest financial and military backer but Trump has been repeatedly critical of US aid spending and has said his priority is to end the war, which escalated in February 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "Hegseth echoed calls by Trump for Nato allies to increase their defence spending to 5% of their GDP, instead of the current 2% target - saying the latter is \"not enough\".",
      "The US currently spends roughly 3.4% of its GDP on defence, while the UK spends about 2.3%. Countries closer to Russia, like Poland and the Baltic states, spend the most proportionately at around 4%.",

    "summary": "The leaders share a warm relationship, but both will have their own wish list when they meet this week.",
    "story": [
      "When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later on Thursday, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all.",
      "Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances. This time, they will also hold a joint press briefing, according to the White House.",
      "Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership.",
      "Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi.",
      "And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place.",
      "Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community.",
      "He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India.",
      "And yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands.",
      "Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil.",
      "It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration.",
      "Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (\u00a337.10bn) in recent years.",
      "On Wednesday evening, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump planned to announce reciprocal tariffs on other countries before his meeting with Modi.",
      "But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides.",
      "In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.",
      "Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger.",
      "Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil.",
      "In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US.",
      "Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel.",
      "India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment.",
      "Technology will probably be discussed as well.",
      "This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it.",
      "Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will.",
      "Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US.",
      "Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large.",
      "Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran, which hints at removing sanctions waivers for those conducting commercial activities in Chabahar. Modi may seek clarity on what this means for Delhi.",
      "Trump may also gauge Modi's position on a big foreign policy priority: ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Delhi has a strong interest in these wars winding down. Modi's position on the war in Ukraine - calling for an end to the conflict without criticising Putin or Russia - echoes that of Trump.",
      "India's special relationship with Russia and close ties with Israel may prompt Trump to see if Modi would want to play a third-party mediator role as well. Modi would probably be comfortable doing so only if the parties are receptive to outside mediation.",
      "But despite some potentially delicate discussions this week, both leaders will want to maintain a positive tone.",
      "In that regard, the Indo-Pacific Quad will be just what the doctor ordered.",
      "Trump strongly backs this group which consists of the US, India, Japan and Australia and focuses on countering Beijing.",
      "In his first term, Trump elevated the Quad's annual meetings to the foreign minister level and Biden elevated them further to the leaders' level.",
      "India is scheduled to host this year's Quad meeting and Modi may invite Trump to Delhi to attend this.",
      "Trump reportedly is not a big fan of international travel but India is a trip he will probably be keen to make - to deepen his personal relationship with Modi and to advance a multifaceted bilateral partnership that extends well beyond the transactionalism that will carry the day in Washington this week.",

      "Austria's far-right populist Freedom Party says it has ended its attempts to form a coalition government with the conservative People's Party, \u00d6VP.",
      "The announcement follows several weeks of heated negotiations and marks the second time coalition talks have failed since September's election.",
      "The \u00d6VP first attempted to form a three-party coalition with the Social Democrats and the liberal NEOS, then a two-party coalition with the Social Democrats - but both efforts collapsed.",
      "With the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) unable to form a government, Austria is now in an unclear political situation.",
      "The leader of the Freedom Party, Herbert Kickl, has called for swift new elections and blamed \u00d6VP for the collapse, accusing the party of being unwilling to make compromises and playing \"power games\".",
      "\"Although we made concessions to the \u00d6VP on many points, they were not prepared to make decisive compromises. The \u00d6VP was concerned with power games and posturing - we, the Freedom Party, were concerned with security, prosperity and honesty.\"",
      "Earlier, Kickl told President Alexander Van der Bellen that he was giving up the mandate to form what would have been Austria's first far-right-led government since the FP\u00d6 was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s.",
      "The Russia-friendly and Eurosceptic Freedom Party made history in September's general election when it topped the polls for the first time with 28.8% of the vote, narrowly beating Chancellor Karl Nehammer's \u00d6VP, which got 26.3%.",
      "Despite this, in October, President Van der Bellen first gave Nehammer the mandate to form a government. However, those negotiations collapsed in early January, leading Nehammer to resign and paving the way for interim Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.",
      "On 6 January, Van der Bellen gave Kickl the mandate to form a government after other parties' efforts to create a coalition without the Freedom Party failed.",
      "Coalition negotiations in Austria usually remain secret, until a decision is reached. But over recent days, both parties issued statements about their demands, suggesting that the talks were in trouble.",
      "The Freedom Party wanted both the powerful finance ministry and the interior ministry, which was a major obstacle for the \u00d6VP. For its part, the \u00d6VP wanted confirmation of \"the absence of Russian influence in Austria,\" and Vienna remaining \"a reliable partner to the European Union\".",
      "Kickl said on Wednesday that he was giving up the mandate, writing in a statement that he did \"not take this step without regret\".",
      "He continued: \"The \u00d6VP insisted on clarifying the allocation of portfolios at the beginning of February. Although we made concessions to the \u00d6VP on many points in the subsequent talks, the negotiations were ultimately unsuccessful, much to our regret.\"",
      "The General Secretary of the \u00d6VP, Alexander Pr\u00f6ll, said the talks had failed because Kickl was on a \"power trip\" and had refused to compromise.",
      "\"Herbert Kickl himself was hardly involved in the government negotiations. In five weeks, Kickl sat at the negotiating table for a total of seven hours,\" he said.",
      "\"He did not fulfil his mandate to form\u2026 a centre-right government. Instead, he insisted on all his demands, developed fantasies of total power and ended the talks.\"",
      "Political analyst Thomas Hofer told the BBC that there was \"no base of trust\" between the two parties.",
      "\"Kickl tried to adopt Trump's playbook of 'promises kept' but that's hard in a coalition environment.",
      "\"The \u00d6VP decided in the end that losing the two major ministries with a Chancellor Kickl who can't be controlled, and no base of trust was too risky,\" he said.",
      "The \u00d6VP was the only party that had been willing to negotiate with the Freedom Party.",
      "President Alexander Van der Bellen said Austria now had four options after the collapse of the coalition talks.",
      "These were new elections, a minority government, a government of experts or another attempt to form a government by the parliamentary parties, he said.",
      "He said he would hold talks with the political parties in Austria over the next few days to see which option was realistic.",

    "summary": "A wildfire has burnt through 55% of Amsterdam Island, a French foreign territory in the Indian Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly a month the French territory of Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean has been engulfed in flames.",
      "Located about halfway between Australia, Antarctica and Madagascar, the island has seen burning across more than 55% of its 54 sq km area.",
      "Amsterdam Island doesn't have a permanent population but researchers have been stationed there since the 1980s.",
      "Since the fires broke out, 31 people have been evacuated to R\u00e9union Island, closer to Madagascar. And last week French authorities launched a mission to control the wildfires and assess their impact.",
      "The most recent blaze was discovered on15 January by a scientist researching the atmosphere.",
      "According to a report from the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences (LCES),  it broke out near the Pointe B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte observatory which monitors greenhouse gases, mercury, and aerosols in the atmosphere.",
      "Despite residents' best efforts, the fire spread towards the research base at Martin-de-Vivi\u00e8s. They were evacuated early the following day by a lobster fishing boat, the Austral, which was cruising nearby.",
      "R\u00e9mi Chazot, a computer scientist who was based on the island, told Le Monde newspaper the group was \"incredibly lucky\" that the boat was in the area.",
      "\"This boat should have left a week earlier, but it had not caught its lobster quota. Otherwise, things would have gotten complicated.\"",
      "The evacuees have since been transferred to Reunion, another French territory.",
      "The fire spread across Amsterdam Island due to dry conditions and strong winds. The island does not have a river and winds can reach up to 40 km/h (24 mph). It is thought to have partly spread via the island's network of peat bogs.",
      "Although the full scale of the damage has not yet been assessed, satellite imagery has shown the island's solar panels have been affected by the fire as well as its food and communication lines.",
      "Conservationists have also expressed concern about the impact on wildlife.",
      "Due to its unusual climate, the island is rich in biodiversity, serving as a breeding site for southern elephant and sub- Antarctic fur seals.",
      "It is home to several albatross species including the Amsterdam Albatross, which breed exclusively on the island, and 84% of the world's yellow-nosed albatross population. A colony of Southern rockhopper penguin also live on the island.",
      "Due to its remoteness and subsequent lack of pollution, the island is also used to research changes in the atmosphere and how this affects climate.",
      "The evacuation is the first time atmospheric research has been suspended on the island for 45 years.",
      "\"It will take time and money to return to normal and this pause will mean quite a lack of data acquisition for our research\", said Marc Delotte, the director of the LCES's mission to the Amsterdam Islands.",
      "\"This is, of course, not a good news for such a unique location.\"",
      "On the 7 February a reconnaissance mission set sail aboard a French navy vessel.",
      "According to France's Southern and Antarctic Territories department, the mission is made up of four firefighters from Reunion and seven technical staff, one of whom is a doctor.",
      "Rather than putting out the fire entirely, the mission intends to secure the settlement. They'll also aim to uncover the cause of the fire and how it spread, as well as re-establish the island's energy and water mains."

    "summary": "The BBC's Frank Gardner says Nato's unity is badly dented with decisions over Ukraine set to be discussed in Munich.",
    "story": [
      "The US Vice President, JD Vance, Ukraine's President Zelensky and up to 60 other world leaders and decision-makers are due to convene in Munich over the next three days for the annual Munich Security Conference (MSC).",
      "For nearly two decades now I have been attending and covering this event for the BBC and I cannot think of a year when there has been so much at stake in terms of global security. A senior and highly experienced Western official said this week \"this is the most dangerous and contested time I have ever known in my career\".",
      "Why?",
      "Put simply, the current world security order \u2013 the catchily named International Rules-based Order \u2013 is in danger of crumbling. Some would argue this is already happening.",
      "The end of consensus",
      "When President Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago it was widely condemned by much \u2013 although not all \u2013 of the world. Nato, the EU and the West in general reached an extraordinary level of unity in coming together to help Ukraine defend itself, without getting drawn into direct conflict with Russia.",
      "Barring some demurring from Slovakia and Hungary, there was a general consensus that Putin's invasion must be seen to fail or Nato itself would be critically weakened while Russia would eventually be tempted to invade another neighbouring country, such as Estonia. It was often said that Ukraine should be given whatever it took and for as long as it took in order to secure a lasting peace from a position of strength.",
      "Not any more.",
      "President Trump has effectively pulled the rug out from Ukraine's negotiating position by conceding, via his Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, that restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply \"not realistic\".",
      "The US has also dashed Kyiv's hopes of joining Nato, a key ambition of President Zelensky, and ruled out sending US troops to help protect its borders from the next time Russia decides to invade.",
      "An even greater shock has come with the news that President Trump held an apparently cordial 90-minute phone call with President Putin, thus abruptly ending the West's three-year freeze in talking to the Russian leader that has been in place since the time of the invasion.",
      "Over the next 72 hours we will be hearing in Munich from President Trump's team here in Munich what the details of their plan for Ukraine will be. Some of it is still to be worked out after his envoy, retired US Army General Keith Kellogg, travels to Kyiv next week.",
      "But for now, Nato's unity is badly dented as clearly there is a wide difference of opinion over Ukraine between Washington and Europe. One wants the war to end as quickly as possible, even if it means conceding to many of Moscow's demands.",
      "The other still believed, at least until this week, that with Russia losing around a thousand battlefield casualties a day and its economy facing dire long-term problems the best way to win a lasting peace would be to keep up the pressure on Moscow until it its army was exhausted and it agreed to peace terms more favourable to Ukraine.",
      "That won't be happening now.",
      "Worrying cracks in Nato",
      "For the Nato alliance, now in its 76th year, there are other worrying cracks starting to appear which will also come in for discussion here at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "Last month President Trump announced he wanted to \"buy\" Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark. When Denmark's Prime Minister Frederiksson assured her population that \"Greenland is not for sale\" there followed what was called a \"horrendous\" phone call from Donald Trump who has not ruled out the use of force to take Greenland.",
      "The idea of one Nato country threatening to seize part of another Nato country's territory would have been unthinkable up until now. In Greenland's case there is no justification for it on security grounds since there are more US troops on Greenland than Danish and Copenhagen is happy to agree ways to boost mutual defence for the island.",
      "But even if nothing ever comes of this idea, and most of Scandinavia is dearly hoping that is the case, in some respects the damage has already been done. The message has gone out from the leader of the free world that its OK to threaten your neighbours by force if you want their territory.",
      "\"It may be,\" says Lord Kim Darroch, the former UK national security adviser and British Ambassador to Washington, \"that Trump's threat of economic measures against Nato ally Denmark, and his refusal to rule out military action against them, are just negotiating tactics. But even if nothing comes from it, it's done great damage. It's another signal of Trump's disdain for Nato. And it will be interpreted in Moscow and Beijing as a message that they have a free hand in Ukraine and Taiwan respectively\".",
      "Washington's European allies will be looking for some reassurance here in Munich that that is not the case. But President Trump is already well on the way to reshaping America's role in the world and the indications are he is unlikely to be listening to any complaints coming from Europe.",

This allows it to predict things like people's shopping habits, create new content in text and images, and also carry on conversations like a person.",
      "The chatbot has struck a chord in China partly because it is far better than other homegrown AI apps, but also because it offers something unique: its AI model, R1, lets users see its \"thought process\" before delivering a response.",

      "\"It was my first time seeking counsel from DeepSeek. When I read its thought process, I felt so moved that I cried,\" the woman wrote on RedNote.",
      "In reasoning through her query, DeepSeek suggested that the woman's self-perception as an over-sharer might stem from a deep desire for approval.",
      "The chatbot gives itself a mental note: \"Response should offer practical advice while being empathetic.\" This could include \"affirming the user's sense of self-awareness\".",

      "When the BBC asked DeepSeek if Taiwan was a sovereign nation, the app initially offered a comprehensive response detailing Taipei's and Beijing's different perspectives, acknowledging that this was a \"complex and politically sensitive issue\".",

      "Musk, meanwhile, has been clear that he believes he is working to enact the wishes of Trump's voters.",
      "\"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" he told reporters during a surprise White House appearance this week. \"That's what democracy is all about.\"",
      "A recent poll by the BBC's US partner CBS News suggested a majority of Americans were in favour of Musk's work but disagreed over how much influence he should have.",
      "In Erie, plenty of supporters were thrilled to see not one billionaire businessman, but two, running the show in Washington.",
      "Christine Barber shrugged off concerns and said the American people had elected Trump to run the country and he had appointed Musk to help him do that.",
      "\"Personally, I love him,\" she said of Musk.",
      "\"Financially, and from a business perspective, we need somebody who knows what the heck they're doing. And if anybody does, it's Donald Trump and Elon Musk.\"",

      "\"The guy's obviously brilliant,\" Laughlan said of Musk. \"He's doing a good job trying to get rid of waste. Both of those gentlemen are trying to get money back to Americans.\"",
      "Evan Lagace, a restaurant manager here, embraces Musk's cuts to a system he views as bloated and inefficient. He said he appreciated that the tech billionaire was \"donating his time to the country to help fix a major problem\".",
      "\"Like he did in a micro aspect with Twitter, he could hopefully do the same thing with our country,\" Lagace said, referring to the mass layoffs and spending cuts Musk implemented after buying the social media company.",
      "As for the accusations that Musk had grown too powerful in this White House, Lagace said it did not bother him.",
      "\"He's already extremely powerful,\" he said. \"It makes no difference.\""

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Politicians in the country want to prohibit the sale of such items, but they face opposition.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed law in Colombia's Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose cocaine cartel has been linked to thousands of murders.",
      "One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news.",
      "His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning.",
      "\"I remember leaving and seeing my mum and grandma waiting for me, crying,\" says Mr Rojas, who was just 10-years-old at the time. \"It was a very, very sad day.\"",
      "Minutes after take off, an explosion on board Avianca flight 203 killed the 107 passengers and crew, as well as three people on the ground who were hit by falling debris.",
      "The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel.",
      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",
      "In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medell\u00edn popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of \"history\".",
      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 01:35:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president is ratcheting up pressure on South Africa over its domestic and foreign policy.",
    "story": [
      "South Africa appears to be at a crossroads in its waxing and waning relationship with the US following President Donald Trump's controversial decision last week to cut financial aid to the country.",
      "Trump said South Africa was pursuing what he called \"unjust and immoral practices\" against the white minority Afrikaner community and by filing a genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.",
      "His move has sent shockwaves across South Africa, with experts fearing he may go on to use this opportunity to end preferential access to the US market through its special US-Africa trade programme known as the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa).",
      "The two countries have generally had friendly relations since the end of white-minority rule in 1994 when anti-apartheid icon and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela was elected South Africa's first black president.",
      "Though it took the US another 14 years to remove Mandela from its \"terrorist watch list\" for his role in fighting the racist system of apartheid, which had been introduced by South Africa's then-Afrikaner rulers in1948.",
      "The latest tension flared up a few days after Trump's inauguration last month when South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law the Expropriation Bill, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.",
      "Trump's response came last week when he threatened to cut future funding over what he termed \"terrible things, horrible things\" the country's leadership was doing.",
      "The US president further accused South Africa, without any basis in fact, of \"confiscating land\" and \"doing things that are perhaps far worse than that\".",
      "He doubled down in the face of the South African government's vehement rebuttal and signed an executive order last Friday freezing aid.",
      "This adds up to nearly $440m (\u00a3353m) - the amount of aid reportedly allocated in 2023 - though the US embassy in South Africa has subsequently said that funding from Pepfar, an American programme countering the global spread of HIV, will not be affected, adding the caveat that \"not all Pepfar activities will resume\".",
      "South Africa is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Pepfar, which contributes about 17% to its HIV/Aids programme in which around 5.5 million people receive anti-retrovirals.",
      "In his executive order, Trump also accused South Africa of a \"shocking disregard of its citizens' rights\" and taking \"aggressive positions\" against the US and its ally Israel in its ICJ case.",
      "In addition to the aid freeze, Trump offered to help refugees from the Afrikaner community, who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers, to settle in the US.",
      "His stance has played into the hands of conservative Afrikaner lobby groups, including AfriForum and Solidarity, which want the government repeal what it calls \"race-based laws\" such as affirmative action and black economic empowerment.",
      "This chimes with views by Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who was born in South Africa. He questioned on X why Ramaphosa had \"openly racist ownership laws\".",
      "This is not the first time South Africa's land reform policy has drawn Trump's ire.",
      "In 2018, during his first presidency, he accused South African authorities of the \"large-scale killing of farmers\" and asked his then secretary of state to look into the matter of the government \"seizing land from white farmers\".",
      "While Trump's remarks sparked a backlash at the time, Dr Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, told the BBC there had \"never been this kind of radical action taken to the point of an executive order being signed\".",
      "With their relationship now in a precarious state - both countries are weighing up their next move.",
      "On the trade front, Donald MacKay, CEO of Johannesburg-based trade consulting firm XA Global Trade Advisors, said that while the US was one of South Africa's biggest partners, it was not its \"closest trading partner\".",
      "South Africa exports a variety of minerals to the US, including platinum, iron and manganese.",
      "It also the one of the largest exporters under Agoa, generating about $2.7bn in revenue in 2023, mostly from the sale of vehicles, jewellery and metals.",
      "\"Over the years, that relationship has waxed and waned. It's never been terribly strong [since white-minority rule ended in South Africa]. But at the same time, I think it also never deteriorated quite as much as it has in recent years and I don't think it's South Africa's fault,\" Mr MacKay told the BBC.",
      "But he admitted South Africa had done \"a lot\" in recent years to irritate the US.",
      "\"Those irritations get to accumulate and under President Trump\u2026 this is seen as an opportunity to put South Africa in its place.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden put the change in dynamics partly down to \"global shifts\" and \"new competition driving up against the US\" from the likes of China, India and Brazil.",
      "While experts spoke on the benefits of Agoa, which is coming up for review later this year, they agreed that the impact might not be as significant as some fear.",
      "Agoa was introduced in 2000 and it gives eligible sub-Saharan African countries duty-free access to the US for more than 1,800 products.",
      "Mr MacKay said he would be surprised if South Africa continued benefiting from this preferential agreement after the review.",
      "\"My instinct is, whatever the reason that Trump is upset with South Africa, at the moment Agoa would be the easiest mechanism to use to punish South Africa.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden added that even if agreement was not renewed, or South Africa ended up being excluded, those businesses currently benefiting from it would suffer short-term losses but would manage to bounce back in a few years.",
      "He said at the moment President Ramaphosa's government was opting for the diplomatic route - though the Trump administration's seeming lack of interest in diplomacy drastically reduced chances of success.",
      "This has probably not been helped by South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola blunt response on Wednesday to Trump's move, saying there was \"no chance\" that South Africa would withdraw its case against Israel at the ICJ.",
      "\"Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the world, and the rule of law,\" Lamola told the Financial Times.",
      "South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ramaphosa, in his capacity as G20 president, has announced he will be sending a delegation around the world to clarify South Africa's domestic and foreign policies - with Washington being a key stop.",
      "South Africa assumed the presidency of the G20, a cohort of countries that meet to discuss global economic and political issues, in December last year, seeing it as an opportunity to bolster its international standing.",
      "But in a snub to South Africa, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that he will not attend a G20 meeting of foreign ministers taking place next week in Johannesburg.",
      "\"My job is to advance America's national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism,\" he said.",
      "South Africa is part of Brics, and alliance of major developing countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China, that is attempting to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier nations of North America and Western Europe.",
      "Mr MacKay believes it will be difficult for South Africa and other nations to navigate relations with the US under \"the most unpredictable politician in the world\", suggesting that they will have to increasingly see Brics as an alternative partner.",
      "But significantly for South Africa, the European Union (EU), one of its largest trading partners, has reaffirmed its support for the country.",
      "Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council - which sets the general political direction and priorities of the EU - posted on X on Monday that he had spoken to Ramaphosa by phone to highlight the \"EU's commitment to deepen ties with South Africa\".",
      "Should South Africa's charm offensive fail, Mr Van Heerden suggests the government could opt to \"negotiate hard\" and use the minerals it supplies to the US as a \"bargaining chip\".",
      "But he voices a warning: \"South Africa is going to have to think very carefully about how they play this chess game [where] the opening gambit has already been made by President Trump and Elon Musk.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 22:18:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Despite the high demand for domestic workers, they remain India's most vulnerable and exploited people.",
    "story": [
      "Smitha (not her real name), a domestic helper in Delhi for 28 years, can't forget the day she was beaten in public by one of her employers.",
      "The woman had accused Smitha - a Dalit woman from the most discriminated against caste in Hinduism's entrenched social hierarchy - of stealing her daughter's earrings and then refused to pay her.",
      "\"After many requests, I confronted her in public. That's when she started abusing and hitting me. I held her hands to stop the abuse but the guards came and dragged me out of the housing society and locked the gate,\" Smitha says.",
      "She was eventually paid \u2013 a measly 1,000 rupees [$11; \u00a39] for a month of sweeping, mopping and washing dishes \u2013 after a more sympathetic family intervened on her behalf. But she was banned from entering the housing community and did not bother going to the police as she believed they would not take action.",
      "Smitha's story is one among hundreds of thousands of accounts of mistreatment, abuse and sexual assault reported by India's domestic workers. Most are women and many are migrants within the country, belonging to castes that are looked down upon.",
      "Last month, India's Supreme Court raised concerns over their exploitation and asked the federal government to look into creating a law to protect them from abuse.",
      "But this isn't the first time that an attempt has been made to create such a legal framework. Despite years of advocacy by various groups and federal ministries, no such law has ever been passed.",
      "Separate bills proposed in 2008 and 2016, aimed at registering domestic workers and improving their working conditions, have not yet been passed. A national policy drafted in 2019 aimed at including domestic workers under existing labour laws has not been implemented.",
      "Sonia George of the Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa), who was part of the task force that formulated the draft policy, calls it one of the \"most comprehensive policies for domestic workers\" yet, but says that successive governments have failed to implement it.",
      "As a result, India's vast army of domestic helpers must rely on employer goodwill for basics such as wages or leave or even a baseline of respect. According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million.",
      "\"We have a patronising relationship with the help and not a labour employment relationship,\" says Professor Neetha N from the Centre for Women's Development Studies.",
      "\"This maintains the status quo and is one of the biggest hurdles to regulating and legalising domestic work.\"",
      "As things stand, private homes are not considered to be an establishment or workplace, so domestic work falls outside the purview of social protections such as minimum wages, the right to safe working conditions, the right to unionise and access to social security schemes.",
      "At least 14 Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have mandated minimum wages for domestic workers and some federal laws, like India's anti-sexual harassment and child labour laws, include domestic workers in their scope.",
      "But there is very little awareness among domestic workers that they can take advantage of these provisions, Ms George says, adding that the nature of the profession also poses challenges.",
      "Workers are scattered and there is no mechanism to register or even identify them as they generally don't sign any kind of contract with their employers.",
      "\"We will need to set up systems to register domestic workers - getting over their 'invisibility' is a big step towards regularising the profession,\" she says.",
      "That applies to employers too. \"They are completely invisible in the system and hence escape accountability and responsibility,\" Ms George says.",
      "The caste system also poses further complexities - workers from some castes may agree to clean toilets in a home while others from slightly different castes may not.",
      "Ultimately the whole concept of domestic work should be redefined, Ms George says. \"Domestic work is considered to be unskilled work but that is not the case in reality. You cannot care for a sick person or cook a meal without being skilled,\" she adds.",
      "In addition to failing to pass its own laws or implement its own policy, India has also not yet ratified ILO's Convention 189 \u2013 a landmark international agreement that aims to ensure that domestic workers have the same rights and protections as other workers. Despite voting in favour of the convention in 2011, India does not yet conform to all its provisions.",
      "India has a \"moral obligation\" to conform to the ILO convention, Ms George says. She adds that having a law will also help regulate private recruitment agencies and prevent the exploitation of domestic workers who go abroad to work.",
      "Last year, the wealthy Hinduja family made headlines after a Swiss court found them guilty of exploiting their domestic workers. The family was accused of trafficking vulnerable Indians to Switzerland and forcing them to work in their mansion for excruciatingly long hours without proper pay. The family's lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict.",
      "Perhaps the simplest explanation for decades of inaction in the face of a tide of abuses lies in the conflict of interest such regulation poses for India's decision makers, Ms George suggests.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the people at the table who have the power to sign off on a bill or a law are also employers of domestic workers and the ones who benefit from the status quo,\" she says. \"So, for any real change in the system, we first need a change in our mindset.\"",

    "title": "Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "title": "Legal showdown looms as Trump tests limits of presidential power",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "A judge accused the Trump administration of defying his orders, setting up a battle that could end up at the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "In the first weeks of his second term, President Donald Trump has wasted no time in flexing his political muscle. That much is clear.",
      "Since taking office in January, he has ordered the suspension of all new asylum claims, cancelled refugee resettlement, frozen government hiring and spending, gutted agencies established by Congress, moved to ban gender transition care for teenagers and offered a buyout deal for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",
      "The whirlwind of unilateral action on his campaign promises has pushed the limits of presidential power \u2013 and prompted legal challenges from Democrats, unions and legal groups.",
      "So far the federal courts have been the only substantive roadblocks to Trump's agenda, as judges have temporarily suspended some of his most contentious actions, including a bid to end automatic citizenship for anyone born on US soil - a right established from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.",
      "But Trump is pressing on - and seems headed for a showdown with the judiciary that could eventually end in the highest court in the land. This week, a Rhode Island judge said the Trump administration was clearly and openly defying his court order to unfreeze billions in federal funds. The White House responded by saying that \"every action\" the president took was \"completely lawful\".",
      "Vance questions authority of US judges to challenge Trump",
      "Judge blocks Trump plan to put thousands of USAID staff on leave",
      "Judge blocks Trump's bid to restrict birthright citizenship",
      "If Trump's orders do reach the US Supreme Court, six of the nine justices there - including three appointed by Trump in his first term - are conservative. Just last term, the court issued a decision holding Trump, and all future presidents, largely immune from prosecution for official actions while in office.",
      "At the time, it was a landmark expansion of presidential authority. But some observers have suggested that Trump's latest moves could be part of a strategy to expand his powers even further.",
      "Trump's move to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and dismantle the United States Agency for International Aid (USAID), on their face, run afoul of the checks-and-balances system of US government.",
      "Congress, rather than the White House, holds the authority to control federal spending and taxation - what's known as \"the power of the purse\". Legislators also established USAID and lawsuits have been filed arguing that Trump has no legal authority to dismantle it and refuse to spend funds allocated by Congress.",
      "But if the high courts agree to uphold some of his sweeping executive actions, it could strengthen his ability to transform the government and enact policy changes without the help of Congress.",
      "And even if the courts rule against the president, says Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional expert at the Manhattan Institute, those legal defeats might be politically advantageous.",
      "\"There could be political benefits to being challenged in court and then even losing in court because then you can run against judges and make political hay of it.\"",
      "There is another scenario, however. Trump could simply refuse to comply with any court that tries to stop his exercise of unfettered presidential power.",
      "In Oval Office comments on Tuesday, the president hinted that this might be an option, in his typically oblique way.",
      "\"We want to weed out the corruption,\" Trump said. \"And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don't want you to do that.\"",
      "\"Maybe we have to look at the judges,\" he continued. \"I think it's a very serious violation.\"",
      "On Sunday, Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, was even more blunt.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he posted on the social media site X. That view was similar to one Vance expressed in a 2021 podcast, when he said that if Trump returned to power he should refuse to comply with any court order that prevented him from firing federal workers.",
      "Directly defying a court ruling, however, would cut against centuries of US history and amount to the opening skirmishes in a constitutional crisis that pits the president against the branch of government designed to establish and interpret the law of the land.",
      "\"My read is that President Trump is testing the outer boundaries of what he might be able to get away with, doing a lot of things that are blatantly against the law and maybe some things that are closer to the line,\" said Fred Smith, a professor at the Emory University School of Law.",
      "\"They are breaking a lot of norms,\" Mr Smith added of the nascent Trump administration. \"Why he is doing that, only he knows fully. But he is doing it.\"",
      "So far, Trump and his allies have made aggressive comments about unfavourable court decisions in the public and in legal filings, but have yet to be sanctioned for disobeying a court. When Trump was the target of multiple prosecutions over the past four years, he frequently questioned the legitimacy of the presiding judges, but his courtroom lawyers adhered to the law and legal procedures.",
      "The federal judge in Rhode Island, who had placed a temporary hold on another Trump order to freeze some federal spending, did warn in court filings Monday that the administration was violating his temporary restraining order but stopped short of finding them in contempt.",
      "Conservative legal scholar Ed Whelan wrote on X that it would be \"extremely grave\" for the Trump administration to defy a federal court order.",
      "\"I'm open to the argument that truly extraordinary circumstances (the makings of a wild hypothetical) might justify defiance,\" Mr Whelan wrote. \"But in our constitutional system there should be an overwhelming presumption in favour of executive-branch compliance with federal court orders.\"",
      "Should Trump disobey, and therefore delegitimise, the courts, the decision could come back to bite him when the time comes for the president to see his own lawful agenda enforced, some legal experts say. Democratic states like California, for instance, might be inclined to ignore White House directives and federal laws they don't like - and Trump would be hard pressed to use the courts to bring them to heel.",
      "\"If the executive decides it will obey some court orders but not others, it will find it won't get any court orders that it wishes to obey,\" said Philip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University Law School. \"I just don't think they thought that through.\"",
      "When Donald Trump redecorated the Oval Office to his liking in January, he reinstalled a portrait of President Andrew Jackson that had hung on the wall across from the Resolute Desk in his first term.",
      "The seventh US president is remembered for a critical moment of defiance against the United States Supreme Court. When the justices decided a dispute between the state of Georgia and Cherokee Indian governments in 1832, Jackson did not seem interested in following its direction.",
      "Jackson allegedly said of the Chief Justice's ruling, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"",
      "Nearly 200 years later, Trump himself has found himself on his own collision course with America's judiciary."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:31:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's plans for tariffs risk raising prices for items from cars to canned food.",
    "story": [
      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",
      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:44:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, remembers one cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Mathew. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",

Kelce had famously tried to deliver a friendship bracelet to Swift when she played at Arrowhead Stadium, only to be thwarted.",

      "She was in the midst of her Eras Tour and had played a concert in Tokyo the same weekend. Swift made a mad dash from there to the airport, hopped a private jet to Los Angeles, and made it to Las Vegas with time to spare.

      "On the eve of the big game, Swift was spotted with musicians Danielle and Alana Haim at Gianna Restaurant.",
      "The big question swirling Sunday was not whether Swift would make it to the game, like last year, but what could happen if she found herself on the field afterward, celebrating Kelce's third straight Super Bowl title and fourth overall. That didn't happen.",
      "The 35-year-old Kelce has been noncommittal about playing next year, and some within the Chiefs organization are bracing for his potential retirement. Kelce has been laying the groundwork for his post-playing career, building a lucrative podcast with his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, and appearing on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other TV shows.",
      "Then there's the question of whether Kelce might pop the question. According to BetMGM, those willing to gamble on his plans could get 8/1 odds that Kelce would propose to Swift with a Chiefs victory.",

And when I got to be in a play, I was so happy. That was a big deal for me.\"",
      "The talent that made her a big deal is undeniable \u2013 a dynamic vocalist who convincingly took on the role of Aretha Franklin, one of the many portrayals garnering Erivo critical acclaim.",
      "Erivo performs Aretha Franklin's \"How I Got Over\" in the 2021 miniseries \"Genius: Aretha\":",
      "Asked if she recognizes how special her voice is, Erivo replied, \"What I think is most special is what I get back from people, the connections that get made. That's the thing I'm always looking for.\"",

      "Fans has posted online their own renditions of \"Defying Gravity.\" \"It's really fun that people have taken it and made it their own,\" Erivo said. \"And I'm glad that that moment brings so much joy to people.\"",
      "\"What do you think you brought to Elphaba?\" I asked.",
      "\"The vulnerability, her humanity,\" she said.",
      "\"What's that vulnerability for you personally?\"",
      "\"I think always wanting to do well and not wanting to fail, not wanting to let family down. Those are the insecurities. Finally owning how I look.\"",
      "\"What do you mean by that?\"",
      "\"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother. It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",
      "\"You're really close with your mom. You're not with your dad?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"As you've gone on to have more and more success and visibility, how much do you think about your dad?\"",
      "\"I don't necessarily think about him too much, only that I wish him well,\" Erivo said. \"When I was a teenager, [I was] very angry at what that relationship was. That sort of fractured relationship I have with him, I think, originally was one of the driving forces of, you know, you want to do well because you want to prove that you're good enough to be loved. But then, you have to start learning how to do it for you.\"",
      "\"What happened with your dad?\"",
      "\"We had a falling-out that just never repaired,\" she said.",

And I think that watching her do that made me do the same \u2013 you sort of are given the tools to be determined enough to go after your dreams.\"",
      "Her roles show range: Her portrayal of abolitionist Harriet Tubman in the 2019 film \"Harriet\" led to her first Academy Award nominations, for best actress and best original song, and secured her a place on the red carpet, where she speaks through another sort of language: fashion. \"I think they're the words without the words,\" she said.",

      "\"I think I tell people I'm a bit of a daredevil, that I am a kind rebel!\" she replied.",

    "summary": "Stephanie Courtney (Flo, the Progressive Insurance saleswoman), Dean Winters (Mayhem, of Allstate insurance commercials), and Deanna Colon (the unstoppable dancer in Jardiance diabetes drug ads) talk about their fame as pitch people.",
    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",

      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",

      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement.

Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",

      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",

      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",

      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",

      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",

      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",

    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",

All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 22:44:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The CDC says respiratory illness is now \"very high\" nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Levels of influenza nationwide are now at the highest they have been since the peak of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, according to figures published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, amid this winter's second wave of the virus.",
      "Close to 8% of visits for respiratory illness to outpatient providers, including urgent cares and doctors offices, reported to the CDC this week were people sick with influenza. That is the worst on record in the CDC's influenza surveillance network since late 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.",
      "While most flu seasons usually see a resurgence of infections after the winter holidays, this winter's flu wave has now reached unusually high levels compared to recent years.",
      "That has driven overall levels of respiratory illness to \"very high\" levels for the first time this season, despite a smaller and now-decreasing wave of COVID-19 in recent months.",
      "Other influenza metrics are also far above recent peaks nationwide, including in emergency rooms and from testing laboratories. Data collected by the CDC from labs found 31.6% of tests last week were positive for influenza, close to double the 18.2% at last season's peak.",
      "The CDC says that most states are at \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of influenza activity, though some states may have now reached their peak.",
      "Influenza infections are \"likely growing\" in 15 states, the agency's disease forecasters predict, and are either now flat or starting to decline in most other states.",
      "One of the states where influenza is \"likely growing\" is Kentucky, where pediatric infectious specialist Dr. Kris Bryant says she's seeing \"extraordinarily high numbers\" of positive cases in children. At Norton Children's Hospital, there were 3,000 positive cases just last week, she said, calling the uptick \"worrisome.\"",
      "\"We tend to focus on flu as a respiratory viral illness, but some parents don't realize that it can cause seizures, even rarely an inflammation of the brain, and pediatricians are reporting cases of that across the U.S.,\" Bryant said.",
      "Flu vaccination rates in children is at its lowest level in six years, according to the CDC. This year, fewer than half of Americans have been vaccinated. Bryant suspects \"vaccine hesitancy\" could be playing a role in the trend.",
      "Unlike the 2009 pandemic, lab tests around the country suggest cases are still from the usual seasonal variants of the virus, and not a new strain that has spilled over from animals.",
      "While farms have been grappling with a record surge of H5N1 bird flu in poultry driving up egg prices, and a new potentially lethal strain in dairy cows, only a handful of human cases have been confirmed from bird flu in the U.S. Investigations have linked cases to direct contact with sick animals, not human-to-human transmission.",

    "summary": "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",
      "It is now unclear to co-authors of the bird flu research outside the agency when the research will ever be published, weeks after it was ready to go.",
      "\"The study is completed and was to be published in MMWR last month until the order from the new administration halted communication from CDC,\" K. Fred Gingrich II, executive director of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, said in an email.",
      "The association had worked with Ohio's health department and the CDC to sample\u00a0the blood of veterinarians who treat cows at an annual conference late last year, looking for antibodies that would help answer an outstanding question: had bird flu cases infected veterinarians under the radar?",

      "The announcment came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by reciprocal tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",

      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's\u00a0five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday.

      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",
      "Other ways to save on eggs include using store circulars, or buying them with a cash-back credit card. \"Then you're combining multiple ways to reduce your bill,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Inflation accelerated in January, rising 3% on an annual basis, indicating that the Federal Reserve's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has stalled out, at least temporarily.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Consumer Price Index was forecast to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.5%, versus economists' forecast for a 0.3% increase, according to FactSet. That's the biggest monthly jump since August 2023. It may be due to price increases set at the start of the year by many businesses, noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email.",
      "The report, which marks the fourth consecutive month of higher inflation, showed that the following items saw price increases on a month-over-month basis.",

      "What economists say",
      "Recent sticky inflation data backs the Federal Reserve's decision last month to hit the brakes on additional rate cuts, economists say. On Feb. 11, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that the central bank does \"not need to be in a hurry\" to pare rates further.",
      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "Because tariffs are essentially taxes on imports that are largely passed through to U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump's import duties, if enacted, could push inflation higher in 2025, economists are forecasting.",
      "What it means for your money",
      "Higher borrowing costs for longer: With the Fed pausing on additional rate cuts, consumers are likely to pay more for loans and other debt, ranging from credit cards to auto loans.",
      "\"Today's stronger than expected CPI release is likely to further cement the [Federal Reserve's] cautious approach to easing,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"We think the Fed is likely to remain in 'wait and see mode' for the time being and anticipate the Fed staying on hold at next month's meeting.\"",
      "Mortgage rates also aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Despite Fed cuts in 2024, mortgage rates remain near 7%, or close to a 20-year high. Mortgage rates haven't followed the arc of the Fed's rate cuts because they're based on economic data as well as the 10-year Treasury yield.",

    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",
      "A month later, he apologized for his apology, saying the words were not his own.",

    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",
      "Negative publicity over the incident, which was caught on video and widely shared over social media, embarrassed the company and led to its now abandoned open-door policy.",

      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\" for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\"Maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn't scalable or sustainable,\" Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\"",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on aluminum could make Coca-Cola more expensive.",

      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even more sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

      "The CFPB is an independent government agency established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. President Trump named Russell Vought, the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB on an acting basis after firing its previous director.",
      "Over the weekend, Vought\u00a0ordered\u00a0the bureau's staff to halt almost all of their work, continuing the administration's ongoing blitz of the federal bureaucracy. Vought directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications.",
      "In one of its lawsuits, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 155,000 federal employees across three dozen agencies and departments, asked the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to rule that Vought's directive that CFPB employees halt work is unlawful. The lawsuit cited Musk's Feb. 7 post on X, in which he wrote \"CFPB RIP\" with an emoji of a tombstone.",
      "\"CFPB employees have been placed in questionable status as they have been directed not to work but they have also not been formally placed on any authorized type of leave,\" the NTEU said. \"It is substantially likely that these initial directives are a precursor to a purge of CFPB's workforce, which is now prohibited from fulfilling the agency's statutory mission.\"",
      "The union asked the court to \"[declare] that Defendant Vought's directive to the CFPB's employees to stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful\" and \"[e]njoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB's supervision and enforcement work.\"",
      "The\u00a0second NTEU lawsuit suggests the administration has violated the Privacy Act, which prohibits CFPB from disclosing employee records, by granting DOGE access \"without employee consent.\" The suit asks the federal court in D.C. to stop CFPB from granting DOGE access to those records.",
      "\"CFPB has a statutory responsibility to protect the information that it collects and maintains about its employees from unlawful disclosure to third parties,\" the suit said. \"The Bureau has acted contrary to law and regulation by granting DOGE and its members access to the records that the Bureau collects and maintains about every CFPB employee.\"",
      "The CFPB was established through the Dodd-Frank Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in July 2010. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, spearheaded the CFPB's creation.",
      "The CFPB has been a sore point for conservatives ever since its founding, with GOP lawmakers saying it has issued burdensome regulations and rules. Supporters of the bureau point out that it has returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers through its enforcement actions.",
      "A 2024 Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of CFPB's funding structure, after challengers argued that its funding mechanism violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause. The court determined in a\u00a07-2 decision\u00a0that CFPB's funding structure complies with the Constitution.",

      "President Trump's firing of a member at the National Labor Relations Board leaves the federal agency unable to perform its duties protecting the rights of U.S. workers and monitoring union elections, according to labor experts.",
      "The agency is now down to two members, one below the minimum required to fully function, labor attorneys said, even as one of the country's largest companies, Amazon, presses the NLRB to void the results of a recent union election due to the board's downsizing.",
      "\"Right now the NLRB is not operational because there are only two out of five board members and the Supreme Court has ruled that they cannot operate with less than three members,\" Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab. and a former field attorney for the NLRB, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Congress set up the\u00a0NLRB\u00a0in 1935, during the Great Depression, to safeguard employee rights to collective bargaining. It oversees secret-ballot union elections and works to prevent and address unfair labor practices by private-sector employers and unions.",
      "Illegal firing?",
      "The Jan. 27 ouster of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox came as a shock and left the independent federal agency without the required number of members to function.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News\u00a0in an interview\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Wilcox is suing Mr. Trump, alleging the president exceeded his authority in firing her and requesting that she be reinstated as an NLRB member. Her firing runs counter to a \"Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies,\" according to the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "The president's bid to oust her from her Senate-confirmed position is \"unlawful and unprecedented,\" Wilcox said in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0 \"When Congress established the National Labor Relations Board almost 90 years ago, it made sure that the law would protect its independence from political influence. My removal, without cause or process, directly violates that law.\"",
      "Appointed to the NLRB in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in September 2023 to serve another term through 2028, Wilcox was told in a letter that she had not performed \"in a matter consistent with the objectives\" of the president.",

      "Some of the NLRB's day-to-day work can continue, but the board itself \"can't order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union,\" said Matthew Bodie, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"There are some people who are concerned that the Trump administration will take its time to fill those three positions, or not fill them at all, so it renders the agency toothless at some level.\"",
      "\"We've never had this particular situation where it's been rendered inoperative for lack of a quorum and what that means for workers,\" added John Logan, a labor historian and professor at San Francisco State University's Lam Family College of Business. \"Do they exist only if there's a bureaucratic framework to enforce them?\" he asked of the legal protections granted workers.",
      "Whole Foods union effort in jeopardy",
      "The NLRB's lack of a quorum is reason to overturn the results of a Jan. 27 election that had workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia\u00a0voting to unionize, the Amazon-owned grocery chain said in\u00a0objections\u00a0filed with the NLRB on Monday.",
      "Whole Foods has accused the local union of not playing by the rules.",

      "\"It's similar to what they filed in other Amazon cases around the country,\" UFCW Local 1776 President Wendell Young IV told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This company is going to take advantage of Trump cleaning house,\" Young said.",
      "Amazon and Whole Foods are delaying in hopes of getting a business-friendlier NLRB, or \"that ultimately the Supreme Court will have a different view than past courts,\" he added of lawsuits filed by Amazon and Elon Musk's SpaceX challenging the NLRB's structure as unconstitutional.",

    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles secured the championship in Sunday's Super Bowl 59, but there were also several winners \u2014 and plenty of losers \u2014 in the lineup of star-studded commercials that aired during the broadcast. The best Super Bowl LIX ads delivered strong messages, either through humor or drama, while the worst commercials left some viewers befuddled, experts said.",
      "There's a lot on the line for Super Bowl advertisers, with a few ad spots selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. Last year, a 30-second spot\u00a0sold for about $7 million. Advertisers also spend additional millions on creating their ads, often hiring well-known actors or celebrities to appear in their spots.",
      "Super Bowl commercials that score can pay off for a company through new customers and a stronger brand image, but ads that fumble can tarnish a business's marketing message and even turn off consumers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who co-runs its annual Super Bowl ad ranking.",
      "The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\"That's the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\" Calkins said. \"Safe advertising isn't the advertising you notice or remember.\"",
      "This year's crop of ads included some that dropped the ball, according to Northwestern marketing professor Derek Rucker, who co-runs the Kellogg ad review with Calkins.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Coffee Mate",
      "One of this year's worst ads was the spot from Coffee Mate, Kellogg's ad review found. That spot featured two men sitting on the couch when one of them puts Coffee Mate's cold foam on his drink. His tongue then leaps out of his mouth and dances along to music and fireworks.",
      "\"The brand showcased dancing tongues, which included jumping out of a person's mouth,\" Rucker told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The spot was distracting and the brand's message got lost as a result, he said.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Tubi",
      "Another commercial that was voted as one of this year's worst by the panel was the Tubi ad, Rucker said. That spot, for the Tubi streaming service, featured people with fleshy hat-like appendages, with the main character born with a cowboy-shaped head. The ad was \"good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,\" according to Collider.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: ChatGPT",
      "ChatGPT's ad was also a low-rated ad, according to Northwestern's ad panel. Its spot showed the evolution of human tech through black-and-white pixelated images, but the business school gave it poor marks because it didn't show viewers anything new. The ad cost $14 million to air in the first half, according to tech publication The Verge.",
      "\"It's understandable given that, with the amount of money invested in the spot, the audience really was given very little new information about ChatGPT. It's almost as if it simply showed up the party not knowing what to do,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Michelob Ultra",
      "This spot features actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara as they hustle younger players out of their Michelob Ultra beers by wagering that they can beat them at pickleball. \"Play you for an Ultra?\" O'Hara asks at the end of the commercial.",
      "\"Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara appeared together and showcased their hustle\u2014 and hustling\u2014 for Michelob Ultra. It's got just the right balance between brand and celebrity, and it resonated with our panel,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Google",
      "The Google ad featured a dad preparing for a job interview, who turns to Google's Gemini AI app to help him craft a description of the most challenging job he's had \u2014 being a dad.",
      "\"Google once again impressed our panel with a spot that showcased both the functionality of its phone and added its own emotional twist,\" Rucker said.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota announced on Thursday that she will not run for reelection next year, leaving another currently Democrat-held seat open ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Not long after Smith's declaration, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan announced her intention to run for the Senate.",
      "\"This job has been the honor of a lifetime. For the rest of my term, I'll work as hard as I can for Minnesotans and our country,\" Smith said in a video posted to social media.",
      "In the video, Smith said \"this decision is not political, it is entirely personal.\"",
      "\"After 20 years of hard and rewarding work in the public sector, I'm ready to spend more time with my family,\" she added.",
      "Smith said she plans to \"use every single day\" of her remaining term \"working as hard as I can to represent your interests in the United States Senate and make sure that your voices are heard.\"",
      "She also said \"we have a deep bench of political talent in Minnesota \u2014 a group of leaders that are more than ready to pick up the work and carry us forward, and I'm excited to make room for them to move forward.\"",
      "Flanagan announced her intentions on social media, saying she'll make a formal announcement later this month. She also praised Smith's work in the Senate.",
      "\"Senator Smith has paved the way for so many women like me throughout her entire career. She uses her voice to fiercely defend the people of Minnesota. She's fought for small businesses, farmers, and those who've been overlooked so they can have a fair shot at economic success,\" Flanagan said. \"Senator Smith is also an organizer at heart. She knows we all do better when everyone has a seat at the table. Thank you, Tina, for your leadership. I look forward to continuing our work together for Minnesotans.\"",
      "Late last month, Democratic Michigan Sen. Gary Peters said he wouldn't seek reelection, opening up a key seat in a battleground state.",
      "Smith's background, path to Senate",
      "Smith has held the U.S. Senate seat since 2018; she was first appointed to the position after former Sen. Al Franken resigned due to allegations of sexual harassment. She then beat Republican Karin Housley in the special election that November and was reelected in 2020. Before taking on the role of senator, Smith served as the state's lieutenant governor for Gov. Mark Dayton. She also served as chief of staff for both Dayton and Mayor R.T. Rybak.",
      "Smith was born in New Mexico and moved to Minnesota in 1984. In her pre-politics career, she worked at General Mills and was later an executive at Planned Parenthood.",
      "Smith's colleagues react",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Smith's compatriot from Minnesota, released the following statement:",
      "\"It's been a privilege to work with Senator Tina Smith. I'm lucky enough to call her not only a colleague, but a true friend. Tina and I have been friends since long before our time together in the Senate. We have watched each other's kids grow up and been there for each other through life's ups and downs. As the only Senator to have worked at Planned Parenthood, Tina quickly became a leader in Washington in the fight to protect women's rights. Tina also bravely shared her own story as part of her work to strengthen mental health services for all Americans. Her quiet but effective governing style earned her the title the velvet hammer. While Tina and I will continue to work together for the next two years, our friendship and her legacy will last a lifetime.\"",
      "Franken thanked Smith on social media for her work.",
      "\"She's worked hard to make their lives better at every step of her career and has admirably served them in the U.S. Senate,\" Franken said. \"As DFLers, we are lucky to have a deep bench of people who are guided by Paul Wellstone's words: we all do better when we all do better. I look forward to supporting the candidate we nominate to work on behalf of Minnesotans in Washington.",
      "Minnesota DFL Party Executive Director Heidi Kraus Kaplan said \"no one has fought harder for Minnesotans and our values than Tina Smith.\"",
      "\"From reproductive freedom to workers' rights, Tina has been a relentless champion for the DFL principle that we all do better when we all do better,\" Kraus Kaplan said. \"The DFL will work as tirelessly as Tina does to ensure that her successor shares her commitment to Minnesota values.\"",
      "Minnesota GOP Chairman Alex Plechash said Smith's decision creates an opportunity for Republicans to take the seat.",
      "\"Tina Smith saw the political reality coming \u2014 Minnesotans are fed up with the failed, radical policies of the Biden administration and the Minnesota Democratic Party,\" Plechash said. \"From rising costs to surging crime, failing schools, and reckless overtaxation, Smith rubber-stamped Biden's disastrous agenda every step of the way. Her decision not to run is just further proof that Democrats know they can't defend their record in 2026 ... The Minnesota GOP is building the infrastructure to win in 2026. This race is an opportunity to flip this Senate seat, add to the growing Republican majority, and ensure Minnesota families have a voice in Washington that actually represents them.\"",
      "Minnesota state Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy called Smith \"a fierce force in the United States Senate.\"",
      "\"I count on her discerning courage and steadfast partnership in our day-to-day fight for Minnesotans,\" Murphy said. \"I am happy for Tina, Archie, and their family, and I'm committed to our continued work together.\"",
      "Rep. Angie Craig, a fellow Democrat, said Smith is \"a true public servant.\"",
      "\"Her work to lower the cost of prescription drugs, broaden access to mental health care, fight the effects of climate change and expand economic opportunity in rural Minnesota will be felt for generations,\" Craig said. \"And as women across the country continue to fight back against the attacks on our reproductive rights, her voice will be critical in the Senate over the next two years.\"",

    "summary": "America's trading partners keep their markets to closed to U.S. exports, White House says in ordering up plan to impose global tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing.",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcment came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by reciprocal tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has already unveiled tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. He paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a month after both countries vowed to increase border security. He also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",

    "summary": "The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, following weeks of questions surrounding whether the controversial nominee would win the Senate's approval.",
      "Senators voted 52 to 48 to confirm Kennedy. The vote fell largely along party lines, with one Republican \u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u2014 joining Democrats in opposing him. McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio, said in a statement that Kennedy \"failed to prove he is the best possible person\" for the post, while citing his record on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, 71, is a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist whose family has mythic status in Democratic politics. The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy launched his own White House bid in 2023. And although he initially sought the Democratic nomination, Kennedy changed his bid to independent, before dropping out to endorse President Trump in August.",
      "Before entering politics, Kennedy worked for two decades as president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a nonprofit. He also founded Children's Health Defense, which has launched legal challenges against vaccine requirements and approvals, and served as its chairman beginning in 2016. Kennedy is married to actor Cheryl Hines. He has six children.",
      "With his confirmation, Kennedy will be at the helm of the sprawling HHS department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "RFK Jr.'s path to confirmation",
      "After Mr. Trump picked Kennedy for HHS secretary, pledging on the campaign trail to let him \"go wild\" on issues relating to health, food and medicine, Kennedy's confirmation initially appeared to be on shaky ground. With controversial stances on vaccines and abortion, Kennedy garnered opposition from both sides of the aisle. Then, a pair of\u00a0confirmation hearings featuring tense exchanges with several senators did little to quiet concerns about his path to confirmation, with little wiggle room among Republicans to advance his nomination out of committee.",
      "As it became clear Kennedy would not find support among Democrats on the committee, the vote to advance his nomination came down to a single Republican \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 whose vote would tip the scale in either direction. Cassidy, a medical doctor, had expressed consternation over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "In a surprise move moments ahead of the committee vote, however, Cassidy said he would support Kennedy, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed \"that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship,\" speaking multiple times a month.",
      "\"He will be the secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner,\" Cassidy said.",
      "After Kennedy's nomination advanced out of committee, Republican opposition in the full Senate also appeared to dissipate. Two senators who are among the few Republicans who have voted to oppose any of the president's nominees, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, announced they would support Kennedy's confirmation this week. And on Wednesday, all Republicans voted to advance his nomination in a procedural vote that fell along party lines.",
      "The final vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary came after weeks of pushback by Democrats, who warned of the widespread impact Kennedy could have on the health system. Senate Democrats spent hours on the Senate floor vocalizing their opposition to his confirmation Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which was the committee that voted on advancing Kennedy's nomination, called him an \"anti-vaccine crusader\" and the \"least qualified nominee to ever be nominated for a position of this importance.\"",
      "\"Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle still have an opportunity to turn away from a dangerous path,\" Wyden said on Wednesday. \"If they do not, my view is their legacy will be tarnished by setbacks in science that will echo in America for decades.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote Thursday morning that he's \"proud\" that every Democrat will oppose Kennedy's nomination, arguing that if the Senate held a vote on Kennedy under a secret ballot, \"Mr. Kennedy would never come close to becoming confirmed.\"",
      "\"Many if not most Republicans would vote against him,\" Schumer continued. \"But sadly and unfortunately for America, Republicans are being strong-armed by Donald Trump and will end up holding their nose and voting to confirm Mr. Kennedy.\"",
      "In his statement explaining why he voted against Kennedy, McConnell cited his history with polio, saying that in his lifetime he's \"watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world.\" The former GOP leader added that he \"will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures.\"",
      "\"Individuals, parents, and families have a right to push for a healthier nation and demand the best possible scientific guidance on preventing and treating illness,\" McConnell said. \"But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts.\"",
      "During his opening statement to the Senate Finance Committee last month, Kennedy said that \"Americans' overall health is in a grievous condition,\" citing high obesity, diabetes and cancer rates, among other conditions on the rise, while pledging to deliver on his and Mr. Trump's promise to \"make America healthy again.\"",
      "\"I promised President Trump that if confirmed I will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\" Kennedy said.",

He reiterated that point Thursday.",
      "\"Simply pointing out realism like the borders won't be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin,\" Hegseth said. \"It's a recognition of the hard power realities on the ground after a lot of investment and sacrifice.\"",
      "Biden administration officials, too, had cautioned against hopes for a full restoration of Ukraine's territory.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Linda McMahon, President Trump's nominee to become secretary of education, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Thursday as the future of the agency that she could potentially lead hangs in the balance.",
      "\"I would like to thank President Trump for his confidence in me to lead a department whose mission and authority were a special focus of his campaign,\" McMahon told the committee. \"He pledged to make American education the best in the world, return education to the states where it belongs, and free American students from the education bureaucracy through school choice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has long teased the possibility of closing the Department of Education, and he could be closer to making good on his pledge. Since taking office, the president has signed several\u00a0education-related executive orders\u00a0and multiple sources confirm he is\u00a0considering executive action\u00a0that would essentially dismantle the agency. This week, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, slashed nearly $1 billion in funding from the department and terminated dozens of contracts and grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\"Oh, I'd like it to be closed immediately,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. \"Look, the Department of Education is a big con job.\"",
      "Under questioning from independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the committee's ranking member, McMahon said the department could not be shut down without congressional action.",
      "\"It is set up by the United States Congress, and we work with Congress,\" she said. \"It clearly cannot be shut down without it.\"",
      "Ahead of her testimony, McMahon met with at least 19 senators, from GOP leadership to members of the HELP committee, including Chair Bill Cassidy, who said the pair had a \"productive\" discussion.",
      "\"She is prepared to return power to parents and reform an Education Department that has lost the plot over the last 4 years of the Biden administration,\" Cassidy posted on X.",
      "Sanders joined union members from the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers who rallied against McMahon's nomination outside of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.",
      "\"We understand that public education is the backbone of American democracy where all of our people come together to learn and to grow,\" Sanders told the crowd. \"Our job is not to destroy public education, it is to significantly improve it!\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent a letter to McMahon questioning her experience and policy views.",
      "\"You have a minimal track record on education issues and strikingly little experience pertaining to education policy,\" the senators wrote. \"This lack of a public record means that the American people have not been afforded the opportunity to evaluate your views on topics related to the Education Secretary's core responsibilities.\"",
      "McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO who served as administrator of the Small Business Administration during Mr. Trump's first term, has said she is \"committed\" to ensuring students have access to quality education.",
      "\"I look forward to working collaboratively with students \u2014   educators \u2014  parents and communities to strengthen our education system; ensuring every child regardless of their demographics is prepared for a bright future,\" McMahon said in a statement after she was nominated by Mr. Trump last November.",
      "Congressional Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump's threats to eliminate the Education Department, as some House members were physically locked out of the agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters when they attempted to meet with Acting Education Secretary Denise Carter last week. Layoffs at the department began on Wednesday.",
      "\"It's important for us to allow the Department of Education to continue to do its work,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a weekly news conference. \"That's the heart, soul and spirit of America.\u00a0 For the life of me, I can't understand why Republicans want to abolish the Department of Education. It's baffling to me. It's baffling to the American people, and we will continue to defend our public schools.\"",
      "Even if Mr. Trump moves forward with an executive order, legal and education experts say congressional action would be needed to fully eliminate the Department of Education.",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota introduced legislation last year that outlines a road map to abolish the Education Department and return control to the states. It would also redirect other federal agencies to oversee certain functions such as Pell grants and special education.",
      "Shortly after Republicans took control of both chambers in January, Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky introduced a one-sentence bill to terminate the agency by the end of 2026. Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, has introduced a countermeasure to protect the Department of Education.",
      "\"We will not take away opportunity for so many children,\" Hayes said. \"We will not eliminate Pell grants and all the programs that help people from low-income communities to go to college.\"",
      "\"I think, as the American people begin to understand, 'Oh, wait a minute, I didn't realize that's what this meant,' and that's across all the departments, I think that there's going to be public outcry and pushback,\" Hayes added, referencing Mr. Trump's desired cuts to the federal government.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson has declared \"the time has come\" to disband the Education Department and said Congress should codify the president's executive order, if enacted.",
      "\"We believe in the core principle that education is best handled by the people closest to the kids,\" Johnson explained. \"What does that mean? It means local school districts, local school boards. It means at the state level rather than the federal level. We think you empower parents when you do that. We give them more choice when you do that. So that's why we're advocates for school choice. That's why we're advocates for charter schools and innovative ideas. And I think you can return American education to a place of prominence and success if you allow those things to happen.\"",
      "President Jimmy Carter signed legislation in 1979 establishing the Department of Education. Federal funding accounts for less than 10% of the nation's public school funding, which is mostly financed through state and local taxes.

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 11:51:48 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge lifted a previous order pausing the program Wednesday. Soon afterward, the Office of Personnel Management announced the program was closed.",
    "story": [
      "Boston \u2014 A federal judge in Massachusetts allowed the Trump administration's bid to offer \"deferred resignations\" to federal workers who voluntarily leave government service to continue and lifted a previous court order pausing the program's deadline.",
      "Shortly after the ruling, Office of Personnel Management   spokesperson McLaurine Pinover said in a statement that the office was \"pleased\" with the court's decision and that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Wednesday. Roughly 75,000 federal workers have accepted the offer to leave their government positions, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. The White House had expected as many as 200,000 workers to accept the offer.",
      "Judge George O'Toole, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled Wednesday that the plaintiffs in the case \u2014 unions that represent federal employees \u2014 lacked standing to bring the case in the first place. He also ruled he did not have the jurisdiction to stop the program from proceeding.",
      "The judge initially paused the original Feb. 6 deadline for workers to accept the offer last week, and held a hearing on Monday over whether he should issue a temporary restraining order extending the pause.",
      "The Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, notified the more than 2 million federal employees last month that they had the option to resign their positions and retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30. Federal workers who agreed to resign would also be exempt from in-person work requirements through September and would not be required to work at their government jobs during the deferred resignation period, according to the notice.",
      "The message from OPM, bearing the subject line \"Fork in the Road,\" notified workers who did not accept the offer that the Trump administration could not give them \"full assurance\" about their continuing employment. OPM also noted that many federal agencies would be downsized \"through restructurings, realignments and reductions in force.\"",
      "Unions representing federal workers sued the federal government last week to stop the deadline and challenge the legality of the program, arguing it violates federal law. But in his ruling on Wednesday, O'Toole wrote the unions' alleged damages were not \"sufficient.\"",
      "He found that the plaintiffs were \"not directly impacted by the directive.\"",
      "\"They allege that the directive subjects them to upstream effects including a diversion of resources to answer members' questions about the directive, a potential loss of membership, and possible reputational harm,\" the judge wrote. \"The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork Directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others.\"",
      "O'Toole also wrote that aggrieved employees who might take issue with the deferred resignation program and its deadline are statutorily required to first challenge the program via an administrative \u2014 as opposed to judicial \u2013 review process.",
      "\"That the unions themselves may be foreclosed from this administrative process does not mean that adequate judicial review is lacking,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Pinover, the OPM spokesperson, said, \"There is no longer any doubt: the Deferred Resignation Program was both legal and a valuable option for federal employees. This program was carefully designed, thoroughly vetted, and provides generous benefits so federal workers can plan for their futures.\"",
      "Democracy Forward's Skye Perrymann said in a statement on behalf of the unions, \"We will continue to pursue all legal options to defend the civil service and protect the American people from extremism.\" The group is representing the labor unions that sued.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is part of a broader initiative undertaken by President Trump to slash the size of the federal government. The president issued several directives soon after the start of his second term last month that were aimed at reducing the federal workforce, including mandating employees return to their offices five days a week and reinstating an order that created a new category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of certain employment protections.",
      "He also tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk and DOGE employees have since targeted at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Treasury and Labor Departments.",

      "Huitema said that means his firing \"doesn't appear to be personal. I'm in good company.\"",
      "\"It really speaks, I think, an effort to, you know, kind of dismantle all of the institutions across the government that are set up, to serve as kind of an independent voice for integrity and for accountability,\" Huitema said.",

      "Huitema recalled that the Office of Government Ethics was created by Congress after the Watergate scandal led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. He said it was designed \"to take a nonpartisan, non-politicized, matter-of-fact, by-the-book approach and be that voice of integrity where it's needed.\"",
      "\"I do think it's true that, you know, my removal from this position flies in the face of that vision of Congress,\" Huitema said.",
      "Less than a year after Mr. Trump took office for his first term in 2017, Walter Shaub resigned as the head of OGE. Shaub said at the time that the presidential administration disregarded the \"norms and ethical traditions of the executive branch that have made our ethics program the gold standard in the world.\"",
      "Is Huitema worried that guardrails designed to protect the government from conflicts of interest are poised to fail?",

The attorney general also alleged during the news conference that New York's statutes unlawfully prevent state and federal law enforcement from enforcing immigration law.",
      "In a separate statement responding to the lawsuit late Wednesday night, Hochul called Bondi's news conference \"smoke and mirrors,\" because the Justice Department's lawsuit was \"a routine civil action about a law passed in 2019 that has been upheld by the courts time and again.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A group of eight former internal government watchdogs who were fired by President Trump filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging their terminations.",
      "The legal challenge, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C, argues that their firings violate federal laws meant to protect inspectors general from interference with their oversight duties. One of those laws, passed in 2022 with bipartisan support in both chambers, requires a president to give Congress 30 days notice before removing an inspector general and provide the \"substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons\" for the termination.",
      "The former inspectors general involved in the lawsuit worked at the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, State, Education, Agriculture and Labor, as well as the Small Business Administration. The lawsuit names the president and the heads of those departments and agencies as defendants.",
      "Inspectors general are nonpartisan and are tasked with conducting audits and investigations of the agencies they oversee to protect against waste, fraud and abuse. They have typically been appointed regardless of political affiliation and must be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"President Trump's attempt to eliminate a crucial and longstanding source of impartial, non-partisan oversight of his administration is contrary to the rule of law,\" they said in the 32-page lawsuit, which called the firings \"unlawful and unjustified.\"",
      "The watchdogs said that the agencies revoked access to their government email accounts and computer systems, and collected their equipment, such as government-issued phones and computers and access badges. The officials said they were also \"physically disabled\" from entering the government buildings where they work. Agency employees also arranged for the inspectors general to collect their personal belongings from their offices, the lawsuit states.",
      "\"These actions have had their intended effect of making it impossible for the IGs to perform their lawful duties,\" the lawsuit states. \"Because the purported removals were illegal and hence a nullity, the actions just described constituted illegal interference with the IGs' official duties.\"",
      "The watchdogs are asking the court to declare that their removals are void, which would mean that they are still duly appointed inspectors general of their respective agencies until the president removes them in compliance with federal law.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is Michael Missal, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs since 2016.",
      "\"My only guess could be they're trying to impact the independence that IGs have, because it makes no sense,\" Missal told CBS News Wednesday of his firing.",
      "Missal argues the firing threatens not only his paycheck, but the safety of veterans in hospitals and clinics nationwide.",
      "\"The work that we did protected veterans' lives and made the healthcare much safer for veterans,\" Missal said.",
      "Missal recently uncovered delays in medical appointments for veterans, including cancer patients in Buffalo. Other inspectors general flagged meat inspections that bypassed safety rules in California, and postal workers stealing credit cards from the mail, including near St. Louis.",
      "Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California argued the fired inspectors general failed to perform.",
      "\"Again, a new administration is acting quicker than any other administration in modern history,\" Issa told CBS News. \"But no, they need to be judged on who's the acting, who's replacing them, how fast they'll name those names, and will they be naming people who will aggressively look for waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Mr. Trump fired the internal government watchdogs on Jan. 24, four days into his second term. They were notified in a two-line email from the Office of Presidential Personnel stating that \"due to changing priorities your position as inspector general ... is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "The president told reporters late last month that the firings were \"standard\" and a \"very common thing to do.\"",
      "But the inspectors general argued in their lawsuit that Mr. Trump's claims are wrong, as presidents of both parties \u2014 including the president during his first term \u2014 refrained from removing the internal watchdogs that were in place by their predecessors.",
      "They also said that Mr. Trump has not communicated to Congress his intention to remove the inspectors general or provided a \"substantive rationale,\" as required by law.",
      "\"IGs must be watchdogs, not lapdogs,\" the lawsuit states. \"The deleterious consequences of the Trump administration's contrary approach are hard to overstate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to terminate the officials set off alarm bells in Congress. In the wake of his action, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and ranking member Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, sent the president a letter asking him to provide the legally required 30-day notice and reasons for their removal.",
      "Grassley sponsored the Securing Inspector General Independence Act of 2022, which laid out the requirements for getting rid of an inspector general.",
      "\"While IGs aren't immune from committing acts requiring their removal and they can be removed by the president, the law must be followed,\" Grassley and Durbin wrote.",
      "They added: \"This is a matter of public and congressional accountability and ensuring the public's confidence in the Inspector General community, a sentiment shared more broadly by other members of Congress. IGs are critical to rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct within the Executive Branch bureaucracy, which you have publicly made clear you are also intent on doing.\"",
      "The lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's removal of the watchdogs is one of more than four dozen that have been filed in courts from coast to coast against the administration.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump held a lengthy phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday and directed members of his national security team to \"immediately\" begin negotiations aimed at ending Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "The call between Mr. Trump and Putin was the first known conversation between the two since the president returned to the White House for a second term. It came a day after Russia released\u00a0Pennsylvania schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence and was considered by the U.S. to be wrongfully detained.",
      "\"I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia,\" the president wrote on Truth Social\u00a0Wednesday morning. \"We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Putin talked about the \"great benefit that we will someday have in working together\" and agreed on the need to end Russia's war with Ukraine. In addition to the pledge to begin discussions on the war, the president and his Russian counterpart said they would visit \"each other's nation.\"",
      "The president said he has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to lead negotiations on the war.",
      "Speaking in the Oval Office later in the day, Mr. Trump said the phone call with Putin lasted roughly an hour, and said the two leaders would likely meet in Saudi Arabia for their first sitdown of his new term. He told reporters that Putin \"wants peace\" and \"wants to see it end.\" Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon after his call with the Russian leader. Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X that \"[n]o one wants peace more than Ukraine\" and that Ukraine is \"charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace.\" Mr. Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social that the conversation with Zelenskyy went \"very well\" and said it's \"time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's conversation with Putin came shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed to undercut\u00a0key Ukrainian positions in eventual peace talks, including by ruling out eventual membership in NATO. Speaking ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contract Group about more aid, Hegseth said peace in the country must include security guarantees that \"should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "The defense chief also said Ukraine's goal of returning to its borders before 2014, when Russia first invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula, was an \"unrealistic objective.\"",
      "The president, too, has addressed the prospect of Russia maintaining control of Ukrainian territory its forces have occupied, suggesting in an interview with Fox News that aired Monday that Ukraine \"may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday.\"",
      "In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump also said he is \"OK\" with taking the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO off the table. \"I don't think it's practical,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump frequently claims that Russia would not have launched its invasion of Ukraine three years ago if he were president and vowed on the campaign trail to quickly bring an end to the war. Vice President JD Vance is set to meet\u00a0with Ukraine's Zelenskyy at a security conference in Munich that begins Friday.",
      "The president has been a vehement critic of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, prompting concerns from Kyiv that assistance would stop flowing with him back in office. He told Fox News that aid could depend on Ukraine agreeing a trade deal that gives the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" he said. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",

    "summary": "Dr. Lawrence Tabak was the health research agency's second-in-command.",
    "story": [
      "A top-ranking scientist at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Lawrence Tabak, was forced to retire this week, multiple people familiar with the move say, marking the highest-profile departure of a health official under the Trump administration so far this year.",
      "Tabak's retirement, which he told colleagues was effective Tuesday, ends a decades-long tenure serving at the federal medical research agency, including multiple years as the acting director of the NIH during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also served as the agency's top ethics official.",
      "An email circulated among NIH staff from Tabak did not explain why he was abruptly stepping down, which multiple people familiar with the decision said came earlier than he was planning. One person said he did not plan to retire until at least the fall.",
      "Tabak told one federal researcher that he said he \"found it necessary to retire today from federal service.\" A former colleague said Tabak, who should have been the second-in-command at the agency, had been excluded from key meetings.",
      "Tabak and spokespeople for the National Institutes of Health did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "\"He has helped shape important policy decisions at NIH over four administrations. He has guided NIH through complex issues and will be sorely missed,\" acting NIH Director Dr. Matthew Memoli said in an email Wednesday afternoon to NIH staff announcing the retirement.",
      "The departure follows years of intense scrutiny of Tabak from Republican lawmakers at multiple congressional hearings, when he faced questioning over issues like the agency's oversight of \"gain-of-function\" research on viruses, which can make them more dangerous and is supposed to be tightly controlled, as well as grants to the EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services found in a review of grants dating back to 2014 that the NIH missed opportunities to avoid paying for $89,171 in costs to the groups that should not have been allowed, like vague employee bonuses. It also faulted the NIH for not doing more to ensure its funds did not go towards gain-of-function research.",
      "Tabak's retirement also comes amid ongoing court battles over a decision last week to make steep cuts to the amount of money for facilities and administration costs that the federal government has agreed to pay for in medical research.",
      "A federal judge has for now temporarily blocked those cuts nationwide, pending further arguments in lawsuits brought by medical colleges, universities and state attorneys general.",
      "Several scientists have come out to praise Tabak, who was often tasked as the agency's principal deputy director to handle difficult problems at the NIH.",
      "\"Larry was brilliant at deflecting credit away from himself in order to raise up colleagues, mentees, and those who might otherwise have lacked a voice,\" posted Carrie Wolinetz, a former senior adviser to the NIH director.",
      "In addition to his administrative duties, Tabak also continued to lead a team within the NIH publishing biochemistry research.",
      "Jordan Lara, a research fellow in Tabak's lab at the NIH, praised him for having \"always made time\" for mentorship and scientific research.",
      "\"He would work 80 hours a week regularly with no days off. He truly gave himself up for the American public. it's absolutely insane to have him cast out like this and to paint him as anything other than a dedicated public servant,\" said Lara in a message.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 17:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Collectors said the value of certain pennies could rise if the U.S. Treasury stopped manufacturing the coin.",
    "story": [
      "Can a penny saved finally be truly worth it? Collectors are asking that question this week after President Trump ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to stop minting the penny.",
      "\"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\" Mr. Trump wrote in Truth Social post on Sunday. \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"",
      "Every penny costs 3.7 cents to manufacture and the U.S. Treasury lost $85.3 million in 2024 producing them, the U.S. Mint reported. Congress sets currency specifications, so it's unclear whether Mr. Trump has the power to eliminate the penny, but the president might be able to stop the Treasury from minting them.",
      "This is key, collectors say, to possibly driving up the price of 2025 pennies and rare pennies currently in circulation.",
      "\"As an avid collector of coins, the coin collecting community is excited as the discontinuation of the penny is a historic event and it brings a renewed interest in rare and valuable editions,\" avid coin collector Scott Evans told CBS News.",
      "He pointed to the rise in interest in Canada's penny after the country discontinued producing the coin in 2012 as a guide for collectors. The Royal Canadian Mint removed at least 6 billion pennies in the first three years after stopping production, depositing them at financial institutions and trucking them from coast to coast to recover their valuable copper and zinc, Canada's government said in a report analyzing its penny removal.",
      "Over 3.5 billion Canadian pennies were returned in the first year alone, and fewer pennies meant more value for the ones left behind. Some valuable pennies include coins from the 1920s \u2014 as most pennies from this decade are hard to find, the Canadian Mint said\u00a0\u2014 and from 1936, when only a few \"dot\" cents are known to exist, making them extremely rare.",
      "This is what bullish collectors hope to see if production stops in the U.S. Evans referenced coins with errors on them or coins with significant dates that might see a big increase in value. Before 1982, pennies were made of 95% copper and 5% zinc, and those made of precious metals might see an increase. He pointed to pennies such as the 1943 Copper Penny or the 1982-D Small Date Copper Penny that might jump in price.",
      "Rare coin and precious metal collector Jonathan Aminov told CBS News he doesn't predict a huge jump in price for the penny.",
      "\"I get calls about pennies all day long,\" said Aminov, who owns Big Apple Coins in Manhattan.",
      "He said the U.S. won't see a foreseeable shortage of pennies anytime because there are too many coins in circulation.",
      "Aminov said collectors might see interest in the 2025 penny because that was the year the coin stopped being minted. If 500 million pennies were ordered for the year and 50 million were minted, then those coins are going to be more desirable, he said.",
      "He also cautioned that it would be difficult to obtain big prices for pennies as the coin would have to be extremely rare saying, \"Pennies are a bit of a longshot.\"",
      "However, the end of penny production can bring new interest and collectors into a hobby that Aminov says could be a good thing. And once someone is hooked on coin collecting it's hard to get out, he says.",
      "\"It's easy to fall in love with coins,\" said Aminov. \"And the people who love it really, really love it. They spend obscene amounts of money to purchase their coin and then stare at it for hours in love with its beauty and history.\"",

    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

      "The White House considers fundraising for the center to be lackluster, two sources said. The dozens of people on the fundraising team raised more than $90 million last year, while the federal government contributed about $45 million. The rest of its budget came from ticket sales and other proceeds.",
      "According to its website, the Kennedy Center hosts over 2,200 performances, events and exhibits a year, with over 2 million visitors annually. The center was created by Congress in 1958 and serves as a living memorial to John F. Kennedy.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:01:14 -0500",
    "summary": "While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals and suspected gang members to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrant detainees who lack serious criminal records or any at all, according to two U.S. officials and internal government documents.",
      "When he ordered officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into a large-scale immigration detention site late last month, President Trump said it would house the \"worst\" migrants and \"provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "Administration officials have since touted military flights to Guantanamo that they said have transported migrants in the U.S. illegally who have also committed violent crimes like murder and rape, as well as alleged members of Tren de Aragua, the infamous gang that originated in Venezuelan prisons.",
      "Internal documents and interviews with U.S. officials indicate the administration has sent migrant criminals and alleged gang members to Guantanamo, detaining them in the post-9/11 maximum-security prison that also houses, in a separate section, more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "But in addition to sending those with criminal records or suspected or known gang ties \u2014 classified as \"high-risk\" detainees \u2014 U.S. officials have also transported migrants deemed to be \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, according to the government documents obtained by CBS News. More low-risk migrants are expected to be transported on Wednesday, alongside high-risk detainees, the documents show.",
      "Federal immigration authorities define low-risk detainees as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who have not been arrested or convicted of violent offenses or other serious crimes, government guidelines show. U.S. officials said they could include migrants who lack any criminal record but have been ordered deported because of civil immigration violations, like entering the country without proper documents.",
      "While the high-risk migrants have been detained in cells at Guantanamo's maximum-security prison, the low-risk detainees have been placed in a barrack-like facility known as the Migrant Operations Center that includes rooms with restrooms, according to the documents and one of the U.S. officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "The State Department has traditionally used the Migrant Operations Center to house asylum-seekers intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard, while they wait to be resettled in third countries.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed CBS News' reporting, including the separate housing arrangements.",
      "\"In addition to holding violent gang members and other high-threat illegal aliens, Guantanamo Bay is also holding other illegal aliens with final deportation orders. Every single alien at Guantanamo Bay has a final deportation order,\" the spokesperson said. \"All of these individuals committed a crime by entering the United States illegally.\"",
      "In two weeks, officials have made some progress in operationalizing Mr. Trump's instructions to establish the facilities needed to detain as many as 30,000 unauthorized migrants at the base in Guantanamo, a 45-square mile stretch of Cuban land that the U.S. has leased for over a century.",
      "Over the past week, U.S. service members at the base have been erecting tents to house migrant detainees beyond the prison and Migrant Operations Center, both of which have limited capacities.",
      "Officials have also been meeting the administration's goal of transporting groups of detainees to the base daily, sending eight military flights over the last nine days. The flights, however, have only carried up to 15 detainees each, due to limits on how many can be transported at one time when they reach the base.",
      "As of late Tuesday, nearly 100 unauthorized migrants were being held at Guantanamo, all of them adults from Venezuela, one of the U.S. officials said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said recently the detainees will be held there until they can be deported, but it's unclear when that could happen.",
      "In recent years, Venezuela's repressive government has generally rejected American deportation flights, citing the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. Under a recently brokered agreement with the Trump administration, Venezuela sent two planes to the Texas border earlier this week to pick nearly 200 of its citizens who were in U.S. immigration custody and transport them back to Venezuela. But similar flights to Guantanamo have not been announced.",
      "While some Republican lawmakers have praised the Trump administration for using Guantanamo to hold migrant detainees, the effort has alarmed pro-immigrant civil rights groups. They have accused the administration of using the naval base as a \"legal black hole\" to hold migrants \"incommunicado,\" demanding that the detainees be given access to lawyers.",
      "While the transportation of low-risk migrants to Guantanamo undermines statements from Trump officials that the facility would be used to house \"the worst of the worst,\" it also reinforces a message the administration has communicated repeatedly: no one who is in the U.S. illegally will be shielded from detention and deportation, even if they lack criminal histories.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of advocates led by the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday asking a federal court to quickly require the Trump administration to give the migrant detainees it is holding at Guantanamo Bay access to lawyers.",
      "Complying with an order from President Trump late last month, U.S. officials have been transporting dozens of unauthorized migrants to the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, using military aircraft. Administration officials have said the detainees will be held there until they can be deported.",
      "In its 29-page lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., the ACLU said those detained at Guantanamo have a right under the Constitution and federal immigration law to see legal counsel, and accused the Trump administration of holding them \"incommunicado.\" The group demanded that lawyers be given immediate access to the migrant detainees there, virtually and in-person.",
      "\"Sending immigrants to a remote island without access to attorneys is shocking, and if permitted by the courts, would set a dangerous precedent,\" Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who filed the lawsuit, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "The request for a temporary restraining order was filed on behalf of several relatives of migrants believed to be detained at Guantanamo, as well as four legal services providers in Texas and Florida that want to offer them representation.",
      "\"The government has announced its goal of sending tens of thousands of immigrants to Guant\u00e1namo in the near future,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Without this Court's intervention, even more immigrants will be transferred to this legal black box without access to counsel or any means of vindicating their rights.\"",
      "Asked for comment on the ACLU's lawsuit, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said there's \"a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers\" at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "\"If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers &\u00a0vicious gang members than they do about American citizens \u2014 they should change their name,\" McLaughlin wrote in an email.",

      "A Russian cybercriminal and crypto fraudster will be sent back to Moscow as part of a prisoner swap that on Tuesday brought American Marc Fogel home after more than three years in Russian custody.",
      "Alexander Vinnik in 2024 entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit money laundering. The 45-year-old operated BTC-e, at one point one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Prosecutors said BTC-e was a valuable tool for criminals looking to move or launder money. They said BTC-e pocketed $121 million from \"numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware attacks, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials, and narcotics distribution rings.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Vinnik would be exchanged for Fogel and would be returning to Russia.",
      "\"Vinnik was a nonviolent crypto criminal, and as part of this exchange, he has forfeited more than $100 million that he obtained in that illegal crime,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Vinnik was arrested in Greece in 2017, the first year of President Trump's first administration. British cryptocurrency analysis firm Elliptic claimed in a 2020 report that BTC-e may have been used to finance cyber attacks in 2015 and 2016 targeting the Democratic National Committee.",
      "The practice of using cryptocurrency to fund Russian cyber attacks was described in a report by special counsel Robert Mueller III, who investigated the country's efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. Mueller's investigation did not find the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government.",
      "Vinnik's name has since been included in a series of negotiations that led to prisoner exchanges between the U.S. and Russia.",
      "He was due to be sentenced in June 2025.",
      "Alameda County Santa Rita jail, the California detention center where Vinnik was being held, told CBS News that he had been released from custody there on Feb. 10.",
      "Vinnik's lawyers told CBS News in a statement that a recent hearing had taken place in federal court, but that they were unable to share more details.",
      "\"We can only note that professional legal defense, high-quality political analysis, and appropriate lobbying mechanisms can sometimes have a significant impact on the course of events,\" Vinnik's lawyer said. \"The sentencing in this case has been postponed multiple times, largely due to the political landscape, where certain administrative changes may play in favor of our client.\"",
      "Vinnik's lawyer earlier confirmed he was still in the U.S.",
      "His lawyers claimed in a 2023 court filing that the U.S. at one point offered to trade Vinnik in exchange for basketball star Brittney Griner, \"but the exchange took a different turn.\"",
      "Ultimately, the deal came for an American who had similarly watched as others from his country were sent home in deal after deal. Marc Fogel, a schoolteacher who had been held in Russia since 2021, stepped on U.S. soil late Tuesday night.",
      "The 63-year-old\u00a0whose family had tirelessly advocated for his release was brought to the White House, where he met Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, House Speaker Mike Johnson and other leaders.",

      "The defense chief spoke not long before President Trump announced in a social media post that he had agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, during a phone call with the Russian leader on Wednesday. He said he would be calling Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy immediately \"to inform him of the conversation.\"",
      "In remarks delivered ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to discuss further aid for Ukraine, Hegseth called Ukraine's goal of returning to its pre-2014 borders \u2014 before Russian forces first invaded and started seizing ground, annexing the Crimean Peninsula \u2014 an \"unrealistic objective.\"",
      "The U.S. defense chief said \"as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed\" to Ukraine.",
      "Furthermore, he said any peacekeeping troops deployed to Ukraine should not be part of a NATO mission, nor covered by Article 5, the alliance's mutual defense pact.",
      "Around 50 countries make up the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which has provided support for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.",
      "Hegseth said that, moving forward, Europe should \"provide the overwhelming share of lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine,\" and urged those in attendance at the Brussels summit to speak to their governments about increasing their defense spending, as the U.S. shifts its focus elsewhere.",
      "Hegseth says U.S. won't be \"primary guarantor of security in Europe\"",
      "\"I'm also here today to directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being the primary guarantor of security in Europe,\" Hegseth said, stressing that the U.S. would be focusing on its own border security and China.",
      "\"The U.S. is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity, and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail. As the United States shifts its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The Ukraine Defense Contact Group in total has provided Ukraine with over $126 billion in military assistance and weapons, the Associated Press reported. The United States has provided $66.5 billion of that and has chaired the group since its inception. It is unclear who will chair the next meeting.",
      "\"We hear you,\" the United Kingdom's Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's remarks.",
      "Mr. Trump promised that he would quickly end the war in Ukraine when he took office earlier this year, and he's often complained about it being too costly to U.S. taxpayers.",
      "In his remarks, Hegseth said the U.S. and Europe \"can establish a division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and the Pacific respectively,\" but that it \"will require our European allies to step into the arena and take ownership of conventional security on this continent.\"",
      "\"The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to partnership with Europe,\" Hegseth said. \"But the United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.

    "summary": "President Trump and other critics of the agency say it needs to be shut down. Supporters of the agency point to its record of protecting consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday, teeing up a final vote on his confirmation later this week.",
      "In a 53 to 47 vote, the Senate voted to clear the final procedural hurdle to Kennedy's nomination. The vote fell along party lines.",
      "Kennedy's path to confirmation was once considered among the most fragile of President Trump's nominees. The 71-year-old faced scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans alike in recent weeks, including during a pair of fiery hearings last month, where he was grilled over his controversial views on vaccines and abortion.",
      "The longtime environmental lawyer and activist launched a White House bid in the 2024 election, though he initially sought the Democratic nomination and has close ties to the party as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy. He dropped out of the presidential race to endorse Mr. Trump in August.",
      "Kennedy's nomination advanced out of committee last week, with the vote coming down to a single Republican. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor, had expressed consternation over his nomination because Kennedy has raised doubts about vaccines. Then, moments ahead of the committee vote, Cassidy said he would support him.",
      "Outside of the committee, Republican opposition to Kennedy's nomination has also appeared to dissipate. Sen. Susan Collins, who is among the few Republicans who have voted to oppose any of the president's nominees, told reporters Monday she planned to support Kennedy's confirmation. On Wednesday, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, another Republican often willing to buck her party, announced she would support Kennedy's confirmation as well.",
      "Democrats have strongly opposed the nominee to lead HHS. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued that the support among Republicans comes in response to pressure from the White House.",
      "\"The vote on RFK is about one simple question,\" Schumer said. \"Will Republicans do the right thing for American public health, or will they do whatever is necessary to keep Donald Trump happy, no matter how misguided he is?\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Kennedy in advance of the procedural vote, saying he looks forward to Kennedy being a \"partner to Congress on some very important issues,\" including chronic disease. And Thune said he's encouraged that Kennedy has \"committed to implementing President Trump's pro-life policies at HHS.\"",
      "\"Mr. Kennedy promises to make HHS a collaborative, transparent and science-driven agency under his leadership,\" Thune said, adding that Kennedy has committed to an \"unprecedented level of collaboration with Congress\" and \"regular and robust oversight of his agency's activities.\"",

    "summary": "The clouds contain carbon dioxide and only form high in Mars' atmosphere.",
    "story": [
      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",
      "The rover will continue on to a new location that includes what NASA called \"boxwork,\" or fractures in the planet's surface formed by groundwater. When seen from space, the fractures look like giant spiderwebs, NASA said.",

      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",

    "summary": "Endangered Mexican long-nosed bats are now being tracked via \"eDNA\" using their saliva.",
    "story": [
      "Flagstaff, Arizona \u2014 Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive.",
      "Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders.",
      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",
      "\"They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,\" Lear said."

    "story": [
      "An asteroid nearly the size of a football field now has a greater than one percent chance of hitting Earth in about eight years. Such an impact has the potential for city-level devastation, depending on where it strikes.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",

Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",

    "title": "NASA astronaut says \"we don't feel abandoned\" as space mission stretches on",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Butch Wilmore have not been \"abandoned\" in space, as NASA considers plans to speed their return.",
    "story": [
      "Contrary to a recent social media post from President Trump, Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore have not been \"virtually abandoned\" in space, despite a mission that's been extended from a little more than one week to more than nine months.",
      "\"I don't think I'm abandoned. I don't think we're stuck up here,\" she  told CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson during an in-flight  interview airing Friday night. \"We've got food. We've got  clothes. We have a ride home in case anything really bad does happen to  the International Space Station.",
      "\"We're in a posture ... where we  have the International Space Station fully manned and doing what the  taxpayers wanted, to do world-class science. And so I feel honored, like  I said, to be here and a part of the team.\"",
      "NASA is finalizing plans to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, around March 19, sources say. That would shorten their extended stay in orbit by about two weeks compared to a previous plan for late March or April.",
      "The slightly earlier trip home would be possible if the next set of station fliers, known as Crew 10, is switched to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as mid March. The switch is needed, sources say, because work to prepare the original SpaceX ferry ship for its maiden flight is taking longer than expected.",
      "In any case, after a weeklong handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams would undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the same Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams' return.",
      "Why the mission extended for months",
      "Assuming the dates hold up \u2014 and there are multiple variables in play \u2014 Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since their\u00a0launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week, the time needed to carry out the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.",
      "But the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and helium leaks shortly after launch that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could hitch a ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA initially planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but last December, another month was tacked onto the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch. Sources now say more time is needed to finish that work.",
      "Trump speaks out on crew's delay",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, saying in a social media post that he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\" He also named Musk, a billionaire\u00a0supporter of the Trump campaign, to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is charged with cutting the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk said in an earlier post\u00a0on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, was appointed by the Biden administration, but the decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission was made by the agency's Commercial Crew and International Space Station programs. The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "As such, there is no need to \"go get\" the astronauts \u2014 their ride home has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "\"We don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team.\"",
      "In the interview, Dickerson asked Williams about the president's comments on their mission.",
      "\"Trump said you and Butch Wilmore, who is your Starliner crewmate, had been \u2014 this is the president's words \u2014 'virtually abandoned,'\" Dickerson asked. \"Do you feel abandoned up there, commander?\"",
      "\"I don't think those words are quite accurate,\" Williams replied. \"Both Butch and I have lived up here on the space station before. We know how NASA and our commercial partners work together. So we expected that we would be up here for a little while.",
      "\"We're part of something bigger than ourselves. We're part of the International Space Station, and we have obligations to our international partners to do science and exploration while we're up here. So yeah, we knew this was going to happen, so no, we don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team, and that's a huge honor.\"",
      "Asked why the Crew 9 Dragon couldn't return to Earth sooner, given that it's already docked at the station, Williams said that would leave the station with a single U.S. crew member aboard, Don Pettit, who was launched to the station last year with two cosmonauts aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",
      "\"Things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside (or) outside, and so having additional people to be able to do that, that capability, is really important.\"",
      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",
      "NASA would not comment on the plans. A spokeswoman said \"we're not able to confirm any details reported on Crew 9 return at this time. We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

      "Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\" for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\"Maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn't scalable or sustainable,\" Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\"",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Google Maps: Gulf of America",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America's highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",
      "\"We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" Google said last month. The company added that its maps will reflect any updates to the Geographic Names Information System, a database of more than 1 million geographic features in the U.S.",
      "Google confirmed Monday that the Gulf of America name had gone into effect. Google Maps users in the U.S. now only see the Gulf of America name, whereas those in other countries see both names. Denali, however, still appears on both Google Maps and the GNIS.",
      "And the new names on Google Maps aren't the only change the company has made following recent actions from the Trump administration. Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",

      "Roman Berezhnoy, 33, and Egor Nikolaevich Glebov, 39, allegedly used ransomware software called Phobos to hack victim computer networks, copy and steal files and programs, then encrypt the original data, according to a news release from the DOJ. Once the original data was encrypted, the men and others involved in the scheme would allegedly extort the victims for ransom payments in exchange for keys that would allow the victims to access the data again.",
      "The men also allegedly threatened to expose stolen files, and allegedly operated a site on the dark web where stolen data was published. Victims of the scheme included a children's hospital, health care providers, and educational institutions, the Justice Department said. Victims lost data and money.",
      "Berezhnoy and Glebov were arrested Monday. Charges were announced Tuesday.",
      "Each has been charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, three counts of causing intentional damage to protected computers, three counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer, one count of transmitting a threat to impair the confidentiality of stolen data, and one count of unauthorized access and obtaining information from a protected computer.",
      "If convicted, each wire fraud-related charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Each computer damage count has a maximum penalty of 10 years. The remaining counts each have a maximum penalty of five years.",
      "The arrests come as international authorities announced a number of actions against cybercriminals.

      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",

Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",

      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcment came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by reciprocal tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",

    "summary": "The lawsuit claims that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the hippo attack his wife, the tour guides walked away without helping the couple.  The company denies the lawsuit's allegations.",
    "story": [
      "A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.",
      "Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit's allegations.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides - including at least one armed with a rifle - walked away without helping the couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died shortly after, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"We're doing this because this should never have happened,\" said Paul Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law partner, Nicole Coates. \"There are basic safety standards that businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences here were absolutely devastating.\"",
      "Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders' death and keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving interviews.",
      "The Manders, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children and a granddaughter.",
      "Phone and email messages were left for African Portfolio.",
      "The company's lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or reckless in connection with Lisa Manders' death. He said African Portfolio only arranged the couple's lodging and the owners of the lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.",
      "\"It's a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and is injured or killed. It's awful,\" Gould said. \"I think it's important to understand what African Portfolio's role in this is. It's a tour operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.\"",
      "He added, \"My client didn't conduct the safari. It arranged it. It booked all the components.\"",
      "Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa, because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manders signed for the trip.",
      "Email messages were left for Chiawa and its attorney.",
      "The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are \"inherently dangerous activities\" because of the unpredictability and sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent, qualified and trained to keep people safe.",
      "The suit alleges that African Portfolio \"encouraged and/or permitted\" the Manders to be exposed to an \"avoidable and highly dangerous encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.\" It also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe experience.",
      "African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the Manders before and during the attack, the suit alleges.",
      "Hippos are the world's second-largest land mammals after elephants, measuring about 11 feet long and about 5 feet tall, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs about 7,000 pounds.",
      "Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.",
      "In 2018, a Chinese tourist and a local fisherman were killed in hippo attacks in the same day in Kenya.",
      "Lisa Manders suffered \"significant premorbid fear and emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish\" before her death, the suit says. Craig Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily routines, it says.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and recklessness.",
      "\"He's suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on him and his life,\" Slager said. \"And he also has a claim for having witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is unthinkable. It's unimaginable.\"",
      "Last year, two American women were also killed by elephants in Zambia. In June 2024, officials said",
      "Juliana Gle Tourneau, 64, of New Mexico, was killed when an elephant that was part of a herd the tourists were watching attacked their vehicle in the Zambian city of Livingstone.",
      "In March 2024, Gail Mattson, a 79-year-old Minnesotan,\u00a0was killed during a game drive in Zambia's Kafue National Park. In that incident, an elephant charged a truck, flipped it over, killed the tourist, and injured five others.",

    "summary": "The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, following weeks of questions surrounding whether the controversial nominee would win the Senate's approval.",
      "Senators voted 52 to 48 to confirm Kennedy. The vote fell largely along party lines, with one Republican \u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u2014 joining Democrats in opposing him. McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio, said in a statement that Kennedy \"failed to prove he is the best possible person\" for the post, while citing his record on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy, 71, is a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist whose family has mythic status in Democratic politics. The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy launched his own White House bid in 2023. And although he initially sought the Democratic nomination, Kennedy changed his bid to independent, before dropping out to endorse President Trump in August.",
      "Before entering politics, Kennedy worked for two decades as president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a nonprofit. He also founded Children's Health Defense, which has launched legal challenges against vaccine requirements and approvals, and served as its chairman beginning in 2016. Kennedy is married to actor Cheryl Hines. He has six children.",
      "With his confirmation, Kennedy will be at the helm of the sprawling HHS department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "RFK Jr.'s path to confirmation",
      "After Mr. Trump picked Kennedy for HHS secretary, pledging on the campaign trail to let him \"go wild\" on issues relating to health, food and medicine, Kennedy's confirmation initially appeared to be on shaky ground. With controversial stances on vaccines and abortion, Kennedy garnered opposition from both sides of the aisle. Then, a pair of\u00a0confirmation hearings featuring tense exchanges with several senators did little to quiet concerns about his path to confirmation, with little wiggle room among Republicans to advance his nomination out of committee.",
      "As it became clear Kennedy would not find support among Democrats on the committee, the vote to advance his nomination came down to a single Republican \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 whose vote would tip the scale in either direction. Cassidy, a medical doctor, had expressed consternation over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "In a surprise move moments ahead of the committee vote, however, Cassidy said he would support Kennedy, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed \"that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship,\" speaking multiple times a month.",
      "\"He will be the secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner,\" Cassidy said.",
      "After Kennedy's nomination advanced out of committee, Republican opposition in the full Senate also appeared to dissipate. Two senators who are among the few Republicans who have voted to oppose any of the president's nominees, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, announced they would support Kennedy's confirmation this week. And on Wednesday, all Republicans voted to advance his nomination in a procedural vote that fell along party lines.",
      "The final vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary came after weeks of pushback by Democrats, who warned of the widespread impact Kennedy could have on the health system. Senate Democrats spent hours on the Senate floor vocalizing their opposition to his confirmation Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which was the committee that voted on advancing Kennedy's nomination, called him an \"anti-vaccine crusader\" and the \"least qualified nominee to ever be nominated for a position of this importance.\"",
      "\"Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle still have an opportunity to turn away from a dangerous path,\" Wyden said on Wednesday. \"If they do not, my view is their legacy will be tarnished by setbacks in science that will echo in America for decades.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote Thursday morning that he's \"proud\" that every Democrat will oppose Kennedy's nomination, arguing that if the Senate held a vote on Kennedy under a secret ballot, \"Mr. Kennedy would never come close to becoming confirmed.\"",
      "\"Many if not most Republicans would vote against him,\" Schumer continued. \"But sadly and unfortunately for America, Republicans are being strong-armed by Donald Trump and will end up holding their nose and voting to confirm Mr. Kennedy.\"",
      "In his statement explaining why he voted against Kennedy, McConnell cited his history with polio, saying that in his lifetime he's \"watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world.\" The former GOP leader added that he \"will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures.\"",
      "\"Individuals, parents, and families have a right to push for a healthier nation and demand the best possible scientific guidance on preventing and treating illness,\" McConnell said. \"But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts.\"",
      "During his opening statement to the Senate Finance Committee last month, Kennedy said that \"Americans' overall health is in a grievous condition,\" citing high obesity, diabetes and cancer rates, among other conditions on the rise, while pledging to deliver on his and Mr. Trump's promise to \"make America healthy again.\"",
      "\"I promised President Trump that if confirmed I will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\" Kennedy said.",

He reiterated that point Thursday.",
      "\"Simply pointing out realism like the borders won't be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin,\" Hegseth said. \"It's a recognition of the hard power realities on the ground after a lot of investment and sacrifice.\"",
      "Biden administration officials, too, had cautioned against hopes for a full restoration of Ukraine's territory. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said at the beginning of 2023 that \"for this year it would be very, very difficult to militarily eject the Russian forces from all \u2014 every inch of Ukraine and occupied \u2014 or Russian-occupied Ukraine.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Linda McMahon, President Trump's nominee to become secretary of education, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Thursday as the future of the agency that she could potentially lead hangs in the balance.",
      "\"I would like to thank President Trump for his confidence in me to lead a department whose mission and authority were a special focus of his campaign,\" McMahon told the committee. \"He pledged to make American education the best in the world, return education to the states where it belongs, and free American students from the education bureaucracy through school choice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has long teased the possibility of closing the Department of Education, and he could be closer to making good on his pledge. Since taking office, the president has signed several\u00a0education-related executive orders\u00a0and multiple sources confirm he is\u00a0considering executive action\u00a0that would essentially dismantle the agency. This week, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, slashed nearly $1 billion in funding from the department and terminated dozens of contracts and grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\"Oh, I'd like it to be closed immediately,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. \"Look, the Department of Education is a big con job.\"",
      "Under questioning from independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the committee's ranking member, McMahon said the department could not be shut down without congressional action.",
      "\"It is set up by the United States Congress, and we work with Congress,\" she said. \"It clearly cannot be shut down without it.\"",
      "Ahead of her testimony, McMahon met with at least 19 senators, from GOP leadership to members of the HELP committee, including Chair Bill Cassidy, who said the pair had a \"productive\" discussion.",
      "\"She is prepared to return power to parents and reform an Education Department that has lost the plot over the last 4 years of the Biden administration,\" Cassidy posted on X.",
      "Sanders joined union members from the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers who rallied against McMahon's nomination outside of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.",
      "\"We understand that public education is the backbone of American democracy where all of our people come together to learn and to grow,\" Sanders told the crowd. \"Our job is not to destroy public education, it is to significantly improve it!\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent a letter to McMahon questioning her experience and policy views.",
      "\"You have a minimal track record on education issues and strikingly little experience pertaining to education policy,\" the senators wrote. \"This lack of a public record means that the American people have not been afforded the opportunity to evaluate your views on topics related to the Education Secretary's core responsibilities.\"",
      "McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO who served as administrator of the Small Business Administration during Mr. Trump's first term, has said she is \"committed\" to ensuring students have access to quality education.",
      "\"I look forward to working collaboratively with students \u2014   educators \u2014  parents and communities to strengthen our education system; ensuring every child regardless of their demographics is prepared for a bright future,\" McMahon said in a statement after she was nominated by Mr. Trump last November.",
      "Congressional Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump's threats to eliminate the Education Department, as some House members were physically locked out of the agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters when they attempted to meet with Acting Education Secretary Denise Carter last week. Layoffs at the department began on Wednesday.",
      "\"It's important for us to allow the Department of Education to continue to do its work,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a weekly news conference. \"That's the heart, soul and spirit of America.\u00a0 For the life of me, I can't understand why Republicans want to abolish the Department of Education. It's baffling to me. It's baffling to the American people, and we will continue to defend our public schools.\"",
      "Even if Mr. Trump moves forward with an executive order, legal and education experts say congressional action would be needed to fully eliminate the Department of Education.",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota introduced legislation last year that outlines a road map to abolish the Education Department and return control to the states. It would also redirect other federal agencies to oversee certain functions such as Pell grants and special education.",
      "Shortly after Republicans took control of both chambers in January, Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky introduced a one-sentence bill to terminate the agency by the end of 2026. Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, has introduced a countermeasure to protect the Department of Education.",
      "\"We will not take away opportunity for so many children,\" Hayes said. \"We will not eliminate Pell grants and all the programs that help people from low-income communities to go to college.\"",
      "\"I think, as the American people begin to understand, 'Oh, wait a minute, I didn't realize that's what this meant,' and that's across all the departments, I think that there's going to be public outcry and pushback,\" Hayes added, referencing Mr. Trump's desired cuts to the federal government.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson has declared \"the time has come\" to disband the Education Department and said Congress should codify the president's executive order, if enacted.",
      "\"We believe in the core principle that education is best handled by the people closest to the kids,\" Johnson explained. \"What does that mean? It means local school districts, local school boards. It means at the state level rather than the federal level. We think you empower parents when you do that. We give them more choice when you do that. So that's why we're advocates for school choice. That's why we're advocates for charter schools and innovative ideas. And I think you can return American education to a place of prominence and success if you allow those things to happen.\"",
      "President Jimmy Carter signed legislation in 1979 establishing the Department of Education. Federal funding accounts for less than 10% of the nation's public school funding, which is mostly financed through state and local taxes.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 20:25:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Coverage of the recent mid-air collision brought up painful memories for John and Marilyn Kausner, whose daughter Elly was among those killed in the last major U.S. air disaster.",
    "story": [
      "Last month's mid-air collision near Washington, D.C., was the first fatal American commercial air disaster since shortly after 10 p.m. on February 12, 2009, when Colgan Air Flight 3407 fell out of the sky and crashed into a house near Buffalo, New York. It was the 14th fatal crash of a U.S. airliner in 15 years, but the 2009 disaster would become a turning point in American aviation.",
      "In the following years, the crash site was transformed into a memorial and place of reflection for the 50 people who died \u2014 49 on the plane and one person who was in the house. But for the families who lost loved ones \u2014 like John and Marilyn Kausner, whose 24-year-old daughter Elly was killed in the incident \u2014 the fight that started there never stopped.",
      "\"She was brilliant, she was beautiful and the life of the party,\" John said about his daughter.",
      "When the National Transportation Safety Board produced its report, it showed pilot error caused the plane to stall and nosedive. It was also revealed the pilot had not been forthcoming about failing prior flight tests.",
      "The findings spurred the families of the deceased into action. They banded together and lobbied the government to pass a federal airline safety bill, leading to a mandated 1,500 hours of flight training for co-pilots, the creation of a pilot performance database and a requirement that pilots have 10 hours of rest before flying.",
      "The Kausners brought along a posters of the victims on their trips to Washington, D.C., \"to put a face to the tragedy,\" Kausner said.",
      "Ron Aughtmon lost his uncle John Fiore, a veteran who dedicated his life to public service.",
      "\"We call each other the family we never wanted,\" Aughtmon said of the families of other victims. \"Not many people know what flight 3407 is, and our job is to make sure that we keep our loved ones and the fight for airline safety at the forefront.\"",
      "To this day, the families are still pushing to keep those regulations intact as regional airlines attempt to roll back pilot training requirements.",
      "The D.C. mid-air collision last month ended what had been the longest safety streak without a fatal crash in American commercial aviation. It had been nearly 16 years since the Colgan Air crash.",
      "\"When we saw it, it came back. It was rough, but we quickly thought about those families and what they are going through right now,\" Marilyn Kausner said.",
      "The 3407 memorial is a reminder of their loss and the change they fought for. Marilyn also says the other families affected by flight 3407 are now like her own.",
      "\"It's how I could be with her, and I believe it's why we were also successful because...we did it together,\" Marilyn said.",
      "It's a group they never wanted to join, but now one they can't live without.",

      "On Feb. Tuesday, he was sentenced to life in prison. Justice Riyaz Hamza, a judge in Fiji's Lautoka High Court, said that Dawson will have to serve a minimum of 18 years before he can be considered for a pardon, according to the Fiji Times.",

    "summary": "Hamas says it will adhere to the ongoing ceasefire in Gaza after threatening to delay the next release of 3 Israeli hostages.",
    "story": [
      "Hamas said Thursday that it would continue releasing hostages according to the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel, several days after it accused Israel of violating the agreement and said it would delay the next scheduled exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Under the terms of the deal between Israel and Hamas, which is a U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group, that exchange is set to take place on Saturday, with the release of three more Israeli hostages and dozens more Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"Hamas confirms continuation in implementing the agreement in accordance with what was signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timetable,\" Hamas said in a statement.",
      "Hamas said it had spoken to negotiators in Egypt and Qatar about, \"the necessity of adhering to implementing all terms\" of the the agreement with Israel, particularly relating to \"securing housing for our people and urgently bringing in caravans, tents, heavy equipment, medical supplies, fuel, and continuing the flow of humanitarian aid, as stipulated in the agreement.\"",
      "Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of breaching the agreement multiple times, but it has remained in effect, halting the 15-month war in Gaza sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that it had detected a rocket launch within Gaza, but that the weapon fell inside the Palestinian territory, and that the IDF remained \"committed to fully implementing the conditions of the agreement for the return of the hostages.\"",
      "The IDF said it had \"struck the launcher from which the rocket launch in the Gaza Strip was identified,\" but provided no further information. There was no immediate comment from Gaza's Hamas rulers about the rocket launch.",
      "On Monday, Hamas accused Israel of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement by not allowing the full amount of aid that had been agreed upon to enter Gaza and by firing on Palestinians trying to return to their homes in the decimated Palestinian territory. It said at the time that it would not free the next three hostages on Saturday as called for in the deal.",
      "Israel replied quickly, saying that if Hamas failed to release those hostages, it would resume its military operations in Gaza.",
      "President Trump went further, saying Hamas should free all of the remaining Israeli hostages \u2014 almost 80 people, though some are known to have been killed \u2014 on Saturday, or \"all hell is going to break loose.\" Israel never explicitly backed that suggested change in the ceasefire terms.",
      "Mr. Trump has also drawn a fierce backlash from regional partners and allies around the world for suggesting a plan to relocate Gaza's roughly 2.3 million Palestinian inhabitants to other countries, and for the U.S. to \"take over\" the territory and turn it into a real estate development.",
      "CBS News' team in Gaza said the Israeli military allowed 150 aid trucks loaded with tents to enter the enclave overnight Wednesday, and that it had promised to allow in mobile caravans for housing, too.",
      "Negotiations have begun for the second phase of the deal, which, if agreed, would see even more hostages released by Hamas and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Under the terms of the agreement, the current six-week first phase is to see 33 Israeli hostages released in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. So far, 21 hostages have been freed, including American-Israeli dual national Keith Siegel.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who was among those to condemn Mr. Trump's plan for Gaza, urged Hamas to resume hostage releases and \"avoid at all costs\" any resumption of fighting in the territory.",
      "Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday that if fighting did resume in Gaza, it would \"not end without Hamas' defeat and the release of all the hostages,\" adding that it would \"also enable the realization of US President Trump's vision for Gaza.\"",
      "In Hamas' terrorist attack on southern Israel in October 2023 some 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage. Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas has killed more than 48,000 people in Gaza, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists say the remnants of an ancient Roman basilica unearthed in the heart of London are \"one of the most significant discoveries\" in years.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of London's earliest-known ancient Roman basilica on the site of a planned 32-story skyscraper, right in the heart of what was once known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished to make way for the the new tower at 85 Gracechurch Street uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations over three feet wide, 13 feet deep and almost two millennia old.",
      "Sophie Jackson of the Museum of London Archaeology called it \"one of the most significant discoveries\" in years in British capital's oldest quarter, the City of London \u2014 the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and much earlier structures.",
      "The scientists say they have uncovered the foundations of a two-story building that was almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded the British isles and roughly 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement.",
      "The basilica was part of the forum, the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London, or Londinium, as it was called, where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city's governance.",
      "\"We're talking about the early stages of London here,\" said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. \"But it's a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy.\"",
      "Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center.",
      "Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the \"absolutely massive\" foundations discovered in several test pits dug by archaeologists suggests an \"extraordinary\" level of preservation of the building ruins.",
      "Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses \u2014 even ancient trash \u2014 could offer glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners.",
      "Property developers in Britain routinely have to bring in archaeologists as consultants as part of the construction planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Anglo-Saxon jewelry and remains and medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims.",
      "The latest discovery adds to the traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of the ancient wall that once surrounded Londinium, a portion of an amphitheater and a temple to the god Mithras that lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg.",
      "\"We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,\" Henderson-Schwartz said. \"But this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.\"",
      "Elsewhere in England, archaeologists have recently discovered a \"mysterious lump\" of a purple substance that in Roman times would have been worth more than gold, and a stash of coins worth over $125,000 dating back to the reign of Emperor Nero.",

      "In remarks similar to ones he made in the Oval Office Tuesday\u00a0with the president looking on, Musk said, \"We really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people \u2014 democracy,\" Musk said, wearing a black T-shirt that read: \"Tech Support.\" He also joked that he was the \"White House's tech support,\" borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Mr. Trump's blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That's included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role gave his comments more weight beyond being the world's wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\"A lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\" Musk said, referring to Mr. Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \"There's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I'm like, 'O.K. Well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?'\"",
      "He added that the U.S. under Mr. Trump is \"less interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\"",
      "There are \"times the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\" Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\" he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\"If hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there's too many men in power and execute them,\" Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \"kind of scary.\" He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\"",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \"Dubai Loop\" project in line with his work in the Boring Company - which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit. However, he and the Emirati government official speaking with him offered no immediate details of the plan.",
      "\"It's going to be like a wormhole,\" Musk promised. \"You just wormhole from one part of the city \u2014 boom \u2014 and you're out in another part of the city.\"",

At least 124 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide, and about two-thirds of them were Palestinians who were killed by Israel during its war against Hamas in Gaza, the CPJ said.",
      "The previous record was 113 journalists killed, in 2007, during the Iraq War.",
      "Other countries including Sudan, Pakistan, Mexico and Syria also had multiple cases of journalists killed last year, the report found.",
      "The CPJ considers a journalist or media worker someone who covered news or commented on public affairs, in any medium. To be included on its list, the person's death must have been work-related. The deaths can be deliberate or accidental, such as if a journalist is killed in a conflict zone. A journalist's death would not be included if there is evidence they were \"inciting violence with imminent effect or directly participating as\u00a0combatants\u00a0in armed conflict at the time of their deaths,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ says it only includes confirmed cases in its report, meaning it found evidence indicating the journalist was killed in connection with their work; it says it considers all war-zone cases as confirmed.",
      "Increased global conflict leads to record deaths",
      "Of the 124 journalists who were killed in 2024, the CPJ report said 82 were killed amid the war in Gaza\u00a0and three were\u00a0killed in Lebanon, where Israel was fighting Hezbollah. In at least 10 cases, CPJ says its investigation determined they were \"deliberately targeted.\" The group says it continues investigating whether at least 20 other cases may have been deliberate.",
      "Thirty-one of the journalists killed in Gaza were Palestinian freelancers who the CPJ said \"stepped in to fill the information void after many news outlets ceased to operate\" in the territory.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, the Israel Defense Forces said it \"takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists\" and that it \"has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists.\"",
      "The IDF sent a list of about half of a dozen \"so-called journalists named in CPJ's reports who've been found to have actively participated in and led terror efforts against Israel,\" including at least two whom it accused of directly participating \"in the October 7th massacre\" orchestrated by Hamas.",
      "Israel's military has frequently alleged that \"terror operatives\" in Gaza have doubled as journalists and could therefore be \"legitimate military targets,\" including some who've worked for Al Jazeera. The Qatari network has strongly denied this allegation.",
      "The uptick in journalist deaths comes amid a rising number of conflicts globally, the CPJ said. The other journalist killings in 2024 occurred in over a dozen countries, including Sudan, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "Sudan and Pakistan saw six journalist killings each, while Mexico had five. Four journalists were killed in Syria. Three died in Myanmar, where underground reporters are \"increasingly treated as enemy combatants,\" according to the CPJ. Another three journalist deaths were recorded in Iraq, marking the first journalist deaths there since 2020. Two journalists were killed in Haiti, where \"gangs now openly claim responsibility for journalist killings,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ said that it found countries where journalists are deliberately killed often try to \"bury evidence of killings, shift blame, and avoid accountability.\" Such actions put surviving journalists in even more danger, the group said, and remove \"the possibility of justice\" for those who have died.",
      "Around the world, journalists have also been intimidated, censored and arrested or assaulted. Such incidents were reported in Cameroon, Somalia and Afghanistan, even though there were no journalists killed in those countries. There were also no journalist deaths in the war between Ukraine and Russia, though several possibly targeted attacks left reporters injured, the CPJ said. A\u00a0Ukrainian journalist who was detained in August 2023 died in Russian custody last year.",
      "\"Conditions can grow more lethal for the press when those who kill journalists are not held to account. And fewer journalists means less information for citizens seeking the truth,\" the CPJ said.",

      "The call between Mr. Trump and Putin was the first known conversation between the two since the president returned to the White House for a second term. It came a day after Russia released\u00a0Pennsylvania schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence and was considered by the U.S. to be wrongfully detained.",
      "\"I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia,\" the president wrote on Truth Social\u00a0Wednesday morning. \"We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Putin talked about the \"great benefit that we will someday have in working together\" and agreed on the need to end Russia's war with Ukraine. In addition to the pledge to begin discussions on the war, the president and his Russian counterpart said they would visit \"each other's nation.\"",
      "The president said he has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to lead negotiations on the war.",
      "Speaking in the Oval Office later in the day, Mr. Trump said the phone call with Putin lasted roughly an hour, and said the two leaders would likely meet in Saudi Arabia for their first sitdown of his new term. He told reporters that Putin \"wants peace\" and \"wants to see it end.\" Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon after his call with the Russian leader. Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X that \"[n]o one wants peace more than Ukraine\" and that Ukraine is \"charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace.\" Mr. Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social that the conversation with Zelenskyy went \"very well\" and said it's \"time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's conversation with Putin came shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed to undercut\u00a0key Ukrainian positions in eventual peace talks, including by ruling out eventual membership in NATO. Speaking ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contract Group about more aid, Hegseth said peace in the country must include security guarantees that \"should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "The defense chief also said Ukraine's goal of returning to its borders before 2014, when Russia first invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula, was an \"unrealistic objective.\"",
      "The president, too, has addressed the prospect of Russia maintaining control of Ukrainian territory its forces have occupied, suggesting in an interview with Fox News that aired Monday that Ukraine \"may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday.\"",
      "In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump also said he is \"OK\" with taking the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO off the table. \"I don't think it's practical,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump frequently claims that Russia would not have launched its invasion of Ukraine three years ago if he were president and vowed on the campaign trail to quickly bring an end to the war. Vice President JD Vance is set to meet\u00a0with Ukraine's Zelenskyy at a security conference in Munich that begins Friday.",
      "The president has been a vehement critic of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, prompting concerns from Kyiv that assistance would stop flowing with him back in office. He told Fox News that aid could depend on Ukraine agreeing a trade deal that gives the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" he said. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",
      "The U.S. has provided more than $65 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, according to the State Department.",

      "\"Unprovoked shark bites plummeted in 2024,\" reads the headline of the report, which characterized the year as \"exceptionally calm\" for shark bites.",
      "Of 88 alleged shark-human interactions that researchers say they investigated last year, 71 bites were confirmed. The report segmented those incidents into unprovoked and provokes bites, of which there were 47 and 24, respectively. Seven of the attacks were fatal, including four unprovoked attacks, according to the research.",
      "Those figures did not account for instances where sharks attacked a boat or bit a human who was already dead. Several additional incidents where a person's injuries could not be indisputably attributed to a shark, over another predatory marine creature, were categorized as \"unconfirmed\" in the report.",
      "Confirmed attacks in 2024 dwarfed numbers reported in the previous year's International Shark Attack File, which recognized 91 global incidents, including 69 unprovoked bites and 22 provoked bites. Ten people died in shark attacks in 2023, with six killed in unprovoked attacks, researchers said at the time.",
      "The number of attacks last year was \"well below\" the 10-year average, of about 70 unprovoked shark bites recorded annually, the new report notes. It also calls the four unprovoked attacks a \"significant reduction\" compared with previous years.",

      "Divers suffering bites after trying to touch or otherwise harass sharks, attacks on spearfishermen, bites on people who attempted to feed sharks, and bites that happen while a shark is being unhooked or removed from a fishing net, are some examples of scenarios that would meet criteria for a \"provoked\" attack.",
      "Unprovoked bites are of particular interest to the researchers studying shark attack patterns.",
      "\"We're interested in the natural patterns of shark behavior so that we can understand why people occasionally get bitten by these animals,\" said Gavin Naylor, the director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, in a statement. \"Any cue or attribute that modifies an animal's natural behavior is something that, we as scientists, want to exclude.\"",
      "Places with the most unprovoked shark attacks",
      "Most of 2024's unprovoked shark attacks happened in the United States, which follows a longstanding pattern, the new report notes. Last year, there were 28 confirmed shark bites in U.S. waters, accounting for 60% of the worldwide total despite being lower than the 36 unprovoked incidents confirmed in 2023.",
      "Half of U.S. attacks took place in Florida in 2024, which is also common for the state often known to experience the highest concentrations of shark bites of anywhere in the world. Like the national total, unprovoked shark bites were down in Florida, where the five-year average is 19 unprovoked attacks.",
      "Australia trailed the U.S. total with nine unprovoked bites, a sizable decrease from the country's five-year average of 15. Egypt, the Maldives, Western Sahara, the Turks and Caicos Islands, French Polynesia, Mozambique, India, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, and Belize each reported one unprovoked shark attack.",
      "The fatal attacks occurred in the U.S., Egypt, the Maldives and Western Sahara, with one death confirmed in each place, according to the Shark Attack File. Despite Florida's tally of unprovoked bites, the only U.S. death in a shark attack last year happened in Hawaii when surfer Tamayo Perry was killed off the island of Oahu. The species of shark involved in that attack is unknown, researchers said.",

    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

    "summary": "Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns in West Africa, which supplies around 70% of the world's cacao, are disrupting the crop, affecting both the quantity and quality of beans \u2014 and driving up prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "As Valentine's Day approaches, the craving for chocolate intensifies. But chocolate continues to face a significant challenge: Climate change is threatening cacao production, particularly in West Africa, which produces around 70% of the world's supply. Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns are disrupting cacao crops, affecting both the quantity and quality of beans \u2014 and driving up prices for consumers.",
      "Cocoa prices surged 136% between July 2022 and February 2024, according to UNCTAD commodities price monitoring. For the first time, the price per metric ton on the futures market crossed $10,000 last March, according to the United Nations trade agency, which attributed the increases in part to climate change.",
      "A new analysis by scientists at research nonprofit Climate Central highlights how climate change has pushed temperatures above the optimal range for cacao trees in Western Africa. This analysis is \"the first that we know of that really tries to put a number on how much humans and climate change are influencing cocoa trees and cocoa production from West Africa,\" said Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at Climate Central.",
      "West African countries have long been the heart of cocoa production, producing around 3.48 million metric tons of cocoa beans in the 2022-2023 season. This massive output is vital to the global chocolate industry, where it takes about 400 cocoa beans to make just one pound of chocolate. Millions of farmers depend on the crop for their livelihoods. In Ghana, cocoa production provides employment for 3.2 million farmers and workers, more than 10% of its total population. \"Climate change is threatening the existence of cocoa farmers and their sources of livelihoods,\" says cocoa farmer Emmanuel Essah-Mensah from Ghana, who advises several hundred cocoa farms.",
      "Cacao trees are grown in regions within 10 degrees north and south of the equator where the climate is ideal for its cultivation. The crop \u2014 the raw, unprocessed form of cocoa beans \u2014 has two primary harvest periods in Western Africa: the main crop harvest from September to March and the mid-crop from May to August. After flowering, it takes about five to six months for the pods to mature. Once ripe, the pods are harvested by hand and then split open to extract the seeds, which undergo fermentation and drying processes to develop the flavors essential for chocolate production.",
      "The ideal temperature range for cacao growth is up to 32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 Fahrenheit, but recent trends indicate that climate change is increasing the number of days above this range. Climate Central examined temperature data from 44 cacao-producing districts, regions, or states in West Africa, including Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria. Over the past decade, approximately two-thirds of the cacao-growing region faced an increase of at least an additional six weeks' worth of days each year hotter than is ideal for the trees due to climate change, while one-third experienced at least eight additional weeks of excessive heat.",
      "Excessive heat severely impacts cacao production. Cacao plants rely on stable temperatures for proper photosynthesis, and too many hot days can affect photosynthesis, leading to shriveled flowers and smaller, rotting cacao pods.",
      "The impact of climate change extends beyond heat stress. Cacao trees are also sensitive to rainfall patterns. Cacao thrives when rainfall totals between 1,500 and 2,000 millimeters, or about 59 to 79 inches annually, with no dry spells longer than three months, according to the International Cocoa Organization . In July 2024, parts of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire saw 40% more rainfall than usual, flooding fields and damaging crops, while December brought little rain to the region, which slows photosynthesis, leading to fewer flowers and more underdeveloped beans. Erratic rainfall patterns are leaving farmers with unpredictable growing conditions, contributing to lower harvests and higher prices.",
      "To adapt, some farmers are turning to diverse, nature-friendly agricultural practices, such as planting taller trees between cacao plants, creating healthy fertile soils that hold onto moisture and providing protective shade for cacao plants. However, such strategies are not foolproof and can take time to implement. The future of cacao farming in a warming world remains uncertain, and ongoing challenges threaten to continue driving up the price of chocolate, making your favorite sweet treat pricier to enjoy."

      "\"Ordinarily, if somebody makes a false statement against somebody, it's defamation, and you can get sued,\" Melcher said. \"But if the statement is made in a lawsuit or in contemplation of an immediate suit being filed, it is protected under the litigation privilege \u2013 that's Civil Code, Section 47.",
      "\"So, California Civil Code, Section 47 says statements made by a party in the course of a lawsuit are not defamatory, they're not actionable. You can't sue for defamation. And that's been interpreted to mean, 'OK, well, literally, if you're filing tomorrow, and you're maybe given a press release or demand letter, you can be covered under that umbrella that has to be immediately contemplated.'",
      "\"So, this \u2018never intended\u2019 is the code word for him saying that the leaks to the press are not covered by this litigation privilege because they were not made in the context of a lawsuit, and so that's what gives him the right to sue. Otherwise, he would be blocked.\"",

    "story": [
      "Harvard medical student and researcher Nick Norwitz recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet.",
      "Meat enthusiasts have long endorsed the \"carnivore diet,\" a meal plan that includes consuming only animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs \u2014 but the program is frowned upon by some who embrace plant-based foods like vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (See the video at the top of this article, and more videos at https://www.youtube.com/@nicknorwitzPhD.)",
      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\" (Nick Norwitz)",
      "Instead, Norwitz said it should be considered an \"adaptive eating pattern.\"",
      "\"Not eating normally is not an eating disorder \u2014 in fact, I'd say standard American diet eating patterns could themselves reflect a form of eating disorder,\" he said.",
      "Myth No. 7: A meat-heavy diet is bad for the brain",
      "Following recent research that suggests red meat intake is linked to dementia, Norwitz said this data is \"misleading.\"",
      "The study in question lumped together different types of food, he noted, adding that there was \"tremendous healthy user bias.\"",
      "\"I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated.\"",
      "\"Participants who consumed more red meat had a higher prevalence of current smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes, and lower levels of dietary quality education, socioeconomic status and physical activity,\" Norwitz says in the video.",
      "Actually, he adds, \"unprocessed red meat intake was not linked to dementia or cognitive decline \u2014 just processed red meat intake, but this was somewhat overlooked in the study itself.\"",
      "Myth No. 8: The carnivore diet is for everyone",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\"",
      "The diet warrants \"further scientific exploration,\" Norwitz said.",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, although he noted the carnivore diet is \"misunderstood\" and \"unfairly scapegoated.\" (iStock)",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, adding that \"context and nuance are essential.\"",
      "\"However, I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated and thrown under the \u2018big food bus.\u2019\"",
      "Doctors give insight into the carnivore diet",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, shared thoughts on the carnivore diet with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The advantage is that meat is a high-packed source of calories from fat and a lot of protein, so it can help you lose weight,\" he said. \"But I think it is unhealthy. Too many saturated animal fats are bad for the heart and the diet is high in cholesterol.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Siegel instead recommends opting for the Mediterranean diet, which is heavy in vegetables, nuts and olive oil. \"With its unsaturated fats and antioxidants, it is much healthier,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, said she has found carnivore diets to be \"indispensable tools\" in her clinical practice.",
      "The diet could potentially help identify food sensitivities, resolve chronic constipation and IBS symptoms, quiet food addiction and binge-eating, and break weight loss plateaus, according to Ede.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat,\" one doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "\"The hypothesis that meat is dangerous to human health has driven a long and passionate hunt for evidence against meat that has thus far come up empty-handed,\" the doctor, who is also the author of \"Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",
      "\"In my research, I have yet to find a credible, plausible health argument against including meat of any kind, red or otherwise, in the human diet,\" she went on.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern \u2026 is ideal for everyone.\"",
      "Ede added, \"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us.\"",

      "The doctor did acknowledge that adhering to carnivore diets poses potential challenges.",
      "\"These include the potential for boredom that can come from the relative lack of variety, the social challenges of eating in a way that may make others feel uncomfortable, and the logistical challenges of finding meat, seafood, poultry, and/or egg dishes prepared simply enough to be suitable for the diet, especially when traveling or eating at others\u2019 homes,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

      "SpaceX's Starship exploded during an unmanned test flight. Debris from the explosion streaked through the sky, leaving people on the ground amazed and confused. (Greg Munch /TMX)",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) said Monday that its Euclid space telescope has detected a rare bright halo of light around a nearby galaxy.",
      "Known as an Einstein ring, the halo was captured in photos encircling a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away, which is considered close by cosmic standards. A single light-year is measured at 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",
      "Euclid blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on July 1, 2023, to begin a six-year mission to explore the dark universe.",
      "GIANT STELLAR NURSERY REVEALED IN NEW IMAGES FROM ESA'S SPACE TELESCOPE",
      "A sea of colorful stars and galaxies appear to swim in the vast blackness of space around a hazy halo at center stage. In the middle of the image, the fuzzy-looking bulb of light in a warm shade of yellow extends around a small bright spot, nestled within a thin light circle that appears to be drawn closely around it. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",
      "For most of the population out there, an Einstein Ring is an \"extremely rare phenomenon,\" the ESA said.",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE SPIES SPECTACULAR STAR BIRTH CLUSTER BEYOND THE MILKY WAY",
      "A thin ring of a perfect circular shape and a piercingly bright white disc in its middle are the protagonists of this image. They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",
      "The galaxy, called NGC 6506, is about 590 million light-years away, and this is the first time the ring of light around its center has ever been detected.",
      "\"All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically,\" Conor O\u2019Riordan of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said. \"This one is particularly special, because it\u2019s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.\"",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE CAPTURES PHOTOS OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUPERNOVA EVER SEEN",
      "The text paragraph explains the principle behind the Einstein rings. (ESA)",
      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",
      "Over the course of the mission, scientists expect Euclid will reveal more about the role of gravity in the Universe, as well as the nature of dark energy and dark matter.",

      "Euclid will map over a third of the sky and observe billions of galaxies as far as 10 billion light-years away, ESA said. In doing so, scientists expect Euclid to find around 100,000 more strong lenses, though finding one so cosmically close to home and so spectacular, ESA added, \"is astonishing.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says scammers exploit fears, falsely claim computer issues to access your personal data.",
      "If there is one corporation that is targeted by scammers more than anyone else, it is Microsoft. From customer support scams to impersonation and phishing attacks, the company\u2019s services are constantly under threat. Recently, even Russia-sponsored hackers managed to breach Microsoft and steal sensitive information.",
      "While Microsoft services as a whole are prime targets, one that stands out is Teams. The collaboration tool is used by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it a goldmine for attackers. Hackers are using it to spread\u00a0phishing,\u00a0vishing and\u00a0quishing campaigns, relying on social engineering tactics to trick victims into sharing private and sensitive data.",

      "The rising attacks on Microsoft Teams users",
      "Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting Microsoft Teams users with\u00a0sophisticated attack methods. One such technique involves malicious GIF images that exploit worm-like vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to take over accounts and infiltrate chat sessions when the image is opened.",
      "Hackers also insert malware-laden files into chat threads, tricking users into downloading DLL files that enable system takeover. Phishing campaigns leverage compromised accounts or domains to send deceptive invitations, luring victims into downloading harmful files.",
      "Some attackers use email bombing and vishing, posing as tech support to overwhelm users with spam emails before tricking them into granting remote access. Compromised email addresses and stolen Microsoft 365 credentials provide another entry point for unauthorized access.",
      "Plus, external access settings in Microsoft Teams, which often allow outside users to initiate chats or meetings, can be exploited if not properly restricted. Another common tactic is sending phishing links through Teams chats, often disguised as invoices or payment notifications, leading to ransomware infections.",

      "Scammers have been running fake job schemes for a while, but their tactics keep evolving. Lately, I reported how\u00a0fake job emails are being used to install crypto mining software that slows down computers. Now, they are using Microsoft Teams chat to trick people.",
      "It usually starts with an email about a job followed by a suggestion to do the interview over Teams. The first red flag is that the entire interview happens over chat with no video and no call. After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number. Some victims are even asked to buy equipment for the job, pay a hiring fee or purchase gift cards, which are classic signs that the whole thing is a scam.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Microsoft Teams",
      "1) Avoid opening suspicious links and attachments: Be cautious of unsolicited links or attachments, especially in chat messages or emails. Cybercriminals often use these to deliver malware or phishing links. Never click on links that seem unusual or come from unknown sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",
      "ENERGY-SAVING SCAM USES ELON MUSK\u2019S NAME \u2013 HERE\u2019S THE TRUTH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers and hackers are not slowing down, so staying sharp is the only way to stay ahead. If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The best way to reduce companies from collecting your data is to remove invasive apps from your phone. Many apps request unnecessary permissions that can track your activity, so deleting them limits exposure. Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

      "The healthcare industry has recently been a major target for hackers. You might remember the 2024 Ascension attack, which led to significant disruptions.",
      "The Change Healthcare breach was also on a massive scale. UnitedHealth initially\u00a0claimed that 100 million Americans were affected, but later\u00a0raised that number to 190 million.",
      "There have been countless other incidents, and now you can add another to the list. Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC), a Connecticut-based federally qualified health center, has disclosed a data breach following a criminal cyberattack on its systems.",

      "What You Need to Know",
      "Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC)\u00a0detected a data breach on Jan. 2 after identifying unusual activity within its computer systems. An investigation confirmed that a skilled hacker had accessed and extracted data but did not delete or lock any information. If CHC's claims are accurate, this is a positive outcome, as hackers often deploy ransomware, a type of attack in which they lock systems and demand payment before restoring access.",
      "In a\u00a0regulatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office, CHC said that 1,060,936 people were affected by the data breach. The type of information compromised varies depending on an individual\u2019s relationship with CHC. Patient data that may have been accessed includes names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, test results, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For individuals who are not regular CHC patients but received COVID-19 services at a CHC clinic, the breached data may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, gender, race, ethnicity and insurance details if provided. Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",
      "The organization did not disclose how the hackers gained access to the data or whether proper cybersecurity measures were in place at the time of the breach. While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",

The organization said there is no evidence at this time that the compromised data has been misused.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach",
      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

      "A group led by the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute (RRPFI) has issued a series of takeaways following its recent visit to Taiwan. The takeaways can be seen as a roadmap of ideas for the Trump administration.",
      "The eight-member delegation consisting of U.S. national security and business leaders concluded their strategic visit to Taiwan last month amid the presidential transition in Washington, D.C., a new administration in Taipei and ongoing Chinese coercion and aggression in East Asia.",
      "The series of meetings was designed to strengthen ties between the United States and Taiwan across Taiwan\u2019s political leaders and business elite. Members of the RRPFI delegation identified several key takeaways from the trip that could compliment the Trump administration's policies toward strengthening the U.S.-Taiwan partnership.",

      "The delegation said that while a number of President Donald Trump's selections for top administration roles have expressed previously held views about policy involving Taiwan, there is a general mix of optimism and uncertainty over the direction the administration will take on security and economic matters relating to Taiwan.",

      "Increasing defense spending, particularly with NATO allies, was a centerpiece of Trump's first term. The delegation stressed national unity on defense and said elected officials from all parties need to live up to the intent to increase defense spending.\u00a0The delegation emphasized to Taiwanese partners that the American public expects U.S. allies and partners to shoulder the primary burden of their own defense, a notion that will certainly appeal to the Trump administration.",
      "The delegation asserted that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and how the West handled it since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion are on the minds of Taiwanese leaders. The Biden administration used the Presidential Drawdown Authority on at least 55 occasions since August 2021 to provide Ukraine with military assistance from Department of Defense stockpiles, according to the State Department. The RRPFI delegation argue that the Presidential Drawdown Authority along with Foreign Military Sales are valuable tools for enhancing Taiwan\u2019s capabilities and ensuring peace and stability in the region.",

      "Taiwan currently spends 2.45% of its GDP on defense, and Taiwanese leaders have expressed their intention to continue to increase their defense budget. Defense spending has increased by 80% since 2016, and their defense budget accounted for 15% of its total budget in 2024, according to Taiwan\u2019s government.",

      "Among the top 20 states that take more money from the federal government than they sent in tax payments, 13 are solidly red states that voted for Trump in the last three elections, according to an analysis by the Rockefeller Institute of Government of the fiscal 2024 budget. Meanwhile, the top five states (and nine of the top 10) that send more money to the Treasury Department than they receive voted for Democrats in the last three presidential elections.",
      "Another imperative for Republicans in rural areas is to protect farmers, who rely on the federal government as a major customer. The U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk have targeted for dismantling,  administers the Food for Peace program, under which the government buys and distributes American crops to help fight hunger around the world.",
      "A coalition of Republicans in rural states and districts, including House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson, of Pennsylvania, introduced legislation this week to save the Food for Peace program by transferring it to the Department of Agriculture.",

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa \u2014 the Senate president pro tempore and chair of the Judiciary Committee \u2014 who protested when Trump threatened to levy tariffs on imports from Canada.",

During the last Trump administration, retaliatory tariffs from trade partners set off a broader trade war that hit wide swaths of American industry, from agriculture to manufacturing to aerospace and motor vehicles to distilled spirits. Already, Canada announced retaliatory measures that take direct aim at Kentucky production, targeting products like peanut butter and whiskey.\u201d",
      "Paul, who often disagrees with McConnell, found common ground with him on that issue.",

    "story": [
      "Danielle R. Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who was ordered to drop the corruption charges against New York City mayor Eric Adams, has resigned, a senior official said Thursday.",
      "The move appears to be a rebuke to the Justice Department. It comes three days after Emil Bove, the acting U.S. deputy attorney general, issued a memo ordering federal prosecutors in New York to drop the case against Adams in part because it hampered his ability to tackle \u201cillegal immigration and violent crime.\u201d",
      "Sassoon announced her resignation in a brief statement to colleagues that does not refer to the directive from the Justice Department, the senior official said.",
      "Sassoon, who took over the office last month, was a well-respected prosecutor with unimpeachable conservative credentials. Best known for successfully prosecuting crypto whiz kid-turned-fraudster Sam Bankman Fried, she was a member of the Federalist Society and had clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who was long the Supreme Court\u2019s most influential conservative.",
      "It was not immediately clear who would take over the office, which is sometimes referred to as the \u201cSovereign District of New York\u201d for its independent streak.",
      "Adams, a former New York police captain elected mayor in 2021, was charged in an indictment unsealed in September with one count of conspiracy to receive campaign contributions from foreign nationals and commit wire fraud and bribery, two counts of soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals and one count of soliciting and accepting a bribe.",
      "The indictment accused him of taking $100,000 worth of free plane tickets and luxury hotel stays from wealthy Turkish nationals and at least one government official in a nearly decadelong corruption scheme.",
      "Adams has pleaded not guilty. He has insisted that he is innocent and argued that the charges are politically motivated.",
      "In his memo, Bove suggested that the case against Adams was political.\u00a0It \u201ccannot be ignored that Mayor Adams criticized the prior Administration\u2019s immigration policies before the charges were filed,\u201d Bove wrote.",
      "There is no evidence to suggest that the charges were pursued for that reason.",
      "When the indictment against Adams was unsealed, James Dennehy, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s New York field office, called the charges \u201ca stinging reminder that no one is above the law or beyond reproach\u201c and \u201ca sobering moment for all of us who place our trust in elected officials.\u201d"

      "McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, said Kennedy had a \"record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions.\"",
      "\"Mr. Kennedy failed to prove he is the best possible person to lead America\u2019s largest health agency,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"As he takes office, I sincerely hope Mr. Kennedy will choose not to sow further doubt and division but to restore trust in our public health institutions.\u201d",

      "The Republican senator who most vocally questioned Kennedy\u2019s qualifications, Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, ultimately voted to confirm him. Cassidy, a longtime physician who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, had said he was \u201cstruggling\u201d with his decision after he quizzed Kennedy\u00a0at two confirmation hearings.",
      "But Cassidy, who is already politically vulnerable should he run for re-election, said in a floor speech last week that Kennedy gave him a series of reassurances that he would maintain the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s advisory committee on immunization practices and that he would not remove statements on the CDC\u2019s website noting that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "Kennedy also secured the backing of two other key Republicans, Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, and Susan Collins, of Maine, before the vote.",
      "Murkowski\u00a0announced her support after, she said, Kennedy reassured her about his stance on vaccines.",
      "\"He has made numerous commitments to me and my colleagues, promising to work with Congress to ensure public access to information and to base vaccine recommendations on data-driven, evidence-based, and medically sound research,\" Murkowski wrote on X on Wednesday. \"These commitments are important to me and, on balance, provide assurance for my vote.\"",
      "Collins offered a similar statement this week, saying Kennedy had allayed her concerns about his stances on vaccines.",
      "In addition to the CDC, the HHS secretary oversees the heads of the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Kennedy initially ran for president last year as a Democrat before he launched an independent campaign. He eventually dropped his bid and endorsed Trump, taking his \"Make America Healthy Again\" message onto the campaign trail.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s call to more closely examine chemicals in the nation\u2019s food brought support from both parties. But his past activism against vaccines and his advancement of false theories that they are linked to autism prevented him from winning any Democratic support.",
      "\u201cWhen you continue to sow doubt about settled science, it makes it impossible for us to move forward,\u201d Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., told Kennedy in an emotional statement at a committee hearing last month. \u201cSo that\u2019s what the problem is here, is the relitigating and the rehashing and the continuing to sow doubt so we can\u2019t move forward. And it freezes us in place.\u201d"

      "McMahon said she would present a plan that senators could get on board with.

Several of the early appointees at the Education Department came from the think tank.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether McMahon supports eliminating the department, a longtime goal of some Republicans.

    "summary": "The White House terminated multiple U.S. attorneys on Wednesday amid a period of upheaval at the Justice Department initiated by President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House terminated multiple U.S. attorneys on Wednesday evening amid a period of upheaval at the Justice Department initiated by President Donald Trump, who was himself a criminal defendant in two separate federal cases until they were dropped after his election in November.",
      "The full extent of the terminations was not clear as of Thursday morning. The White House did not respond to a request for comment, and a Justice Department spokesman could not immediately provide a figure for how many of the nation's 93 U.S. attorneys in federal court districts across the country were impacted.",
      "The departure of the remaining U.S. attorneys who were nominated by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate was expected at some point, but their immediate terminations by the White House were a departure from history. In the past, politically appointed U.S. attorneys had been asked to resign by the Justice Department.",
      "The terminations impacted at least two court-appointed U.S. attorneys, including one career federal prosecutor who had previously worked Jan. 6 cases. A spokesperson for that court-appointed U.S. attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California Tara McGrath was \u201cinformed of her termination in a communication from the White House, at the direction of the President of the United States,\" according to a press release from McGrath\u2019s office.",
      "The U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, Ismail Ramsey, also received a termination letter from the White House, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "U.S. Attorney for Maryland Erek L. Barron and U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina Dena J. King both announced their departures Wednesday but did not provide reasons. McGrath, Ramsey, Barron and King were Biden nominees confirmed by the Senate.",
      "U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington Tessa Gorman, who was a court-appointed top federal prosecutor, \u201cwas removed from her post,\u201d a spokesperson said. Gorman first took on the role in an acting capacity before she was named to the role by former Attorney General Merrick Garland. The judges of the Western District of Washington named her to the position in May 2024.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told NBC News that one of the fired U.S. attorneys received a letter from Trent Morse, the deputy director of the Office of Presidential Personnel, that read: \u201cAt the direction of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as U.S. Attorney is terminated, effective immediately.\u201d",
      "The White House\u2019s direct involvement in the firings is unusual, as such decisions typically come from the Justice Department. During Trump\u2019s first term, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked U.S. Attorneys to resign, and only one U.S. attorney was terminated after they refused to resign.",
      "During Biden\u2019s term, Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys were asked to resign, and were given three weeks to depart at a set date, while a number of interim U.S. attorneys who were not Senate-confirmed (including those appointed by courts) remained. That action also originated from the Justice Department.",
      "Since Trump took office 24 days ago, the Justice Department has been through a tremendous period of unrest. It started on the day of Trump's inauguration, when he issued a mass pardon for Jan. 6 rioters convicted in the biggest federal investigation in American history and then named an advocate for Capitol rioters the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.",
      "Since then, Trump's acting deputy attorney general \u2014 who himself worked Jan. 6 cases \u2014 fired federal prosecutors who had originally been hired to work Capitol cases and demanded a list of FBI employees who investigated the Capitol siege. The Trump administration also demanded a list of probationary FBI employees, raising fears of mass firings that would impact the bureau for years to come."

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put on a brave face in his response \u2014 as many observers say he has little choice but to do when it comes to Washington, Ukraine\u2019s biggest benefactor \u2014 saying that while Trump's phone call with Putin on Wednesday was \"not pleasant,\" he still trusted Trump's assertion that Moscow was not being given priority.",
      "But make no mistake, Trump\u2019s comments will be very badly received in Kyiv, according to Orysia Lutsevych, a director at Chatham House, a London think tank.",
      "The remarks \"show the U.S.\u2019 weakness, as it caters to Putin\u2019s wishes without Russia having to compromise or concede anything,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cPutin\u2019s bluff that he is \u2018winning\u2019 seems to be working with Trump.\u201d",
      "While Russia has made slow gains on the battlefield in the last year, it still commands roughly the same 20% of Ukrainian land that it did 12 months ago. In addition, Ukrainian forces still hold a sliver of Russian territory.",
      "European powers are also typically measured in their statements to the White House. But they expressed clear anxiety that Trump might be negotiating with Putin while leaving both them and Zelenskyy out of the conversation.",
      "\u201cUkraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations,\u201d France, Germany, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement. It did not mention Trump by name, but its meaning was unambiguous. \u201cWe are looking forward to discussing the way ahead together with our American allies.\u201d",
      "Asked about the criticisms of Trump's Ukraine strategy, Brian Hughes, a National Security Council spokesman, said in an emailed statement that Trump \"inherited a world on fire thanks to a generation of so-called experts from the foreign policy establishment.\"",
      "The president was \"quickly reversing their terrible mistakes, and America is once again the dominant force for peace and stability,\u201d he said.\u00a0He wrote that Trump's \"America First diplomacy is paying real dividends for Americans and for peace-loving people across the globe.\"",
      "Though American allies knew a stark new era was coming under Trump, the speed and frankness of his words and actions this week have stunned even seasoned observers of the conflict.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump had a call with Putin \u2014 before making a call to Zelenskyy \u2014 in which he appeared to offer up many of the Kremlin\u2019s demands with little in return.",
      "\u201cWe had a great call,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office. He said he was \u201cOK\u201d with Ukraine not getting NATO membership and that it was \u201cunlikely\u201d it would get back territory invaded by Russia.",
      "\"I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelenskyy wants peace, and I want peace,\" he said. \"I just want to see people stop getting killed.\"",
      "Trump also said he and Putin may meet in Saudi Arabia on an unspecified date.",
      "Nevertheless, Andrii Kovalenko, head of Ukraine\u2019s counter-disinformation center, was adamant that his country \u201cwill not be left out of the negotiations under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News that \u201cUkraine and the United States have a substantive dialogue\u201d and that it was \u201cimportant not to let Putin manipulate\u201d the process.",
      "On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that American troops would not be part of any peacekeeping mission sent to Ukraine, telling Europe that it would be expected to front up resources.",
      "Biden and other presidents had fudged the issue of Ukraine's NATO membership, knowing that would inflame the already hostile relations with Moscow. But Trump took it off the table outright.",
      "\u201cMaybe Ukraine will have to give up territory. Maybe Ukraine will not join NATO now. Maybe U.S. soldiers will not be part of a peacekeeping mission,\u201d McFaul wrote. \u201cBut all of these concessions to Putin should be negotiated in return for Russian concessions that advance Ukraine and America.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The fossil of a Jurassic bird unearthed in southeastern China has major implications for the history of avian evolution, researchers say.",
      "The newly discovered Baminornis zhenghensis, a quail-sized bird, roamed the skies some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, meaning it is among the oldest birds known to mankind, along with the iconic Archaeopteryx that was discovered in Germany in 1862 and is of similar age.",
      "\u201cFor more than 150 years now, Archaeopteryx has stood alone,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a University of Edinburgh paleontologist who wrote a commentary accompanying the study.",
      "\u201cDuring all of that time, it has remained as the only unquestionable bird fossil from the Jurassic Period,\u201d he told NBC News in an email.",
      "While there have been other birdlike Jurassic fossils found here and there, Brusatte said, there was a \u201chuge mystery and a frustrating gap\u201d in the fossil record: If Archaeopteryx was flying by then, other birds must have been too. So where were their fossils?",
      "The 2023 discovery of Baminornis in Zhenghe county in China\u2019s Fujian province, now among the most important discoveries since Archaeopteryx, helps fill that gap, he said, making it the \u201csecond unquestioned bird from the Jurassic Period.\u201d",
      "Unlike the half-bird, half-reptile Archaeopteryx, which had a long and skinny tail similar to that of a velociraptor, Baminornis had a short tail with some of its vertebrae fused into a short, stubby nubbin called a\u00a0pygostyle \u2014 a crucial aerodynamic feature that pushes the body\u2019s center of mass toward the wings, similar to those in modern-day birds that help them fly better.",
      "Until the discovery of Baminornis, short tails had been found only in birds known to have lived around 20 million years later,\u00a0such as Eoconfuciusornis and Protopteryx.",
      "\u201cWhat excites me most is that it is a more advanced bird than Archaeopteryx, and it could fly much better,\u201d Brusatte said.",
      "Baminornis was much more anatomically complex than Archaeopteryx, which Brusatte said was a \u201cprimitive\u201d bird with claws and sharp teeth like its dinosaur ancestors.",
      "Archaeopteryx, which played a crucial role in determining that today\u2019s birds evolved from dinosaurs, was a \u201ctextbook example of a creature caught in the act of evolution like a freeze frame,\u201d he added.",
      "The vast difference between the two similarly aged birds, discovered about 5,500 miles apart, has led the team behind the Nature study to believe that avian evolution occurred millions of years earlier than previously thought, with the estimate now at about 164 to 172 million years ago.",
      "In addition to dozens of fossils of aquatic or semiaquatic animals, the Zhenghe Fauna collection, as it\u2019s referred to, includes at least three fossils so far that belong to the group including birds and their closest relatives. The researchers said this suggests the collection holds great potential to \u201cenrich our understanding of early bird diversification\u201d and \u201cfill a critical gap in the evolutionary history of terrestrial ecosystem\u201d toward the end of the Jurassic period.",
      "Though the Baminornis fossil preserved much of the skeleton, the feathers were not preserved, leaving unanswered questions about the size and structure of its wings. It was also missing the skull, limiting clues about the bird\u2019s diet.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cBaminornis tells us that a variety of birds lived during the Jurassic, and they flew in different ways,\u201d Brusatte said."

    "summary": "Money can\u2019t buy you love \u2014 or as much cocoa as it used to, with adverse weather denting West African crops and chocolatiers adding more fillers like nuts.",
    "story": [
      "If you\u2019re not a fan of nuts in your sweets, Valentine\u2019s Day could cost you more this year. The chocolates inside many of this holiday\u2019s heart-shaped boxes will likely contain more filler ingredients like nuts and fruits to offset the cost of pure chocolate.",
      "\u201cWe used to look at hazelnuts and pistachio as an expensive inclusion,\u201d said Jacques Torres, a chocolatier with high-end shops in New York City. \u201cToday, those nuts allow us to lower the cost of our chocolate bar.\u201d",
      "The price of raw cocoa, chocolate\u2019s key ingredient, has surged by 200% over the past year, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks online retail prices. On global commodities markets, cocoa futures are down slightly in recent weeks after peaking above $12,000 per ton \u2014 a record \u2014 just before Christmas. Two years ago, they were less than $2,500.",
      "We used to look at hazelnuts and pistachio as an expensive inclusion. Today, those nuts allow us to lower the cost of a chocolate bar.",
      "Chocolatier Jacques Torres",
      "Torres said he had to raise prices by 20% last month to offset the higher costs, and he anticipates another hike before the end of the year.",
      "The historic price run-up just ahead of the chocolate industry\u2019s biggest day of the year has been months in the making. Disruptive weather patterns fueled by climate change have hammered West Africa, where most of the world\u2019s cacao, the raw form of the bean that gets processed into cocoa, is grown. Similar challenges have been mounting for coffee farmers, too, fueling a sharp price spike on global markets that consumers are increasingly expected to feel this year.",
      "The cacao bean grows best in temperatures up to 89 degrees Fahrenheit and with annual rainfall less than 2,000 millimeters. In 2024, 71% of cacao-producing areas in West Africa experienced an average of 42 days with temperatures above that heat threshold, with some areas receiving 40% more rainfall than expected during the peak of the rainy season, according to a report released this week by Climate Central, a climate research institute.",
      "The increased temperatures and precipitation contribute to fungal diseases in cacao beans, the researchers said. Warm, humid conditions also breed mealybugs, which can spread an infection that spoils cacao crops. The combined impact of excessive heat and rainfall severely affected yield for cacao farmers. In the 2023-2024 harvest season, production was down 13.1% from the previous season, the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute told NBC News.",
      "Intensifying and more frequent extreme heat events and excessive precipitation are directly linked to global warming, as rising temperatures trap more moisture in the atmosphere. Climate scientists project excessive rainfall patterns to persist in West Africa through the rest of the century, while the entire continent warms 0.3 degrees Celsius faster per decade than the worldwide average.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of the new norm,\u201d said Jason Clay, the executive director of the Markets Institute for the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cWith climate change, we\u2019re seeing that there are more bad years than there are good years in some crops, in some locations.\u201d",
      "The Wells Fargo researchers estimate the cocoa supply deficit is now the worst it\u2019s been in 60 years, standing at negative 478,000 metric tons. The crunch is triggering doubts about festivities beyond Valentine\u2019s Day.",
      "\u201cNow the big question is about Easter,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThe bigger question is next Christmas \u2014 that\u2019s where things are going to be a little bit more sticky.\u201d",
      "Even Hershey is responding to the market squeeze. The chocolate giant requested permission from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to buy over 90,000 metric tons of cocoa, more than nine times the amount allowed by the exchange, Bloomberg reported last month. Regulators denied the request, saying a sale that large would\u2019ve monopolized the global supply.",
      "A Hershey spokesperson didn\u2019t comment on the CFTC decision but dismissed worries of a shortage, saying the company \u201chas a rigorous commodity procurement process, and we are well-covered in our cocoa needs for 2025.\u201d",
      "David Branch, sector manager of Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute, predicts chocolate products could become the next victim of shrinkflation \u2014 when brands reduce the size of their products without adjusting prices proportionately, a practice that has drawn scrutiny among Democratic lawmakers as contributing to inflation.",
      "With climate change, we\u2019re seeing that there are more bad years than there are good years in some crops.",
      "Jason Clay, World Wildlife Fund",
      "\u201cThe 30-piece bags of the mini candy bars, I think we\u2019re going to see that shrink a little bit,\u201d Branch said. \u201cIt may be 20 pieces in a bag instead of 30, and the price point kind of stays the same.\u201d",
      "Chocolate sales topped $21 billion in the 12 months ending in mid-August last year, up 1.5% from the prior 12-month period, according to the National Confectioners Association, even as units sold fell nearly 5% \u2014 indicating consumers spent more for less chocolate.",
      "Keeping chocolate affordable will require stepped-up environmental protections in cocoa-producing areas, advocates warn.",
      "\u201cClimate change has barely started to affect food production. It\u2019s going to get much worse,\u201d Clay said. \u201cThe good news is that if you get trees planted for shade, you can actually reduce temperatures from getting as hot as they do in these deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Clay said chocolate producers need to work together, rather than in competition, to invest in protective measures. That includes planting more trees, ensuring sustainable pay for cacao farmers and genetically modifying crops to become more disease-resistant.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t mitigate all the impacts of climate change, but it will reduce the biggest impacts,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what we need to hope for.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, consumers may have to deal with more nuts and fruits in their chocolate, or reach for different types of candies altogether.",
      "Younger consumers may already be leading the way. The NCA cited Gen Z and millennial consumers\u2019 taste for \u201call things sour, flavor mashups, different textures, and flavor experiences\u201d for helping drive a 5.4% jump in sales of non-chocolate candies in 2024 \u2014 a bigger uptick than either chocolate or gum and mints saw last year."

The operators can charge users hefty transaction fees, and the stores often receive payment for hosting the BTMs.",
      "Food Lion, the store Marianne visited, referred questions to Coinstar, which said in a statement that it is \u201ccommitted to consumer protection\u201d at its kiosks. Coinme, a platform that partners with Coinstar to sell cryptocurrency, said it was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to learn of the incident.

      "Last fall, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., then the chair of the Judiciary Committee, and six other senators contacted the 10 largest companies running crypto ATMs and asked how they were preventing fraud against seniors. Many, like Coinme, display on-screen warnings and disclaimers. At least two companies said they require older customers to speak with agents before they complete transactions.",

      "Indian tariffs on imported goods averaged 11.5% in 2022, according to the World Bank, compared with 1.5% in the United States, and Trump has called India a \u201ctariff king\u201d and a \u201cbig abuser\u201d of trade ties.",

      "Unless peace quickly comes to Ukraine and the International Olympic Committee and Moscow suddenly repair their long-fraught relationship, Russian athletes could be largely frozen out of their second consecutive Olympics.",
      "\"With only one year to go, we're looking at a similar situation in Paris,\" said David Wallechinsky, a\u00a0former president\u00a0of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \"You don't know 100%, but I'd say there's a strong likelihood that Russia will not compete ... as an independent country\" in the 2026 Winter Games.",
      "Russia was largely absent from Paris last summer, with only a handful of its athletes qualifying as neutrals. The only medal it won was in women's doubles tennis, in which Mirra Andreeva\u00a0and\u00a0Diana Shnaider captured silver.",

      "\u201cSports is super important for Russia. It\u2019s very important internally, because Russia usually fields very strong teams in international sports competitions, so it tends to validate for the Russian population the power of Russia,\u201d said Thomas J.

      "At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin surely had an inkling that his invasion would probably have a terrible impact on Russia's future Olympic aspirations, said Mietek Boduszy\u0144ski, who teaches U.S. foreign policy at\u00a0Pomona College in Claremont, California.",
      "\"Let's say that he did take Ukraine and took it quickly. That wouldn't have reduced the outside world outrage, right?\" Boduszy\u0144ski said. \"But I guess in the end, the prize of taking Ukraine was bigger, bigger than\" the risk losing Olympic participation.",
      "But Kent believes Putin rolled the dice with hopes that backlash against Russia would have subsided by Paris 2024 and surely in time for Milan Cortina 2026.",
      "\"I think that they thought that the conquest of Ukraine would be very quick and very successful and that any international resistance would blow over,\" Kent said. \"And in Olympic terms, [it would blow over] in time for 2024 or maybe the next [2026]. While I don't think it was their top issue, I do not think they expected international condemnation to be as strong as it was or that Ukrainian resistance to be what it's been.\""

Unlike Belle, Milla actually has cancer. (The real Belle Gibson admitted\u00a0to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s\u00a0The Weekly\u00a0in 2015.)",
      "In the show, doctors find a rare cancer \u2013 called pleomorphic sarcoma undifferentiated \u2014 in Milla\u2019s arm. Rather than follow their recommendations and amputate, the 22-year-old opts for an alternate medical regimen involving juice and coffee enemas. She builds a career on the idea that she healed her cancer holistically. It seems to work for a while, until the cancer comes back. This time, the spread is fatal and Milla dies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the facts and fiction of Milla.",
      "Who is Milla Blake based on in real life?",
      "\u201cMilla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers at the time,\u201d Debnam-Carey tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cWe created Milla as her own thing. That was what was so great about it \u2026 we could boost her up so that she could be going toe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "She says the character was inspired in part by\u00a0Jessica Ainscough, the editor of a teen magazine who was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma, a rare cancer, when she was 22, and nicknamed\u00a0herself\u00a0\u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Ainscough and Milla share similarities. In Ainscough\u2019s now-deleted blog post on her five-year diagnosis anniversary in 2013, viewed on the Internet Archive, Ainscough remembered hearing of a sacrcoma diagnosis.",

      "Warning: Major spoilers ahead for Season Six of \"Cobra Kai\"...",
      "At its core, \"Cobra Kai\" follows the redemption of Johnny Lawrence, the recipient of Daniel LaRusso's infamous crane kick at the end of 1984's \"The Karate Kid.\"",
      "Often maligned as one of the core villains of the '80s franchise, \"Cobra Kai\" explores what happens to a bully decades after he's beaten. Over the show's six seasons, Johnny, the series' \"hero,\" Daniel LaRusso, and the next generation \u2014 including their children \u2014 have sparred, forged reluctant alliances and even become friends.",
      "But \"Cobra Kai\" is Johnny's story. And the final season, which dropped on Netflix Feb. 13, drives that point home.",
      "The show, which premiered in 2018 on YouTube Red before later moving to Netflix, opened with Johnny on the heels of losing his handyman job, dealing with alcoholism and estranged from his teenage son. By the series finale, he's a proud husband, father and stepdad and a business owner, and he left the All Valley Sports Arena \u2014 the setting of the All Valley Karate Tournament way back in 1984 \u2014 again a champion.",
      "Ralph Macchio \u2014\u00a0who plays Daniel, Johnny's rival turned friend \u2014 has said that the \"Cobra Kai\" finale embraces the \"big '80s movie ending.\"",
      "\"It has that element of all the feels, the tears and the cheers of an '80s film,\" Macchio tells TODAY.com. \"It's sort of going back to the roots of overcoming obstacles, wish fulfillment, aspiration, victory ... all that stuff that you used to go to the theater and get your popcorn and jump out of your chair and high-five the person next to you. It really ends in that way.\"",
      "But Part Three starts in a dark place. For a refresher, the worldwide karate tournament, the Sekai Taikai, ends in tragedy at the end of Part Two, with one young competitor dying on the mat.",
      "Macchio says the sacrifice was necessary to revisit Cobra Kai in a \"positive light.\"",
      "\"Earning that was the challenge, in a show that's kind of a karate soap opera, as I call it,\" Macchio says. \"It raised the stakes. You had to hit rock bottom for it to come back and bring it back to all those elements that you want to see, that is the essence of 'The Karate Kid' lore.\"",
      "Here's how it all went down.",
      "Who dies in \u2018Cobra Kai\u2019 Season 6?",
      "Season Six proves to be \u201cCobra Kai\u2019s\u201d bloodiest \u2014 and deadliest \u2014 season yet.",
      "The Part Two finale, Episode 10, saw the Sekai Taikai, at the time set in Barcelona, interrupted after a massive fight on the mat.",
      "Throughout the season, the Iron Dragons, a Hong Kong-based dojo led by Sensei Wolf (Lewis Tan) and, for a time, Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith), dominate the Sekai Taikai. Cobra Kai, led by John Kreese (Martin Kove) and fighters Kwon (Brandon Lee) and Tory (Peyton List), are in second. Miyagi-Do just barely makes it to the semifinals, at which Sam (Mary Mouser) and Robby (Tanner Buchanan) are set to compete.",
      "In the middle of Robby\u2019s semifinal match against the Iron Dragons' Axel, an eliminated team attacks the tournament\u2019s organizer, starting a brawl between all of the dojos. Amid the chaos, Kreese tries to go after Silver with a eunjangdo, a small knife, but drops it.",
      "Kwon finds the knife and tries to use it against Axel. But Kwon has his leg swept in midair, and he falls on the blade. Daniel rolls Kwon over, the blade sticking out of his chest.",
      "The Sekai Taikai is seemingly canceled, and Part Three opens with a monthlong time jump. But a desperate (and dying) Silver convinces organizers to resume the tournament in California.",
      "Reeling from the death of Kwon, Kreese backs out of the fight. Silver and Wolf, however, seek victory by any means possible.",
      "In Episode 14, with Johnny and his team still in contention, Silver concocts a contingency plan to threaten Johnny's new wife, Carmen (Vanessa Rubio), and their infant daughter. But his plans are foiled by Kreese, and the former friends again face off, this time on Silver's yacht.",
      "Silver, fighting with a broken bottle, gets the upper hand and almost chokes Kreese. But the scuffle knocks over a tank of gasoline, and Kreese, always armed with a cigar, throws the smoldering stick into the spill, causing a giant explosion.",
      "The episode ends with the boat going up in flames, and Kreese and Silver, presumably killed in the blast, aren't seen again.",
      "Who wins the Sekai Taikai in \u2018Cobra Kai\u2019?",
      "The outcome of the Sekai Taikai is revealed in Episode 15, titled \u201cEx-Degenerate.\u201d And in hindsight, \"Cobra Kai\" only could have ended like this \u2014\u00a0Johnny getting a chance to re-do the fight that he credits with ruining his life.",
      "\"Ever since '84, I always wanted a do-over,\" Johnny says in the series finale. \"And now that it's here, I feel like it's some giant setup to label me a loser for the rest of my life.\"",
      "But this time, instead of facing Daniel, Johnny's being trained by him.",
      "After the tournament resumes after Kwon's accidental death, Robby from Miyagi-Do leaves the competition with a serious leg injury at the hands of Axel. Sam chooses not to fight after realizing it's impossible to make up the overall point deficit, leaving Daniel and Miyagi-Do to gracefully bow out of the competition.",
      "So, the only hope to defeat the Iron Dragons becomes Cobra Kai. With Kreese gone, Tory is left without a sensei and without a male counterpoint to fight in the men's final. Enter: the original duo that restarted Cobra Kai, Johnny and Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a).",
      "In the penultimate episode, Tory and Miguel beat the Iron Dragons' Zara and Axel to become Sekai Taikai individual champions. But in the overall competition, the dojos' cumulative points stand tied. Requiring a slight suspension of disbelief, the rules of the tournament state that a tie can only be broken by a fight between senseis, meaning Johnny has to face Wolf.",
      "To prepare, Johnny asks Daniel to be his sensei, and the former rivals train on a California beach in an elaborate montage set to, of course, \"You\u2019re The Best.\" As the match starts, Daniel dons Cobra Kai's signature black gi.",
      "The fight starts roughly for Johnny after Wolf threatens him in the locker room, and illegal moves abound. Wolf takes a quick and early lead, bringing the score to 2-0. But before the championship point, Daniel calls for a timeout and gives Johnny a pep talk, the likes of which viewers have never seen from Daniel before.",
      "\"Stop acting like a little p---- and get out there and kick the living s--- out of this a------,\" Daniel says, after reminding Johnny of the tenets of Cobra Kai.",
      "The score becomes even at 2-2, and Daniel calls another timeout to remind Johnny of what he learned at Miyagi-Do \u2014 balance. As the final round starts, the episode flashes back to Johnny and Daniel's fight at the end of \"The Karate Kid.\"",
      "Back in the present, Johnny and Daniel exchange a wordless nod, and Johnny takes Kreese's advice from so long ago \u2014 he sweeps the leg. Johnny wins the final point, and the team hoists him onto their shoulders as the crowd screams his name.",
      "Cobra Kai is named the winner of the Sekai Taikai, and Johnny and Daniel hold up the trophy together.",
      "What's next?",
      "The rest of the characters all seemingly get their happily ever after. Tory and Robby are offered a sponsorship deal to continue to compete in karate tournaments. Sam chooses to study abroad in Okinawa, and Miguel gets into Stanford.",
      "It briefly seems like Daniel might be hanging up his gi, telling his wife, Amanda (Courtney Henggeler), that the Sekai Taikai's \"not a bad way to go out.\"",
      "\"Who the hell are you kidding? You\u2019re always going to be a sensei,\" Amanda responds.",
      "Johnny reopens Cobra Kai \u2014 but teams up with Daniel to also teach the practices of Mr. Miyagi.",
      "In the final scene, Johnny and Daniel sit down for a meal at a restaurant to discuss the upcoming All Valley tournament. When a fly starts buzzing overhead, Daniel, recalling a lesson from Mr. Miyagi, tries to catch it with his chopsticks. But Johnny smacks his hands over the bug, killing it.",
      "\"No mercy,\" he says, the final line of the show.",
      "Macchio tells TODAY.com that the series ends with Daniel and Johnny \"still opposites.\"",
      "\"But somehow they found a way, and each will enhance their lives,\" he says. \"Johnny and Daniel enhance each other's life.\"",
      "Daniel's story will continue in \"Karate Kid: Legends,\" which hits theaters May 30. Starring Macchio as well as Jackie Chan \u2014 the mentor figure of the 2010 remake of \"The Karate Kid\" \u2014 the film will see the two team up to train a new fighting prodigy.",
      "Macchio confirms that \"Karate Kid: Legends\" will pick up \"a few years\" after the events of \"Cobra Kai.\"",
      "\"We land Daniel LaRusso in 'Cobra Kai' in a way that when we see him in 'Karate Kid: Legends,' it makes sense that that's where he is,\" he says. \"And then we through line little things he says that make sense from what we saw on 'Cobra Kai,' without it being a continuation of 'Cobra Kai.'\""

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 For years, the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has been a rare island of dialogue in an increasingly divided city, but an Israeli police raid on the store this week has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech.",
      "While the well-known store and its smaller branch across the street were open Tuesday, the bust saw detectives confiscate books in trash bags and arrest two members of the owner\u2019s family. The incident has raised broader concerns about the status of shared places where Israelis and Palestinians can peacefully come together and debate.",
      "\u201cI, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Israel, said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cI am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,\u201d he added.",
      "The store, founded on Salah al-Din Street in 1984 by the Muna family, sells books in many languages that largely focus on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has long been known in the area as an intellectual oasis where readers from across the political divide can share ideas.",
      "Security footage from Sunday afternoon that the Muna family shared with NBC News showed plainclothes officers rifling through books and taking away some of them in garbage bags.",
      "During the raid on the predominantly English-language store, officers also arrested the manager, Mahmoud Muna, and his nephew Ahmad. Both have since been released.",
      "Mahmoud\u2019s brother, Morad, said that the police had taken books with a Palestinian flag or icon printed on them and that they used Google Translate to help understand what the material was saying.",
      "\u201cIn our book, anyone from any religion, from any side, can say his opinion without being afraid. He can discuss any kind of thing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn the west side of Jerusalem, there are English bookstores that have the same books that we have, and you will never hear that they arrested the owners,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Israeli police said that the two were arrested on suspicion of \u201cselling books containing incitement and support for terrorism at bookstores in Jerusalem.\u201d",
      "Police added that the detectives had confiscated from the store \u201cnumerous books containing inciteful material,\u201d pointing to the children\u2019s coloring book titled \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d written by South African author Nathi Ngubane, as one example. The police added that they had also raided a bookshop in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City last week, which had material supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State group.",
      "The title of the coloring book is also a pro-Palestinian slogan often used at protests against Israel and refers to the geographical area between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
      "The American Jewish Committee says on its website that the slogan \u201ccan be used to call for the elimination of the State of Israel and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews living there,\u201d while the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies protested the publication of the book when it was initially released.",
      "Wasim Khalis, who owns a clothing store next door to Educational Bookshop, said he had been drinking coffee in the bookstore around 3 p.m. local time when four plainclothes officers entered. After a few minutes, he said, the officers flashed a warrant and asked customers to leave, while a second group of officers went across the street to another store owned by the family.",
      "\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new store; it has been here for decades. They took items that were very normal and could be found anywhere, including on the internet.\u201d",
      "Some 10 diplomats including those from the European Union and the United Kingdom sat in on a debate Monday on the Munas\u2019 release date at Jerusalem\u2019s District Court. Meanwhile, supporters of the Educational Bookstore wrote about their alarm at the raid online, with a smaller number gathering outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cWe fear that the raid on the store, the confiscation of books from it, and the imprisonment of its owner under the pretext of \u2018violating public order\u2019 is a regime provocation designed to erase the Palestinian cultural narrative and harass those involved in it,\u201d Israeli author Ilan Sheinfeld said in a post on X.",
      "One of the in-person protesters was Galit Samuel, an Israeli patron who had traveled from Tel Aviv to be there. She said of the Munas that \u201cthey are both men of peace, and they are promoting Palestinian culture in peaceful ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that such people were arrested and books were confiscated,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave attack on free speech and free thinking.\u201d"

      "'Army in detention'",
      "In northern Syria, around 10,000 alleged ISIS fighters are locked away in 28 jails, the largest of which is Al Sina Prison on the edge of the small city of Hasakah.",

      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners. Battles raged around the prison for over a week until they were eventually quelled with the help of the U.S. military.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe have intelligence that ISIS is planning to attack the prisons again, because the prisoners are considered to be a primary force for them,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIf they find a way out, ISIS will be able to reorganize and reconstitute.\u201d",
      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",
      "'One of the most dangerous camps in the world'",
      "On a barren stretch of desert roadway, just 26 miles east of Hasakah, is the sprawling Al Hol Camp \u2014 home to around 40,000 people, 93% of whom are women and children, according to the most recent figures from the United Nations, published last February.",
      "Many of them are the families of ISIS fighters and SDF officials said the camp was considered a breeding ground for the next generation of militants.",

      "Inside the camp, in a section dubbed The Annex, the wives of foreign ISIS fighters and their children are held, around 6,000 people from 51 countries. Many of their governments have shown little or no interest in repatriating them in the six or so years they have languished in the camp.",
      "Considered by the SDF to hold the most extreme residents in the whole camp, The Annex is fenced off from the rest of the facility, with guard posts standing at the exit.",

      "Women gather together, all fully covered in the Islamic niqab, as hundreds of young children from strikingly diverse ethnic backgrounds wander through the squalor. There is little electricity or running water, and their patchwork plastic tents offer meager protection against Syria\u2019s winter chill.",
      "In another part of The Annex kids chant \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d while raising a single finger in the air, a trademark of ISIS. After hurling vulgar insults and threatening violence, they start to throw stones."

    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "The fossil of a Jurassic bird unearthed in southeastern China has major implications for the history of avian evolution, researchers say.",
      "The newly discovered Baminornis zhenghensis, a quail-sized bird, roamed the skies some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, meaning it is among the oldest birds known to mankind, along with the iconic Archaeopteryx that was discovered in Germany in 1862 and is of similar age.",
      "\u201cFor more than 150 years now, Archaeopteryx has stood alone,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a University of Edinburgh paleontologist who wrote a commentary accompanying the study.",
      "\u201cDuring all of that time, it has remained as the only unquestionable bird fossil from the Jurassic Period,\u201d he told NBC News in an email.",
      "While there have been other birdlike Jurassic fossils found here and there, Brusatte said, there was a \u201chuge mystery and a frustrating gap\u201d in the fossil record: If Archaeopteryx was flying by then, other birds must have been too. So where were their fossils?",
      "The 2023 discovery of Baminornis in Zhenghe county in China\u2019s Fujian province, now among the most important discoveries since Archaeopteryx, helps fill that gap, he said, making it the \u201csecond unquestioned bird from the Jurassic Period.\u201d",
      "Unlike the half-bird, half-reptile Archaeopteryx, which had a long and skinny tail similar to that of a velociraptor, Baminornis had a short tail with some of its vertebrae fused into a short, stubby nubbin called a\u00a0pygostyle \u2014 a crucial aerodynamic feature that pushes the body\u2019s center of mass toward the wings, similar to those in modern-day birds that help them fly better.",
      "Until the discovery of Baminornis, short tails had been found only in birds known to have lived around 20 million years later,\u00a0such as Eoconfuciusornis and Protopteryx.",
      "\u201cWhat excites me most is that it is a more advanced bird than Archaeopteryx, and it could fly much better,\u201d Brusatte said.",
      "Baminornis was much more anatomically complex than Archaeopteryx, which Brusatte said was a \u201cprimitive\u201d bird with claws and sharp teeth like its dinosaur ancestors.",
      "Archaeopteryx, which played a crucial role in determining that today\u2019s birds evolved from dinosaurs, was a \u201ctextbook example of a creature caught in the act of evolution like a freeze frame,\u201d he added.",
      "The vast difference between the two similarly aged birds, discovered about 5,500 miles apart, has led the team behind the Nature study to believe that avian evolution occurred millions of years earlier than previously thought, with the estimate now at about 164 to 172 million years ago.",
      "In addition to dozens of fossils of aquatic or semiaquatic animals, the Zhenghe Fauna collection, as it\u2019s referred to, includes at least three fossils so far that belong to the group including birds and their closest relatives. The researchers said this suggests the collection holds great potential to \u201cenrich our understanding of early bird diversification\u201d and \u201cfill a critical gap in the evolutionary history of terrestrial ecosystem\u201d toward the end of the Jurassic period.",
      "Though the Baminornis fossil preserved much of the skeleton, the feathers were not preserved, leaving unanswered questions about the size and structure of its wings. It was also missing the skull, limiting clues about the bird\u2019s diet.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cBaminornis tells us that a variety of birds lived during the Jurassic, and they flew in different ways,\u201d Brusatte said."

      "The most destructive bit of the cyclone could hit coastal areas between De Grey and Karratha on Friday night.",

      "Haiti\u2019s children are increasingly caught in the crossfire of gang violence, forced to carry weapons, spy on police and rival gangs and run errands for gunmen, according to a report released Wednesday by Amnesty International.",
      "One of 51 children interviewed by the human rights group said he was constantly pressured by a gang to fight alongside it.",
      "\u201cThey killed people in front of me and asked me to burn their bodies. But I don\u2019t have the heart for that,\u201d the unidentified boy was quoted as saying.",
      "An estimated 30% to 50% of gang members are now children, according to UNICEF.",
      "Amnesty International said the children \u201chad no choice, and that their involvement was predominantly out of hunger or fear.\u201d",
      "Nearly two million people are on the verge of starvation in Haiti, and more than one million children are estimated to be living in gang-controlled areas, with 85% of the capital of Port-au-Prince under their rule.",
      "One unidentified boy, 16, said he\u2019s paid to run errands for a gang.",
      "\u201c(The gangs \"are in control. And there is nothing you can do about it,\u201d he was quoted as saying.",
      "If children refuse to follow a gang\u2019s orders, they or their family would be killed, according to the report, which relied on a total of 112 interviews and research done from May to October last year.",
      "Children are not only in danger of gangs, but of vigilantes and police officers who believe they\u2019re working for them, according to Amnesty International.",
      "Girls and young women also have been collectively raped by gang members and infected with sexually transmitted diseases, often ending up pregnant in a country where health care is extremely limited.",
      "One teen was raped by six men, and her sister by five others.",
      "\u201cThere was so much blood,\u201d the unidentified younger sister said in an interview.",
      "Another teen recounted how she drank bleach to try and kill herself after having a baby after being raped by three men who then left her naked in public.",
      "\u201cPeople found me on the street and put a dress on me,\u201d she said.",
      "Amnesty International said many of those interviewed \u201cscoffed at the idea of reporting their attacks to authorities.\u201d",
      "A 16-year-old girl who was abducted and raped by several gang members said: \u201cAre you kidding me? It\u2019s not possible\u2026There is no police\u2026The only chief in town are the gang members.\u201d",
      "The violence also has led to injury and death.",
      "One girl, 14, recounted how a ricocheting bullet pierced her lip in September 2024. Three months before that, her 17-year-old brother died from a stray bullet.",
      "\u201cI lost a huge presence in my life. Since then, I don\u2019t know how to be happy,\u201d the girl said.",
      "The violence is especially punishing on children with disabilities, with some recounting how they had to leave behind crutches and wheelchairs during sudden gang attacks in their neighborhoods.",
      "Amnesty International called on the Haitian government to better support children, restore education, provide mental health services, and resume court proceedings against children suspected of ties to gangs who are being held without charge.",
      "It also said more resources including training and security are needed to help reintegrate children into society.",
      "\u201cThe international community cannot continue to make empty promises,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe country needs immediate and sustained technical and financial assistance to rescue a generation of boys and girls from being lost to repeated cycles of gang violence.\u201d",
      "In 2023, 128 children were reported killed, according to the U.N. While the figure wasn\u2019t available for last year, more than 5,600 people were reported killed in 2024, the organization found.",
      "Haiti\u2019s National Police, which is severely underfunded and understaffed, is working alongside a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to help quell gang violence.",
      "However, the mission lacks funding and personnel, and the U.S. and other countries have been pushing to transform it into a U.N.-peacekeeping mission."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said that he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone Wednesday about ending the war in Ukraine and that Putin indicated he would be willing to negotiate directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"As we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social about their first known call of his second term.",
      "\"We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations,\" he added. \"We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.\"",
      "Trump said he tasked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff with leading negotiations with Russia.",
      "Putin adviser Dmitry Peskov said the phone conversation lasted about 90 minutes.",
      "\"The topic of the Middle East settlement, the Iranian nuclear program, and bilateral Russian-American relations in the economic area were talked about during the conversation,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Putin invited Trump to visit Moscow, Peskov said, \"and expressed readiness to receive American officials in Russia regarding areas of mutual interest, including, of course, the topic of Ukrainian settlement. Putin and Trump also agreed to continue personal contacts, including setting up a personal meeting.\"",
      "Trump later confirmed that he had spoken to Zelenskyy, saying in another post on Truth Social that the discussion \u201cwent very well\u201d and that Zelenskyy also wants peace. Trump said a meeting related to the war, led by Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, would take place Friday in Munich.",
      "\u201cI am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive. It is time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION. God bless the people of Russia and Ukraine!\u201d he wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy said on X that he had a \"meaningful conversation\" with Trump. \"No one wants peace more than Ukraine,\" he wrote. \"Together with the U.S., we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace. As President Trump said, let\u2019s get it done.\"",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a visit to NATO's headquarters in Brussels that it's \"unrealistic\" for Ukraine to return to its borders before Russia invaded its Crimea region in 2014. He also signaled that the United States wouldn't support Ukraine's joining NATO as part of a negotiated deal to end the war.",
      "The Trump administration also helped secure the release of American teacher Marc Fogel from Russia on Tuesday in exchange for the release of Alexander Vinnik, a convicted money launderer who is in U.S. custody and was awaiting transportation back to Russia by the end of the week. Russia had detained Fogel for 3\u00bd years after he was arrested for possessing medical marijuana.",
      "Trump suggested Sunday that he had already spoken to Putin \u2014 which would have been their first known call since 2022 \u2014 though Peskov said Sunday that he would \u201cneither confirm nor deny\u201d that a conversation took place.",
      "Ukraine-Russia relations have remained tense since the war began in February 2022.",
      "Last month, Zelenskyy said on X, \u201cPutin once again confirmed that he is afraid of negotiations, afraid of strong leaders, and does everything possible to prolong the war.\" The comment came in response to Putin's telling a Russian state broadcaster that Zelenskyy \u201chas no right to sign anything\u201d because of his \u201cillegitimacy.\u201d",
      "The resurrection of a potentially positive U.S.-Russia relationship is a departure from the last four years. The Biden administration imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia over the last three years, and President Joe Biden also authorized numerous aid packages to Ukraine to provide both humanitarian assistance and weapons and equipment.",
      "It's unclear whether the Republican-led Congress will continue supporting legislative aid packages to Ukraine, as many GOP lawmakers have opposed continuing to fund the U.S. effort to defend Ukraine, a close ally. Even in the last Congress, divisions among GOP lawmakers significant delayed deliveries of weapons to Ukraine.",
      "Trump has for years, including Wednesday, claimed that the war never would have happened had he been president at the time of the invasion. On the campaign trail, including in a meeting with Zelenskyy in September, he repeatedly said he would negotiate a deal between Russia and Ukraine that's \"good for both sides.\" Last month, he also suggested that Ukraine shouldn't have fought back against Russia's invasion.",
      "He has also said he would end the war before his second term began or on the first day of his new administration."

He was initially extradited to France and later to the United States.",
      "He pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit money laundering related to his role in operating the cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e from 2011 to 2017, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California said in news release at the time.",
      "\u201cBTC-e was one of the primary ways by which cybercriminals around the world transferred, laundered and stored the criminal proceeds of their illegal activities,\u201d the release said.",
      "The exchange \u201creceived criminal proceeds of numerous computer intrusions and hacking incidents, ransomware attacks, identity theft schemes, corrupt public officials and narcotics distribution rings,\u201d it said.",
      "Vinnik was facing up to 20 years in prison and had been due to be sentenced in January. But in November, a U.S. federal judge agreed to postpone his sentencing until June in a brief order that did not cite the reason for the delay, according to court records, Reuters reported.",
      "The U.S. official said Vinnik was exchanged for Marc Fogel, who was freed Tuesday after being detained in Russia for 3\u00bd years for a minor medical cannabis infraction.",

      "Fogel had remained in Russian custody as U.S. authorities\u00a0won freedom\u00a0for other high-profile American detainees, including Griner, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich and former Marine\u00a0Paul Whelan.",
      "Fogel said that he needed time before he could discuss the conditions of his imprisonment in detail, but that they were difficult.",
      "\u201cThere were times when it was extremely trying. There were times when I could manage it,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery second, every minute, every day had a challenge.\u201d",
      "The U.S. envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that three additional hostages, including a U.S. citizen and a journalist for Radio Liberty, a global news outlet, had been released by Belarus into American custody.",
      "The United States did not release any detainees in exchange for the hostages, Boehler said. He did not name the U.S. citizen.",
      "Boehler said the new releases were the continuation of a hostage release agreement that began last month with the release of American Anastassia Nuhfer."
